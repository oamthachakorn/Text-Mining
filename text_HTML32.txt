Argus FMB Sulphuric Acid
Issue 15-22 | Thursday 11 June 2015
Market summary
Sulphuric acid market balanced
In Europe, spot availability is not abundant but any spot demand has also been met. Brazil imported over 320,000t of sulphuric acid in the first half of 2015, based on total ship- ments arriving in Brazil, which is up a sharp 68pc on 1H 2014 (totalling around 190,000t). Despite the increase of spot enquiries (and the fact that Europe fulfils most of Brazil’s requirements), spot prices there have been relatively stable and the latest business confirmed to be done was in the prevailing range of $83-88/t cfr.
Asia is also balanced. The previous tightness in Asia, as tes- tified by around eight sulphur-based acid cargoes being sold by Chinese producer Two Lions since the start of 2015, has eased. Two recent spot tenders in the Far East, where two smelters have sold 60,000t and 40,000t of acid for 2H 2015 lifting, were concluded between $30/t and the low-$30s/t cfr. This suggests that the traders who took these forward loading cargoes are unwilling to pay higher than the current spot Japan/South Korea assessment for the remainder of the year. The restart of the Pasar smelter in the Philippines, still scheduled to be in July, and the shutdown of two Japanese smelters in the final quarter, may cancel each other out and result in a stable Asian acid market in the second half of the year.
There is a noticeable trend in the acid trade as more direct contractual business is being agreed between producers and buyers, particularly those who are consuming significant quantities. An example is fertilizer giant OCP, who already has contracts with producers in Bulgaria and Spain and is understood to be in discussions with other acid producers for long-term supply contracts.
News of Nyrstar’s plan to operate three 20,000t sulphuric acid tanks in Antwerp by the end of 1Q 2016 also extends a trend that the market has seen in recent years - producers and suppliers working on improving their logistical flexibil- ity, adding value to their service and working directly with end-users.

Outlook: A balanced market in the east and the west testified by stable prices despite stronger-than-expected demand in India and Brazil recently. Worries over the out- look persist in certain regions, including Chile, as spot price indications soften.
Highlights this week
Nyrstar is building 3 x 20,000t sulphuric acid storage tanks at the port of Antwerp, Belgium. The tanks are ex- pected to be operational by the end of the first quarter of 2016.
mid-$160s/t cfr. India still needs to buy sulphur and DAP for the rabi season.
Aramco's July lifting price at $144/t fob (reflecting close to $160/t cfr China) is considered a modest increase that has surprised some observers. The increase is $2/t over the June number.
Outlook: For the next 30-60 days there remains likely modest price gains on the back of a stable-to-firm phos- phates market.
Demand - Leaching and industrial

metal climbed to $13,575/t on 10 June - a near-four-week high.
Zinc is struggling to reverse its steady month-long de- cline, levelling out at $2,166/t on 10 June. High output and global stock levels are thought to be the reasons for the slow decline in value.
Sulphuric acid this week
Demand - Fertilizers and agriculture
Phosphate suppliers on the whole are comfortable and those with unsold tonnes, particularly for Latin America, and do not feel under pressure in anticipation of further seasonal demand emerging.
On the demand side, India and Latin America remain the focus although trade activity in India has slowed slightly on adequate supply for the kharif season.
Chinese producers are set for a fairly comfortable 3Q against continued demand from India, Pakistan and South- east Asia. Moreover, Latin American MAP demand will also provide some Chinese producers with an additional outlet although this shipping window will likely close before the end of July for the product to arrive in time.
Elsewhere on the supply side, the Saudis have made a partial switch to MAP which will limit DAP supply for India and Pakistan while the Moroccans are sold out for June.
Outlook: The global market will still be stable-to-firm.
Belgium – Nyrstar plans to 
Chile – A sale of 
acid has been complet- ed by a smelter acid producer, reportedly to BHP Billiton. The price is understood to be in the mid-$70s/t cfr, and the cargo is for July arrival.
Germany – Chemie Kelheim Holding has declared force majeure on deliveries from its Kelheim sulphur burner, which broke down this week.
India – Price ideas have been easing on both sides, with sell- ers quoting in the $50s/t cfr east coast India, and buyers looking for the $40s/t cfr.

Chile
The Chilean market has seen little import movement in recent weeks, compounded by the floods in late March this year that reduced logistical flexibility significantly in region
IIand III. Some buyers have had to sell tonnes/buy tonnes off other consumers, others delaying their import needs that were previously anticipated to materialise by the second half of 2015.
Around 10,000t of Chilean sulphuric acid have been sold by a major producer, reportedly to BHP Billiton, in the mid-$70s/t cfr for July arrival.
The last time the buyer was linked to spot buying was for imported tonnes for end-May delivery, concluded in the
high-$70s/t cfr with a trader. Before that, Zaldivar sold 10,000t of acid to KGHM's Franke mine in early/mid-April at $76/t fca (equivalent to the very low-$70s/t cfr Mejillones).
Argus FMB has assessed the Chilean cfr spot price down to $70-79/t to reflect the current market sentiment in Chile. A producer suggests that buyers, who have little need for spot tonnes at present, are looking to buy at under $70/t cfr.
The softer prices in Chile have also been attributed by some to the Antofagasta’s Antucoya project that is still in the process of ramping up production. This suggests that some of the sulphuric acid meant for Antucoya has had to be diverted. Most of the acid diverted went to Antofagasta’s other two operations, Michilla and Centinela, and there are reports of some tonnes having to be diverted to other mar- ket players hence putting downward pressure on spot prices.

The operation has a nameplate consumption rate of 450,000- 500,000 t/yr of acid.
Draft restriction still in place in Barquito
The effects of the March flooding are still lingering in some parts of Chile. In Barquito, the local authority has kept the 8m draft restriction in place, while the Ferronor rail line remains closed indefinitely. The rail line - part of which is owned by Codelco and services the Potrerillos smelter - is undergoing a major repair operation which will cost up to $1.5mn/km of track repaired.
But despite the Ferronor rail line being down, Codelco has been meeting its sulphuric acid deliveries ex-Potrerillos to customers via truck, which began on 29 April.
availability of sulphur-based acid for export should theoreti- cally be down as well.
Boleo produced its first copper in 1Q 2015 and mining opera- tions already started in the first semester of 2014. The proj- ect sources prilled sulphur from Oxbow out of North America and will be capable of producing up to 700,000-800,000 t/yr of sulphuric acid.
Brazil
Paranapanema is currently taking delivery of 8,000t on the MTM Penang at Aratu.
Yara is understood to be looking for spot tonnage for July delivery.
Mexico
Around eight shipments have been shipped out of Santa Rosalia, where Minera y Metalúrgica del Boleo (Boleo) runs a copper leaching operation, since the beginning of this year.
In January, the Bochem Singapura went to Rio Grande. The Mid Fortune delivered some acid to Chile in late January/ early February. In mid-February the Chemstar Massa went to Chile. Fairchem Silver loaded acid in March, April and May for shipment to Chile. Chemstar Stellar loaded in early April and first half of June, also for shipment to Chile.
This contributed to the sharp jump in acid deliveries from Mexico to Chile in the first four months of the year. Chile customs data showed that 778,000t of sulphuric acid were delivered to Chile in January-April, and 15pc of the total, or 118,000t came from Mexico. Grupo Mexico is another sup- plier of sulphuric acid to Chilean buyers but the quantities have dropped since 2012 as more shipments went to Chile from Grupo Mexico’s subsidiary in Peru: Southern Copper Corporation.
But Boleo exports is not expected to be a long-term trend going forward.
Boleo is running its sulphur burner at a high rate in order to benefit from the steam credit, as there is no external energy available in the vicinity of the operation. Its copper leach- ing operation is estimated to be consuming around 15,000 t/month of sulphuric acid at present and will be ramping up its operating rates by June 2015. At present, the leach- ing plant is consuming less than the acid plant is producing, and as a result the company has been left with an excess of sulphur-based acid. Once the leaching unit is ramped up,
North America
US
In the freight market, the MTM Houston has been fixed to deliver 19,000t from Pori, Finland or Ronnskar, Sweden, to east coast US via a trader.
The cargo will load between 1 and 10 July, and the freight is understood to be around $44/t. Currently, freight rates from Benelux to the USG are estimated at $38-42/t.
Market participants agree that the US import price range remains at $70-80/t cfr.
Africa and Mediterranean
Morocco
There have been discussions again regarding OCP’s sulphuric acid requirements this year as OCP’s new finished fertilizer complex is on target to come on stream within 2015.
There are expectations for the fertilizer giant to import at least 600,000t of sulphuric acid this year, and majority of that should come under contracts with acid producers direct.
The granulation unit – part of the new fertilizer complex - will be online early July; the accompanying sulphuric acid plant is already operational and the phosphoric acid unit will be on stream sometime in June. This fertilizer unit is fully dedicated to Africa and is flexible in producing DAP/MAP/ NPK and NPS, therefore it remains to be seen how much sulphuric acid OCP will require.

Last year was an unusual year as Morocco imported around 890,000t of acid according to customs data; for 2012 and 2013 Morocco’s imports averaged 500,000t on an annual ba- sis. Many are sceptical that OCP will need 800,000-900,000t of sulphuric acid again this year with a new sulphuric acid plant now operational.
There are indications that recent spot business going into North Africa is still in the range of $50-60/t cfr, while con- tractual levels are close to $40/t cfr.
Europe
Nyrstar builds three tanks in Antwerp
Nyrstar is building 3 x 20,000t sulphuric acid storage tanks at the port of Antwerp, Belgium. The tanks are expected to be operational by the end of the first quarter of 2016. The storage capacity will receive production from Nyrstar’s Balen zinc smelter in Belgium and Budel zinc smelter in the Netherlands.
The smelter acid producer sometimes exports out of Ant- werp but this activity is restricted by barge traffic: there are understood to be around 11 barges available, each taking around 450t, servicing between its smelters and Antwerp. With the new storage capacity, the flow of barge traffic should even out throughout the year, potentially opening up more export opportunities for the producer.
This continues a trend that has been seen in the past year or two, as more tanks are being planned/built or leased out as sulphuric acid producers and suppliers work on improving their logistical flexibility and adding value to their existing service. As previously reported, in Chile Puerto Mejillones and Interacid are building one tank each at their terminals. In the US, October 2014 saw Westway Group commission four sulphuric acid storage tanks in Houston, Texas, with a com- bined capacity of about 30,000t, which is leased by Glen- core. SATCO, a subsidiary of Interacid, added a sulphuric acid tank earlier this year with capacity of about 20,000t in Mobile, Alabama.
Force majeure declared at Chemie Kelheim
Chemie Kelheim Holding's sulphur burner in Kelheim, Ger- many halted operations on 9 June and subsequently declared force majeure on sulphuric acid deliveries. During a planned two-week turnaround at one of the two sulphuric acid lines, which began on 6 June, the second line suffered technical problems and went down on 9 June and remained offline at
press time. The sulphur burner has a normal production rate of 120,000 t/yr sulphur-based acid, most of which goes to the domestic market. While it is unclear how much produc- tion has been lost as a whole, there are expectations that the operations can resume in two weeks' time.
Sachtleben Chemie running at reduced rates
The Duisburg sulphuric acid plant, also in Germany and owned by Sachtleben Chemie, is running at reduced rates because one of the two ovens is reportedly down, though reasons are not known. The unit has a capacity to produce 100,000 t/yr of sulphur-based acid and 250,000 t/yr of re- covered/regenerated acid.
European contract negotiations for 3Q/2H to begin
Third-quarter and second-half contract negotiations will begin soon and, compared with the second quarter, a more optimistic sign is that the euro has strengthened against the US dollar.
In terms of market fundamentals, a majority from the buy and sell sides agree that the European domestic market is in balance at present. Suppliers and buyers suggest that if any- one needs tonnage, there is not a lack of product available.
Producers and suppliers are likely to be targeting a slight in- crease for 3Q/2H contracts. For buyers, a decrease has been voiced by several players. What happens with molten sulphur contract prices in the third quarter will also have a bearing on smelter acid contract price negotiations. Second quarter acid prices were rolled over from the first quarter.
KGHM replaces flash furnace in 2016
KGHM has plans to put in a flash furnace at its Glogow smelter in the second half of 2016. The unit has production rate of 120,000 t/yr of sulphuric acid. While the replacement work should last around two months, it is not yet confirmed how much acid will be lost as a result next year.
Boliden's Harjavalta smelter back online
Boliden's Harjavalta smelter in Finland has restarted since planned maintenance work began in mid-May.
Umicore's Hoboken smelter restarts
Following a seven-week shutdown for expansion work, Umi- core's Hoboken lead-copper smelter restarted this week. The smelter produces 100,000-120,000 t/yr of sulphuric acid and more expansion work is expected to take place in the next few years.

India: sulphuric acid discharge/arrivals in May-Jun 2015
PPL is understood to be looking for a cargo of 19,000t for ar- rival during the first half of August. The company has made enquiries to traders and producers.
After a flurry of spot purchases, demand for spot sulphur is slowing and buyer price ideas are easing off. Buyers have been bidding in the $40s/t cfr east coast India. There are unconfirmed reports of suppliers willing to offer the $50s/t cfr although last confirmed spot business in India is in the region of $61-69/t cfr.
Japan/South Korea
Spot availability remains steady in the Far East, with some major smelter acid producers understood to have sold car- goes in recent weeks. Forward sales for 2H 2015 deliveries have been recently concluded at $30-32/t fob South Korea/ Japan.

The country has imported 211,762t in the period January-April 2015, with imports from Boliden in Sweden and Finland being by far the largest suppliers, after neither country had shipped acid to Brazil in the first three months of 2014. This indicates that Brazil's need for acid has increased on last year.
