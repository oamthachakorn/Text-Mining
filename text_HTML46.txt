ANALYSIS
Southeast Asia potash prices fall further
Potash prices in Southeast Asia were assessed to have dropped within the last week as the Lunar New Year is just around the corner.
Prices across Southeast Asia were stable except for Malaysia, where a major supplier confirmed a February arrival vessel of 30,000 mt at around $260/mt CFR. Although the price falls within the low end of last week's range, other indications suggest that some pressure still remains as the tender season winds down.
Vietnamese MOP prices continue to hold at the upper end of the range at $295/mt CFR although this could change in the coming weeks with Vietnam’s application season nearing. If demand in the country increases, some suppliers may attempt to push for higher prices, increasing the width of the region’s assessed range.
Some major global suppliers were hoping to talk business with Brazilian importers at last week’s FLA conference in Cartagena, Colombia but those meetings did not take place. Indications are that the price in Brazil is stable this week but confirmed deals in the $230s/mt CFR could be seen within the month if demand does not accelerate, as some traders expect it to do between now and March.
Indian importers are now expecting potash subsidy rate cuts of $22-29/mt, which would further add to their arguments for a significantly decreased 2016 contract price. According to sources, many traders are anticipating it to be agreed at between $240-270/mt CFR. Given the country’s 1.6-1.8 million mt inventory level, this would not be surprising and negotiations could be noticeably delayed, following as similar trend to those in China.
In China, the port wholesale price is assessed unchanged at RMB 1,980-2,200/mt FCA in the lead up to New Year festivities. Once contract talks begin, likely at the end of February, negotiations will be slow because the country does not need to bring in any foreign tonnes over the next couple months.
US potash values held relatively steady with only a modest decline reported at New Orleans for imported barges. In the Midwest, modest movement from distributors to retailers and to the fields continued this week thanks to hard ground. These pre-spring applications of potash (and phosphates) are typical this time of year. This suggests Q1 demand in the key US corn and soybean growing region of the Midwest will be in line with prior years.
Highlights of the Week:
∙Japan December MOP imports down 51% y-o-y
∙Malaysia MOP price sees $5/mt decrease
∙Brazil January through September imports down 8% y-o-y
∙US NOLA barge prices assessed lower
∙Indian importers expect higher subsidy rate cuts
∙Colombia November MOP imports up 44% y-o-y
∙Mexico November MOP imports down 72% y-o-y
Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade- weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the
spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.
MARKETS
MOP
NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: Barge offers drift lower
Imported potash barges continue to inch lower as some importers continue to accept lower bids in order to reduce their positions ahead of the expected reopening of the upper Mississippi River system in mid-late March. The bottom of this week's range was cited at $205/st FOB, although some suppliers are holding out for at least $210/st FOB.
Mexico: November MOP imports down 72%
Mexico imported 9,283 mt of MOP in November, a decrease of 72% from the same month in 2014, according to the latest customs data via GTIS.
Of this, 6,307 mt was shipped by SQM. This can be compared to November 2014, when the Chilean producer sent 12,756 mt to Mexico. Uralkali and Canpotex each loaded around 1,000 mt in November 2015.
The month’s MOP imports brought Mexico’s January through November total to 243,068 mt – 17% more than in the same period of 2014, despite the decreased November shipments.
SQM remained the country’s largest supply partner, having shipped 94,904 during the 11 months of 2015, compared to 70,907 mt the year before. Mexico imported 74,677 mt from Canpotex and 64,895 mt from Uralkali, respective increases of 27% and 10% from 2014.
US Midwest: Some truck sales at latest postings
New granular potash sales from distributors to retailers are sparse, but reports from the Midwest suggest the $260/st FOB price tag sought by some Canadian suppliers has been accepted in the market. So far only about a $5/st discount is indicated for some, but not all, offshore material.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Colombia: November MOP imports up 44%
Colombia imported 50,657 mt of MOP in November, a 44% increase from the same month in 2014, according to the latest GTIS data.
K+S shipped 28,829 mt to the Latin American country in November, up from 4,885 mt in November 2014. The remainder of the tonnes were shipped by Uralkali (12,760 mt) and Canpotex (7,061 mt).
January through November, Colombia imported 516,087 mt MOP, a 13% increase from the same period in 2014. Uralkali, the country’s largest supplier, shipped 234,584 mt during the 11 months of 2015, compared to 169,617 mt in 2014.
Colombia also imported 175,464 mt from Canpotex and 76,107 mt from K+S, with the former decreasing shipments by 5% and the latter increasing shipments by 69% from the same period of the previous year.
Brazil: Jan-Dec MOP imports down 8% y-o-y
Brazil imported 292,489 mt of MOP in December, down from the 657,396 mt it received in the same month of 2014, according to Anda data.
Canpotex was the country’s largest supplier with a market share of 35% for the month. BPC supplied 25% of the imported product, while 14% came from Uralkali and 13% from K+S, according to GTIS data.
In the full year of 2015, Brazil imported 8.3 million mt MOP, a decrease of 8% compared to the 12 months of 2014. Of this, 34% of the tonnes were imported via Canpotex.
Other January through December shipment shares were held by BPC (20%), Uralkali (17%) and K+S (15%). Brazil imported the remainder of the full-year volumes from ICL and SQM, a total market share of around 12%.
Potash consumption in Brazil was up slightly in December compared to the same month of 2014. It totalled 327,501 mt, a year-on-year increase of 4%, according to Anda. However, consumption in the full year of 2015 was 5.2 million mt, down 4% from the 12 months of 2014.
Brazil’s MOP production in December was 28,113 mt, a minor decrease on the December 2014 level of 29,147 mt. The country therefore produced 279,138 mt in the full year of 2015, down just over 2% from 2014.
Some major potash suppliers were hoping to conduct business with Brazilian importers at last week’s conference in Cartagena but this did not happen. There are now expectations that demand, and subsequently trading, will increase in March.
The business price range in Brazil remains $240- 250/mt CFR and demand is still weak, sources say. There has been a lack of indications to suggest that prices in the $230s/mt CFR deserve to form part of the range, despite previous suggestions of deals at $235/mt CFR.
On a positive note, some sources have said that farmers are starting to make more money off of their trading, which could contribute towards increased demand later on in Q1. Producers are also reportedly attempting to work with partners in the country who are not bankrupt in an attempt to make more regular agreements.
The Brazil granular bulk MOP spot price is assessed stable at $240-250/mt CFR.
EUROPE
Southeast Asia: Slight price drop following pressure
The assessed range for the Southeast Asia MOP spot price has been lowered to $255-295/mt CFR following reports of continued market pressure last week.
Prices across the region were said to be stable with the exception of Malaysia, where indications ranged from $250-260/mt CFR. According to one seller, business can be seen at as low as $250/mt CFR although there are no confirmed deals below this low end.
One major supplier confirmed a February vessel bound for Malaysia with 30,000 mt standard MOP at a price of around $260/mt CFR. There are no confirmed tenders to report in the region as the season nears its end but there could be two more that have yet to be announced, sources say.
Indonesian prices are still higher than in Malaysia at around $270-280/mt CFR based on most indications but there are no new deals to report.
In Vietnam, the high end of the current range has reportedly been maintained by suppliers despite previous suggestions that it would slip. Shipments are expected to start arriving in February, in line with the application season. Standard MOP is still seen at around $295/mt CFR, with granular priced at around $315/mt CFR, according to sources.
Europe: Demand remains weak as buying season looms
The granular MOP buying season in northwest Europe is expected to start in the next few weeks although farmers in the region remain relatively inactive for now, according to sources.
Recent rainfall in the Benelux countries has not helped the current lack of business as farmers have not been using fertilizers. Potash demand remains low, partially because farmers are in no rush to consider application.
There could be a slight rise in granular MOP prices once demand increases but this is not likely to happen until the buying season begins, sources say.
At the beginning of January, some product was flowing freely because it was ready to be transported. However, warehouses then filled, resulting in pressure on prices as producers described the need to try to move tonnes. It now appears as though previous discounted offers have failed to spur demand.
The northwest Europe granular MOP market is assessed unchanged again this week at €280-290/mt CIF with no new confirmed business to report.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
South Africa: December MOP imports down 41%
South Africa imported 40,263 mt of MOP in December, 41% less than it did in the same month of 2014, according to GTIS data.
Chile’s SQM supplied 31,401 mt of this, 23% more than in November 2014. The lower monthly import volume can be attributed to decreased K+S shipments, which totalled 8,796 mt in November compared to 20,500 mt in November 2014.
In the full year of 2015, South Africa imported 377,367 mt of MOP, a meagre 1% drop from 2014 volumes. Of this, SQM shipped 135,362 mt, an increase of just 1,000 mt compared to 2014.
Other shipments throughout the 12 months were received from APC (90,800 mt), K+S (86,622 mt), Uralkali (41,950 mt) and ICL (17,566 mt).
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Importers expect higher subsidy rate cuts
Potash importers in India are now expecting 2016-17 subsidy rate cuts of INR 1,500-2,000 ($22-29)/mt, according to sources.
This, combined with potential discounts on the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) in the country, may result in low breakeven prices for importers, given current ideas that the 2016 contract will be agreed at somewhere between $240-270/mt CFR.
If subsidy rates are cut by $22-29/mt, importers’ breakeven would be around $225-230/mt CFR, taking MRP decreases and a US dollar to INR ratio of 1:68 into account.
Alternatively, if the subsidy rates were cut by the same range and there was a further INR 1,000 ($15)/mt decrease on the MRP of INR 16,000 ($237)/mt CFR, then importers would have a breakeven of as low as $215-225/mt CFR after considering capital requirements for four to six months due to the high inventory level.
Given how low these potential breakeven prices are next to the expected range of the new contract, importers would likely try to maintain margins through reducing MOP discounts.
Potash inventories were estimated to be 1.6-1.8 million mt as of the end of January. As a result, most suppliers are continuing to offer heavy discounts in the range of INR 2,500-3,000 ($37-45)/mt.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Lunar New Year approach slows activity
The Chinese MOP port wholesale spot price is assessed unchanged at RMB 1,980-2,200 ($301-335)/mt FCA as the country’s residents prepare for New Year festivities.
It has become increasingly evident that negotiations over the new contract price will be difficult this year. They are expected to start at the end of February.
Large suppliers across the global markets are waiting for the benchmark that the new contract will establish, but there will be little news to report on this front over the couple weeks.
In the full year 2015, China imported more than 9 million mt of MOP for the first time since 2007. Much of this tonnage will need to be sold on before a formal agreement to bring in regular shipments over the next year is agreed.
Japan: Dec MOP imports down 51% y-o-y
Japan imported 19,150 mt of MOP in December, a decrease of 51% from the same month of 2014, according to GTIS data.
Of this amount, 8,239 mt were received from BPC, which increased its monthly market share to 43% from just 6% in 2014. Uralkali shipped 5,509 mt, up from 2,805 mt, while Canpotex decreased its shipments to just 1,536 mt from 16,174 mt in December 2014.
The December tonnes bring Japan’s full year 2015 import volume to 494,113 mt, down from 534,365 mt in the full year of 2014. Canpotex remained the country’s largest supplier despite decreasing its shipments by 11% year on year to 346,959 mt.
Other full year 2015 imported volumes were from Uralkali (43,065 mt), BPC (40,761 mt) and K+S (27,546 mt).
Philippines: October MOP imports more than triple
The Philippines imported 16,081 mt of MOP in October 2015, according to the latest customs data via GTIS. The amount is up from 5,853 mt in October 2014.
Canpotex, the largest Phillippines' largest supplier, shipped 12,027 mt in October, a 75% increase from the same month of the previous year.
Between January and October, the Philippines imported 129,095 mt of MOP, up from 106,739 mt from the same period in 2014. Of this, 61,724 mt arrived via Canpotex.

K+S cuts saline waste production by 50%
K+S cut its saline waste water production by 50% at the end of 2015, in line with the timing of its original goal to do so, according to a company press statement.
The potash producer said that it invested about €400 million ($437.2 million) in new facilities in order to reduce the amount of saline waste that it was creating in Germany to 7 million cubic metres.
“Water protection is an integral part of our sustainable potash production and an important condition for the preservation of almost 4,500 jobs in the Werra-Fulda potash district,” K+S Managing Director Dr Rainer Gerling said.
Further measures are expected through to 2017 via the Hessen state government’s four-phase disposal plan, which will further reduce waste water production by 1.5 million cubic metres per year.
In December, K+S was given the permission to continue with limited injections of waste at one of its potash plants into the Werra river until December 21 by the Kassel Regional Council. This was even though
the authority is not expected to complete its technical assessment of the company’s waste disposal until the summer of 2016.
