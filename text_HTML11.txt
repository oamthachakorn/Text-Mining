Market summary
Signs of upward price trend
The market stabilization has continued, and in the Baltic, fob prices have climbed slightly this week to the $390-400/t fob level, up from $390-395/t fob last week.
A fire at the Brunsbuttel ammonia plant in Germany which broke out last week has led to a shut down of the plant, and as a result Yara has secured 20,000t of ammonia out of the Baltic for July loading which it will ship to Germany. Yara says the tonnage was sourced from more than one Baltic supplier and was priced at around $400/t fob Ventpils and Sillamae.
In Turkey, Trammo has been awarded the Petkim tender for 6,000t for early-July delivery at a price of close to around $410/t cfr, suggesting a Yuzhny netback of around $380/t fob.
CJ Indonesia has awarded its tender for 6,000t for early- July delivery to local supplier Petrokimia Gresik in the late $440’s/t cfr . The tender received an offer of $490/t cfr from Trammo and an offer over of above $500/t cfr from another trader, it is understood.

Trammo has sold a cargo into South Africa, most likely for both Foskor and Omnia. At least some of cargo is due to be loaded on the Berlian Ekuator from Saudi Arabia this week. Pricing and volumes of the cargo could not be confirmed by press time; Trammo said the delivery was not a swap with Muntajat.
Market Outlook: Slight firming trend
Europe
Yuzhny
Yuzhny pricing was stable/slightly firmer this week. Trammo has purchased around 20,000t from NF Trading for load- ing on the Touraine, priced at around $390/t fob according to Trammo. NF Trading declined to comment on this price however. In addition, Trammo has bought around 3,000t of DniproAzot ammonia at a price of around $400/t fob. The volume is below our 5,000t minimum cargo size to be in- cluded in our price assessment, so the Yuzhny price for this week is quoted at the $380-390/t fob level, but the outlook looks slightly firmer. The low-end level of $380/t fob reflects estimated netbacks on recent sales done into Turkey.
Ameropa has just completed loading the Gas Snapper which will be delivered to Jordan, under a cfr sale to Muntajat to cover its delivery to JPMC.
Koch’s Jenny N is expected to arrive around 25 June to load 40,000t of Togliatti ammonia for delivery to the US.
Baltic
Yara has secured 20,000t of ammonia out of the Baltic for
July loading which it will ship to Germany. Yara says the tonnage was sourced from more than one Baltic supplier and was priced at around $400/t fob Ventpils and Sillamae. The Ventspils fob price is this week assessed at $390-400/t fob – up from $390-395/t fob last week.
Koch is expected to load around 5,000t of Togliatti ammonia from Sillamae next month, under an earlier purchase from Ameropa. The vessel has yet to be nominated but it is likely that further Baltic tonnage will be secured to load on the same vessel.
Turkey
Trammo has been awarded the Petkim tender for 6,000t for early-July delivery at a price of close to around $410/t cfr, suggesting a Yuzhny netback of around $380/t fob. Ameropa is also understood to have offered into the tender but the price offered has not been disclosed.
Bagfas is expected to import around 9,500t in early July, but its following ammonia cargo could be around 23,000t once its new 30,000t tank capacity is fully operational by 2H July.
Germany
Yara’s ammonia unit in Brunsbuettel suffered a fire on 10 June. There were no casualties or serious injuries and dam- age to the plant was minimal, Yara said. The 750,000t/yr
Yuzhny line up for June 2015

ammonia unit and consequently the 620,000tpa urea unit remains down. For the time being preparation for restart are ongoing. Yara will import an additional 20,000t into Germany next month as a result, this will be used for urea production and deliveries to its industrial customers.
Middle East and Africa
Saudi Arabia
The Safco V urea unit continues to run trial production and Sabic says the indications for performance are positive.
Sabic loaded 23,000t on the Rose Gas on Monday for delivery to East Asia. Meanwhile Trammo was scheduled to load 12,000t on the Berlian Ekuator this week and the vessel is destined for South Africa. Trammo will also load around 11,000t from Jubail on the Brussels in the coming days and this vessel is also scheduled to load 10-12,000t from Ruwais which was purchased from Fertil last week. Trammo has one other 23,000t cargo to load from Sabic at the end of this month, but the vessel nomination has yet to be confirmed. The final vessel expected to load from Ras al-Khair this month will be the al-Barrah which Sabic will deliver to East Asia.
Issue 15-24 | Thursday 18 June 2015
South Africa
Trammo has sold a cargo into South Africa, understood to be for both Foskor and Omnia. At least some of cargo is due to be loaded on the Berlian Ekuator from Saudi Arabia this week. Pricing and volumes of the cargo could not be confirmed by press time. It is understood the sale has been done directly and is not a swap with Muntajat.
UAE
Trammo is loading the 10-12,000t cargo it purchased from Fertil on the Brussels this week from Ruwais. The vessel is also loading around 11,000t from Saudi Arabia over the coming days. The cargo will be delivered to South Korea and China.
Algeria
Sorfert reports this week that both of its ammonia units and its urea line are running normally. Yara is scheduled to load the Navigator Gusto from Sorfert in the coming week. OFT has loaded 15,000t from Sorfert earlier this month on the Navigator Galaxy. The vessel is scheduled to arrive in Rot- terdam on 23 June.

Indian subcontinent
India
Transagri reports that its latest sale to IFFCO this week was priced at $402/t cfr. The cargo loaded from Iran on the Ever- rich 6 and discharged at Kandla today. However it is under- stood that IFFCO’s 12,000t cargo from CIFC which is also ex-Iran and due to be delivered in the coming days to Kandla on the Gas Line has been priced sharply above this.
The India price for this week is assessed at $402-465/t cfr.
Asia Pacific
China
The ammonia price in Hebei province remained stable at around RMB2,500/t ex-works this week. However prices in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces dropped by around RMB100/t.
early July delivery. It is understood that the cargo will be delivered by Mitsui and will be sourced from Indonesia.
Indonesia
CJ Indonesia has this week awarded its tender for 6,000t for early-July delivery to local supplier Petrokimia Gresik in the late $440’s/t cfr . The tender received an offer of $490/t cfr from Trammo and an over of above $500/t cfr from another trader it is understood.
Mitsui is expected to deliver the 15,000t it purchased from Kaltim last week at $437.50/t fob, to Gladstone, Australia.
The KPI plant in Indonesia has commenced a maintenance turnaround which should be complete by early/mid-July.
Australia
There continue to be reports of production problems at the Pilbara plant but confirmation could not be obtained from Yara.
Orica has been looking to purchase a cargo for end-June/
Americas
US
Prices in the US ammonia market continued to soften this week with the end of side dress season hastened by a sud- den and severe bout of wet weather hitting the east Corn Belt. Corn is now expected to be too tall for further ap- plications by the time saturated soils have dried out. This has caused an earlier than expected cut-off for offtake this season, and could result in increased carryout for suppliers in the region.
In Oklahoma, offers have moved to the $470-480/st fob range. Meanwhile, there are reports a Texas producer is sell- ing summer-loading tons at $450/st fot. Last summer, prices at Oklahoma production sites bottomed at $440/st fob in June before topping $600/st fob by in August.
