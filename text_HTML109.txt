UREA
ANALYSIS
Indian tender fails to provide expected clarity
While at the centre of attention over the week, the April 10 STC tender in India offered limited clarification on forward pricing for urea. The low offers that were used by STC to counter suppliers did not spark significant selling interest from sources outside Iran.
Chinese producers with costs at the low end of the curve will undoubtedly have been interested in pursuing part of the business, but the call by the Chinese Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association not to accept bids into the low $250s/mt FOB appears to have sidelined the vast majority of Chinese producers.
Traditional Middle East suppliers have also opted not to book any tonnage via traders with STC, and have concentrated on disposing tonnage via existing contracts and spot sales to other destinations instead.
The strategy has so far paid off via sales to Latin America at returns above $260/mt FOB, and the producers are also enjoying improved netbacks from the US market. Trades in granular urea barges were flat to higher this week, as that market is out of range to new supply at this stage for the spring season. The only
exception to this would be shipments from the Caribbean, but much of that production is being taken offline temporarily by PotashCorp. The company has idled its Trinidad and Tobago urea unit in favor of ammonia sales, which yield better margins at this time.
Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports indicate that extended rain in Louisiana in recent weeks and months has slowed work on CF's planned urea expansion. That plant likely will begin commercial operations in August rather than July, as previously indicated.
While Mexican and Central American importers have paid up to secure granular urea for April and May, Brazilian importers appear content with purchases to date, and are yet to get on the band-waggon for significant price increases. A purchase this week was up by a mere $3/mt on last week's low end. Traders' perceptions on forward values in Brazil in paper markets are entirely different. Firm April 16 bids for May positions at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $270/mt CFR were countered with offers at $273/mt CFR. Postings for April were at $262-268/mt CFR, but these obviously do take into account the Index numbers of the prior April weeks.
The limited success by STC to secure substantial quantities to date has influenced traders' perceptions of the market, and the April 10 session will likely be followed by an early May tender to procure additional tonnage on top of the STC volume.
Opinions on pricing in a follow-up tender differ widely, but higher CFR values appear necessary to trigger widespread acceptance by suppliers other than Iran. Traders having shorted the market at low numbers argue that the flip side of that coin is the need for China to dispose of inventories.
Some movement of port inventories back into the domestic market in China is however already evident, suggesting that some producers feel more comfortable building stock for the domestic market that they would be in facing the low bids currently available. Bearish observers write the movement off as a short-term strategy designed to convince buyers that availability is not as abundant as it is in reality.
In the Black Sea, the market has remained relatively stable, and the combination of traders covering prior short sales and prospects of 150,000 mt to be shipped to Egypt by the end of July continued to stem the slide in prices. Baltic values for prilled and granular urea remain under pressure, but the boosted values for granular urea into Latin America will provide some support to prilled prices in the region.
Highlights of the week
∙A slow week despite the STC tender
∙Offers to STC in April 10 tender abundant in $270s/mt CFR
∙But quotes in $260s/mt CFR fail to attract significant selling interest
∙US granular values rebounded somewhat, demand outpacing supply chain to interior
∙Middle East netbacks move above $260/mt FOB in sales to Mexico and C. America
∙Brazilian granular values improve marginally, but still far behind other markets
∙Egyptian April 18 tender for 150,000 mt prills eagerly awaited by FSU suppliers
∙Pakistan urea tender not yet in sight
∙Netbacks on European granular still below $280s/mt FOB from Egypt
∙Qafco III, V and VI running well
∙Safco V commercial urea output maintained for mid-May
Short term outlook
Mixed, but the floor suggested in prior weeks was found for Middle East granular, albeit conceivably temporary. Forward short-term values will largely depend on US barge prices and on European willingness to cover summer and fall requirements at prevailing prices rather than sit back, hoping for further discounts over the slow summer months.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
Mexico: Tepeyac books Middle East granular
While not confirmed by the traders, CHS and Ameropa were widely associated with sales of full cargos of Middle East granular urea to Mexico this week. Tepeyac booked one cargo around $288/mt CFR Manzanillo. Isaosa was negotiating a similar sized lot, but confirmation that a deal had been closed was not available at press time.
US Southern Plains: Granular urea rebounds as weather finally supports field work
Truck values moved up about $5/st from last week's lows thanks to seasonal demand finally getting underway with vigor across most of the region, after weeks of delay due to wet weather. Current postings are $325-335/st FOB along the Arkansas River and in Texas, with strong demand for corn, silage crops, rice and cotton across the south.
US Midwest: Granular urea movement spikes as corn planting underway
Granular urea is moving fast from Midwest warehouses, with most of the activity reported from northern and western positions as corn planting gets underway. The surge in demand was sufficient to pull Midwest prices up $5-10/st this week, with a range of $330-340/st FOB covering most of the week's business. Distributors are borrowing tons from each other to meet not only spot demand but also pre-paid sales that have yet to be backed by deliveries from suppliers out of the US Gulf. Not only have weather conditions delayed barge movement, but domestic traders noted too many players waited too long to buy into the market to cover earlier sales. Many believed US prices had not stopped their long fall that began in Q1.
US NOLA: Odd spread emerges in New Orleans values
Despite early sales of granular urea near to $280/st FOB New Orleans, and as much as $310/st FOB paid for barges positioned along the upper Mississippi River, some cheap sales still occured. The low end of the week's range was $261/st FOB New Orleans paid for a non-Chinese barge.
Regardless of the lower-priced business, many traders expect to see another couple of weeks of firm prices ahead. Despite this view, forward offers for May are widely available at $270/st FOB for barges in the Gulf.
Prilled urea is oversupplied in the US Gulf, with material originating from the FSU, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Qatar on offer as low as $260/st FOB.
US Northern Plains: Wider spread emerges
A wider than expected spread has emerged in the Northern Plains market, with buyers in the Dakotas finding some spot tons priced based on more recent replacement costs out of the US Gulf.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Trinidad and Tobago: Sharply lower urea values lead PotashCorp to cut output
PotashCorp has idled its granular urea unit, the only such plant in Trinidad and Tobago, starting this month in favor of selling more ammonia into the export market. The driver behind the decision is the plunging value of urea versus ammonia globally. Returns on new urea sales to some of Trinidad's key markets in North and South America arguably would be as little as $240/mt FOB, given values in those markets.
The move also coincides with reduced gas availability in Trinidad and Tobago for all nitrogen producers due to the ongoing work to improve logistics and bring new offshore gas platforms on line. The National Gas Co. has indicated an 11-day curtailment at about a 15% rate starting this week, but indications from the gas distributor historically have been optimistic. Therefore, sources at PotashCorp were not willing to predict how long the urea unit would be down.
Brazil: Paper values for granular urea up, but physical market yet to follow
Bids for CFR Brazil granular urea positions on FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $273/mt CFR for May were up by $11/mt on bids posted April 14, but importers of physical tonnage had yet to adjust bids accordingly.
One part-cargo off an inbound carrier traded this week at $263/mt CFR. The stronger sentiment in Middle East urea nevertheless appears set to necessitate significant upward moves on the part of importers to be able to access additional tons from traders and producers. Offers from traders were no lower than $280/mt CFR at press time.
Peru: Ameropa set to ship from China
Ameropa has been in the freight market for a vessel to load a combination of prilled and granular urea for a total quantity of 30,000 mt to five ports Peru against its prior sale. The trader was seeking a vessel to arrive Yantai/China by April 20 for loading.
Central America: EuroChem books Incofe tender and CHS books Mayafert
The April 10 Incofe tender for 20,000 mt prilled urea and 5,000 mt granular urea in combination with 10,000 mt AN was awarded to EuroChem for all products that are to be loaded by May 15. The prilled urea wil be shipped to Cortes/Honduras (15,000 mt) and Santo Tomas/Guatemala while the granular urea will load for Limon/Costa Rica.
The 10,000 mt AN will be split between Cortes (6,000 mt) and Santo Tomas (4,000 mt). Mayafert was linked to a purchase of a full cargo of granular urea of Middle East origin from CHS. Exact details on pricing in the transactions have not been released.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Trading still subdued and prilled urea prices flat
The recent boost to Middle East granular values has yet to positively impact prilled urea values in the Black Sea, and producers have so far maintained targets around $260/mt FOB for late April and May. Sales are however also suggested down to $255/mt FOB, and the price-point has been posted accordingly.
It is uncertain whether OPZ will begin selling some of its urea via electronic auctions late April as has been widely reported, but the Interbank Currency Exchange statement issued last week left little room for doubt that this will actually occur.
Suppliers are meanwhile concentrating on executing open business where shipments and firm nominations from Yuzhnyy are now above 90.000 mt for April with the addition of the T. Bayaraktar with 5,000 mt for Mekatrade to the list below:

(1)cargo from TIS - DneproAzot
(2)incl. 20,000mt from TIS - DneproAzot
Baltic Sea/Belarus: GrodnoAzot to tender April 17
GrodnoAzot has floated a tender for the sale of 25,000 mt each granular and prilled urea to load from the plants late April/early May. The session is set to close April 17.
EUROPE
UK: Urea imports through February up substantially
Imports of urea by the UK in February of 67,000 mt as identified by GTIS were up by 1.5% on the prior year. Russia accounted for 19,000 mt, up by 228% and Algeria supplied 14,000 mt, up from zero.
The January-February volume of 180,000 mt was up by a significant 36.7%. Arrivals from Netherlands accounted for 34,000 mt, up by 38% on the prior year and deliveries from Russia of 33,000 mt were up by 63%. Egyptian shipments of 27,000 mt were up by 5.3%. Qatar, Algeria and China leaped from zero to 24,000 mt, 21,000 mt and 6,000 mt, respectively.
Romania: Slow market but stable netbacks
No new sales of prilled urea have been reported this week, but low offers into Turkey for dutiable FSU tonnage reflected netbacks around $253/mt FOB for FSU material, for a $270/mt FOB Romania equivalent. The FOB price-point has been maintained accordingly.
Romanian exports of urea in January as identified by GTIS were a mere 14,500 mt, down by 58% on the prior year. Exports to Serbia of 8,300 mt were up from zero while Turkey accounted for about 2,900 mt, down by 13.6%. Calendar 2014 exports of 468,000 mt were down by 6.2% on 2013.
Netherlands: Urea imports and exports in January down year-on-year
Imports of urea by the Netherlands in January identified by GTIS of a mere 4,600 mt were down by a full 90.6% on the quantity imported in January 2014. The drop followed imports of 153,000 mt in calendar 2014, up by 14.4% on 2013.
January urea exports of 36,500 mt were down by 67.1% on January 2014. Exports to the US of 18,500 mt were up by 745.4% on the prior year. The 2014 total exports of 1.58 million mt was up by 31.1% on the calendar 2013 volume.
Germany: January urea imports up marginally while exports drop 10%
Imports of urea by Germany identified by Eurostat via GTIS of 110,000 mt in January were up by 1.1% on last year. Russia accounted for 52,600 mt of the total, followed by Algeria with 12,400 mt and by Poland and the Netherlands with about 12,000 mt each. The minor January increase followed 2014 imports of 696,000 mt that were up by 8% on the prior year.
German urea exports in January of 74,000 mt were down by 10.4% on the prior year. Exports to Canada were flat year on year at 11,000 mt while deliveries to the UK of 8,600 mt were down by 36%. Poland and France accounted for about 7,400 mt each. Total 2014 exports from Germany of 951,000 mt were up by 2.75% on the 2013 volume.
Spain: New sales marginally below last week
As in the case of France, granular urea values in Spain are flat to soft. One sale into a Spanish Mediterranean port was concluded this week at $302/mt CFR, duty paid, presumably with 90 days credit, down marginally on sales last week.
Spanish urea imports in January identified by GTIS of 92,000 mt were down by 43% on January 2014. Arrivals from Algeria of 29,000 mt were up by 135% and deliveries from China were up from zero to 16,000 mt. China accounted for 16,000 mt, up from zero, and Iranian deliveries went from zero to 14,000 mt. Supplies from Egypt of 7,000 mt were down by 50% on the prior year.
France: Granular volatility yet to impact local prices
The latest uptick in granular urea values in the Middle East have yet to trigger significant spot purchasing activity in the French Bay and in Mediterranean ports. Sales for early May delivery have been concluded this week at $303-308/mt CFR French Mediterranean ports, duty paid. The $308/mt CFR reflects around an even €300/mt FCA at the current €/$1.071 exchange rate, but spot sales are still reported for small quantities from warehouses in the French Bay at €305-310/mt FCA. Offers for summer-fill and forward positions are suggested below €290/mt FCA in the Bay.
February imports of urea into France identified by GTIS of 131,200 mt were up by almost 22% on February 2014. Algeria accounted for 24,000 mt, up by 63% while deliveries of 23,000 mt from Russia were down by 27%. The January-February total of 243,000 mt was nevertheless off by 12.6% on the prior year. Algerian deliveries of 55,000 mt were up by 55% while shipments from Egypt of 42,000 mt were down by 17%. Russian arrivals of 41,000 mt were down by 30%.
Turkey: Buyers talking but no new sales
Activity in urea has slowed in recent days following the purchase by Gemlik of the PIC/GPIC cargo of granular via Ameropa. A major buyer is in discussions with suppliers for a parcel of 6-8,000 mt for April or early May loading for Samsun, but no purchase had been concluded at press time. An initial low offer was suggested below $275/mt CFR duty unpaid including 180 days credit, indicative of producer netbacks around $255/mt FOB at sight if shipped from the Black Sea.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: Physical and paper-values for granular urea rebound
The market for granular urea inched higher in recent trades in the physical market and in paper-markets. A cargo of SIUCI granular reportedly traded in the low $260s/mt FOB to Keytrade, up by more than $14/mt on netbacks from prior Brazilian sales, and also up on last week's assessed netbacks from the US barge- market. Two further cargos for late April loading was suggested sold by Fertil at similar numbers, reportedly purchased by CHS and intended for Latin America.
Paper markets also went up significantly. Firm offers posted on FIS Cash Settled Swaps April 16 for May positions at $265/mt FOB were countered with bids at $260/mt FOB. The average was up by $10/mt on quotes posted earlier in the week. The April 16 bid-offer range for June was up to $258-263/mt FOB and the spread for July at $257-260/mt FOB.
In prior deals, Trammo is in the freight market for 36-38,500 mt PIC granular urea to load from Sitra or Shuaiba for Paranagua and Aratu/Brazil in April 23-25 laydays.
Netbacks from contract markets such as Thailand are still below $2560/mt FOB, but returns on US contract cargos priced via formula are up this week as reflected in the price-point assessed at $265-273/mt FOB.
Iran: Pardis suggests relatively high netbacks in April 14 sales tender
Iranian producer Pardis Petrochemical Co. is indicating netbacks well above $255/mt FOB were secured in sales of around 250,000 mt urea to traders intending to dispose of the material to STC in India in the April 14 sales session for the tonnage to load in April and May.
Ahead of the PPC tender, indications from Iranian producers were marginally below $255/mt FOB, permitting traders to generate a small margin basis counters from STC at $268.50/mt CFR Mundra and $269.22/mt CFR Kandla. Freight for a large carrier to Mundra is assessed around $9/mt plus transaction costs. A provision for added interest will also need to be added due to the reimbursement clause incorporated in
the tender that allows STC to effect payment on receipt of funding from the DoF.
Iran: Q1 urea exports exceed 500,000 mt
Exports of urea from Iran registered by customs via GTIS in March 2015 of 184,000 mt were up sharply on the 21,400 mt exported in March 2014. The main destination was India which absorbed 75,000 mt, followed by Italy with 55,000 mt, Brazil with 27,000 mt and Afghanistan with 15,000 mt.
The March volume brought Q1 exports to 503,000 mt, up by 210% on Q1 2014. Brazil was in the lead with 143,000 mt, up from zero in Q1 2014. India followed with 131,000 mt, up by 53% on the prior year. Deliveries to Iraq of 66,000 mt were up by 75% and shipments to Italy of 55,000 mt were up from zero in Q1 2014. Belgium and France accounted for about 33,000 mt each:

INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: STC issues urea awards, but quantity stuck at 360,000 mt
Latest reports from Delhi confirm that STC secured acceptance for 360,000 mt urea so far. One cargo of 60,000 mt will have been booked by MTPL per their low offer for Krishnapatnam at $266/mt CFR and Global will have booked the 60,000 mt for Mundra at its $268.50/mt CFR offer plus 60,000 mt at the
offered $269.22/mt CFR Pipavav. Pricing for those three lots were the basis for the counters from STC, and thus entailed a simple acceptance on the part of the importer to secure the quantities. Global also booked an additional 30,000 mt.
Transglobe reportedly booked 150,000 mt, but confirmation on all the quantities via issuance of STC Letters of Intent was awaited at press time.
Awards were all based on STC counters per below:
-$266.00/mt CFR Krishnapatnam, Gangavaram and Karaikal
-$267.00/mt CFR Vizag and Kakinada
-$268.00/mt CFR Chennai and Tuticorin
-$268.50/mt CFR Mundra
-$269.22/mt CFR Kandla and Pipavav
-$270.22/mt CFR New Mangalore and Rozy
Further awards may be possible April 17 ahead of the expiry of the offers, but the significant pressure from the Chinese Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association to block its members from accepting netbacks in the $250s/mt FOB from China appears set to prevent more sales of Chinese material.
Should STC purchases be below 400,000 mt at the end, IPL is expected to float a tender early May, likely permitting loading through June 15.
India: Price-offers in STC tender tabulated
Price-offers have been opened in STC’s April 10 tender. MTPL offered lowest at $266/mt CFR for 360,000 mt firm, followed by Agri Commodities at $267.20/mt CFR for 125,000 mt firm. Global offered at $268.50/mt CFR for 150,000 mt firm.
Offers from Amber, Aries, Ameropa, Dreymoor, Fertisul, Mekatrade, Quantum, Sinochem and Keytrade were disqualified.
A total 2.8 million mt was offered firm and 625,000 mt option, but only the tender-conform offers are listed in the following:

s/o =at seller’s option Apt= As per tender
M=Mundra, K=Kandla, Kp= Krishnapatnam, V=Vizag, Kk=Kakinada,

ASIA AND OCEANIA
South Korea: Small import deals still at low numbers
The small tenders last week by Namhae and Chobi were reportedly booked in the upper $270s/mt CFR, still reflecting trader-beliefs of further deterioration in Chinese export values despite the Chinese Nitrogen Association's intervention pursuant to the low offers presented in the April 10 STC tender in India.
South Korean urea imports in March as identified by GTIS meanwhile jumped to 97,000 mt, up by 67% on the prior year. The entire quantity was imported from China. The March volume brought the total Q1 quantity to 234,000 mt, up by 23.4% on Q1 2014. China accounted for 229,000 mt of the total, an increase of 108% on the prior year.

China: CNIFA pressure to block low priced urea sales to STC mounts
The China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association continues to apply significant pressure on producers not to succumb to traders' calls for cover in the low to mid $250s/mt FOB for prilled urea. That level is assessed necessary for the traders to generate a margin on possible Indian sales basis the STC counter-bids at $266- 270.22/mt CFR pursuant to the Indian importer's April 10 tender. The efforts appear to have been successful to date.
Mainstream offers for prills for export are meanwhile being maintained by producers around the $265/mt FOB marker, but quotes for small parcels were also available at an even $260/mt FOB.
As was the case last week, prices have been slipping further in the domestic market this week, but the netbacks to producers for prilled and granular urea are still significantly above those perceived in export deals. Mainstream offers in Shandong and the western part of Henan were down by about $8/mt equivalent to RMB 1,480-1,500/mt ($238-242/mt) EXW. The low end reflected an export value for the prills in the upper $270s/mt FOB.
Lower trades were reported in Ordos, Inner Mongolia where a producer conceded sales down to RMB 1,360/mt EXW, but the higher inland transportation costs rendered the export value of those trades largely in line with the numbers calculated for material originating from Shandong and Henan.
To compare, the counters from STC at the $266/mt CFR base price for fast East Coast India ports are estimated to provide producers with netbacks around $252/mt FOB after allowing for freight around $9/mt, direct transaction costs of $2/mt plus extra financing related to the revised STC payment/reimbursement clause that will delay payment, and a limited margin to an intermediary.
Applying inland transportation charges at an average of RMB 120/mt and throughput charges at key ports such as Yantai around RMB 75/mt, the $252/mt FOB would yield a producer a netback around an even RMB 1,300/mt EXW, at best.
A domestic/export value-spread was also evident in granular urea where repeat domestic deals were suggested at RMB 1,550-1,570/mt ($250-253/mt) FCA in Shanxi. These reflected export values for granular above $290/mt FOB. Offers for the premium grade for export are nevertheless still cited around $275/mt FOB.
Inventories are assessed in line with last week, with about 900,000 mt combined of prilled and granular urea available for prompt shipment from key ports.
NITRATES & SULPHATES
ANALYSIS
Quiet week across nitrates with little price movement
UAN
Trade in UAN was reported fairly slow this week. In France few new prompt UAN-30 sales were fixed at €228-230/mt FCA owing to limited demand as farmers use up existing stocks.
Abu Qir will try again to sell 25,000 mt UAN-32 as it closes a new tender April 21 for prompt loading. This follows a sale of just 4,000 to Ameropa marginally below $210/mt FOB last week. The supplier is likely to encounter similar difficulties in selling this latest cargo given most buyers have previously secured tonnes required for the current application season in Europe. Potential sales to the US also would require a lower price tag given recent offers around $255/mt CFR and bids below $250/mt CFR for the Atlantic Coast.
Ammonium Sulphate
The AS market is lacklustre owing to an industry conference taking place in Beijing, China this week. Chinese suppliers continue to seek values of $128-129/mt FOB for caprolactam grade product.
GrodnoAzot issued an export tender for 25,000 mt AS closing April 17 for April/May shipment. The supplier is targeting sales higher than $150/mt FOB.
Ammonium Nitrate/CAN
Further substantial reductions in netbacks to FSU suppliers of AN did materialize as expected via activity in Latin America over recent days, and producers are now faced with bids no higher than $215/m t FOB for residual business.
The US AN market remains disappointing, with too much supply being offered in a market that appears to have lower demand compared to prior years.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
US New Orleans: AN barge supply still exceeds demand
The surge in spring fertilizer applications inland has provided more guidance to the marketplace about potential ammonium nitrate demand, and so far the anecdotal reports are not positive for suppliers. Indications this week were that AN barges could be purchased at $290-295/st FOB New Orleans, down $5-
10/st from prior weeks. While demand is marginally reduced in the domestic market, according to distributors, most traders point to oversupply as the culprit for declining values.
US Atlantic Coast: Quotes for UAN under more pressure
Part cargos of UAN-32 have sold at $258/mt CFR in recent days and offers from importers are down to
$255/mt CFR. Meanwhile, potential buyers' bids are below $250/mt CFR. While demand for UAN likely will meet prior expectations, buyers from the farm level all the way through to producers and importers expect values to fall substantially due to the same bearish price concerns for crops that have hurt other fertilizer prices.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Russia: AN netbacks dip below $220/mt FOB
The April 10 Incofe tender for 10,000 mt AN that was awarded to EuroChem is estimated to have been booked by the producer at a netback below $220/mt FOB from the Baltic. The Baltic and Black Sea Price- points have been adjusted accordingly. The cargo will ship in combination with urea to Colombia, Honduras and Costa Rica.
Brazil: AS imports steady for March
Brazilian AS imports for March 2015 reached 171,484 mt, virtually unchanged from the previous year, according to ANDA data.
In the first two months of this year demand for AS grew substantially in line with a satisfactory outlook for the Safrinha crop and growing overall demand for the fertilizer.
AS prices have changed little over recent months and are currently pegged around $160/mt CFR for caprolactam grade product. Brazilian enquiries for AS are expected to increase from May for the summer application season:

Central America: EuroChem books Incofe tender and CHS books Mayafert
The April 10 Incofe tender for 20,000 mt prilled urea and 5,000 mt granular urea in combination with 10,000 mt AN was awarded to EuroChem for all products that are to be loaded by May 15. The prilled urea wil be shipped to Cortes/Honduras (15,000 mt) and Santo Tomas/Guatemala while the granular urea will load for Limon/Costa Rica.
The 10,000 mt AN will be split between Cortes (6,000 mt) and Santo Tomas (4,000 mt). Mayafert was linked to a purchase of a full cargo of granular urea of Middle East origin from CHS. Exact details on pricing in the transactions have not been released.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Belarus: GrodnoAzot issues another AS tender
GrodnoAzot said it issued an export tender for 25,000 mt AS closing April 17 for April/May shipment. The supplier is targeting sales higher than $150/mt FOB.
Its previous tender for the same quantity closed on March 24. The volumes were eventually sold to neighbouring markets and domestic customers.
EUROPE
Turkey: No update from Igsas
No updates were available after Igsas closed an import tender for 5,000 mt caprolactam grade AS April 10, but suggestions are that the session was scrapped.
France: Limited demand as most product already secured
The French UAN-30 market is quiet with most prompt tonnes required already secured. The limited quantity sold is still priced at €228-230/mt FCA. Scarce interest is noted this week in forward tonnes.
Demand is expected to increase in the coming weeks as corn sowing has already got under way.

Abu Qir issued a sales tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32 closing April 21 for April 25-28 lifting.
Last week the supplier managed to sell just 4,000 mt marginally below $210/mt FOB to Ameropa for prompt lifting to Spain under its April 7 re-tender.

Fears of a double dip in ammonia values west of Suez
A marginal uptick in spot activity is noted west of Suez but not enough to edge prices upwards. If anything, Black Sea values remain under considerable downwards pressure owing to ample supply and weak demand.
Fears of a double dip in Yuzhnny values are a real concern expressed by several suppliers. OCP is already claiming procurement of Black Sea tonnage at netbacks on recent concluded business below $390/mt FOB although this has been refuted by producers and traders in the region.
Koch and Trammo are otherwise keeping the market alive with the latter securing another 15,000 mt from NF Trading at around $400/mt FOB Yuzhnny for late April lifting. Speculation concerning the destination of Koch’s 40,000 mt Clipper Neptun cargo which peaked participants’ interest last week gave way to the news April 14 that the vessel is indeed headed for Taft/USA as had originally been scheduled. Koch is now reported to be seeking a similar volume for late May lifting possibly to be used against contract commitments in the East with OPZ approached to supply a part cargo.
Not satisfied with recent cargoes from both Yuzhnny and the Baltic, Koch has also directed the Jenny N to load a full 40,000 mt from Sorfert Algeria at the end of April. It is unclear whether the lifting relates to a new spot deal or an execution of a purchase concluded in October 2014 which has not yet been picked up.
Further adding to possible fears of oversupply and falling prices came with the news this week that owing to a shutdown of its Trinidad urea facility, PCS had three additional ammonia cargoes on offer for prompt lifting. Yara has already snapped 15,000 mt up for shipment to the US at prevailing market values while PCS was heard to offering cargoes to potential buyers in Europe at press time.
PotashCorp's decision to export more ammonia from Trinidad comes at a poor time for suppliers given upcoming negotiations between Yara and Mosaic regarding May pricing for tons to Tampa. The phosphate producer already was arguing that falling phosphate values should stem any further increase, as seen for April Tampa prices.
With ammonia application work accelerating in inland US, time is closing in on whether urea will steal any market share from ammonia for side-dress applications later this spring for corn. At press time, inland urea
values had gained modestly compared to prior weeks, suggesting the potential greater demand for urea was being felt in the marketplace. Higher urea prices naturally will reduce buyers' motivation to switch sources of nitrogen.
East of Suez interest in ammonia is almost inexistent. Middle Eastern suppliers are reported offering up to two additional cargoes for May lifting but so far no news deals are reported concluded. Indian ammonia plant turnarounds continue to keep a lid on demand while Far Eastern consumers have rejected various spot offers in expectation of further price falls, possibly to the level of $450/mt CFR.
Highlights of the week:
∙Trammo buys 15,000 mt from NF around $400/mt FOB
∙Koch’s Clipper Neptun to head for Taft/USA
∙Koch looking for more Yuzhnny cargo for May lifting
∙OCI picks up 15,000 mt Baltic ammonia for own Rotterdam facility
∙Trammo sells small parcel to Igsas at $430/mt CFR with credit
∙OCP claims Black Sea ammonia secured below $390/mt FOB netbacks
∙Koch’s Jenny N directed to Algeria to load Sorfert cargo
∙PCS sells spot cargo ex-Trinidad to Yara, two other cargoes available
∙East of Suez very quiet
Short term outlook
Yet again producers west of Suez fear another dip in prices in the coming weeks as demand remains poor and supply ample.
Ammonia versus DAP
OCP is granulating at full capacity this month and whereas much of the production is for lower analysis products, the N content is the same or higher than standard DAP or MAP. As such demand for ammonia through April at least should be good. The outlook for May will depend on when the Brazilian season gets under way. If delayed into May, OCP has indicated that it will ship incerased quantities of phosacid into India instead, thereby reducing its potential demand for ammonia accordingly.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices reached $1,680-1,700/mt CFR China this week. Prices are expected to gain further support after benzene prices surged following an explosion at the Dragon Aromatics plant in China.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Pre-plant applications moving fast
Warmer, dryer weather has enabled retailers to make substantial progress in ammonia applications over the last week. As a result retailers are trying to come to grips with how much ammonia they will need for subsequent side-dress demand once corn emerges in the region. Urea was a better buy on paper in prior weeks, but a jump in pricing for that product this week reflects in part the possibility that some retailers were likely to buy more to substitute for ammonia. If the bump in urea values continues and ammonia pricing softens at all, there ultimately will be little switching between ammonia to urea this season. Ammonia postings are as high as $630/st FOB in some places, but cheaper values are cited west of the Mississippi River.
US Gulf: Spot ammonia cargo bought by Yara
Yara has bought 15-20,000 mt of ammonia from PotashCorp that will be lifted for the US Gulf likely by the end of the month. However, the price tag for the transaction was not available at press time, with market sources suggesting only that it likely was in line with the current market.
PotashCorp has additional spot ammonia to add to the US Gulf and other enduser markets in April and possibly forward as it idled its urea train in Trinidad and Tobago in favor of selling ammonia. The latter product currently is more profitable. Furthermore, a natural gas supply curtailment planned this month for that country will cut into all nitrogen production.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Trinidad and Tobago: PotashCorp adds to NH3 export availability
PotashCorp has idled its granular urea unit, the only such plant in Trinidad and Tobago, starting this month in favor of selling more ammonia into the export market. The driver behind the decision is the plunging value of urea versus ammonia globally. The move could free up as much as 37,000 mt/month of ammonia for export, but this assumes gas supplies allowed the ammonia plants to run at capacity in Trinidad and Tobago, a rare event.
The move coincides with reduced gas availability in Trinidad and Tobago for all nitrogen producers due to the ongoing work to improve logistics and bring new offshore gas platforms on line. The National Gas Co. has indicated an 11-day curtailment at about a 15% rate starting this week, but indications from the gas distributor historically have been optimistic. Therefore, sources at PotashCorp were not willing to predict how long the urea unit would be down.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic Sea: OCI loads Navigator Galaxy cargo
OCI is linked to the purchase of a 15,000 mt spot cargo out of Sillamae this week which was loaded on the Navigator Galaxy bound for OCI’s own system in Rotterdam. No further details were known at press time.
Black Sea: Spot activity picks up on NF sale
Trammo has secured 15,000 mt Black Sea ammonia from NF Trading this week at $400-410/mt FOB. The cargo will be lifted April 27-30 on the Marycam Swan likely for Turkey/Israel.
The vessel has just finished loading a return 14,000 mt swap cargo from Ameropa, topped off by a small spot parcel from the supplier priced around $400/mt FOB April 14 and is now on her way to Aliaga, Turkey to be used against previous Trammo commitments.
Koch is reported once again seeking up to 40,000 mt Black Sea ammonia for loading in late May and has approached OPZ for a part cargo. There is speculation that once secured these volumes are will be placed in the Far East.
This follows reports that OPZ is in discussions with an unnamed trader for the spot sale of 23,000 mt for April/May shipment.
Koch’s Clipper Neptun is scheduled to arrive in Yuzhnny April 17 after securing tonnage from OPZ late March. The vessel is now understood to be headed for Taft/USA after completion of loading.
It is uncertain whether OPZ will begin selling some of its ammonia and urea via electronic auctions by late April as has been widely reported.
Shipments and fully firm nominations for April are now above 310,000 mt:

Belgium: BASF focuses on contracts
BASF is focusing on contract deliveries from Ameropa at present despite approaches by several suppliers keen to sell spot cargoes.
Turkey: Igsas buys more ammonia
It emerged this week that Trammo recently sold 6-7,000 mt to Igsas around $430/mt CFR. The deal was likely concluded with a minimum of 180 days credit, suggesting cost of finance of about $6/mt.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: Spot cargoes available for May lifting
Middle Eastern producers are reported offering spot cargoes for May lifting but no new business had
been concluded at press time. Prices remain indicatively assessed as low as $380/mt FOB on weak demand from India and the Far East.
Morocco: Ammonia imports still steady
OCP continues to import ammonia cargoes claiming recent business has been concluded at $420-430/mt CFR. This has not been confirmed by Black Sea sellers.
OCP’s recently fixed OPZ cargo to be loaded on the Gaschem Stade is rumoured to be a semi-
permenant deal with the option to extend the arrangement after an initial three months. The vessel will arrive in Morocco in the first half of May.
Algeria: Koch's Jenny N heads for Arzew
Koch’s Jenny N is headed to Algeria to load 40,000 mt at the end of April following a spot purchase. It is unclear whether this a new transaction or a belated loading of the 40,000 mt secured by Koch from Sorfert in October last year which it has not yet picked up.
Sorfert will load up to 70,000 mt in April against previous commitments.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Prices stable but could fall further
Indian ammonia values remain at $420-440/mt CFR amid limited demand and plant turnarounds. Downwards pressure is still being applied to prices by buyers who are keen to see prices fall by another $20/mt:
Ammonia imports into India for April so far total almost 64,000 mt:

ASIA AND OCEANIA
South Korea: SFC not booking Koch cargo yet
SFC said it remains in discussions with Koch over a contract delivery of 20-30,000 mt for June/July delivery. It ruled itself out as a buyer of Koch cargo off the Clipper Neptun due to load 40,000 mt in Yuzhnny April 17. That vessel is now reported headed for Taft/USA.
SFC is reluctant to secure contract tonnage from Koch at present owing to cheaper product on offer from the Middle East. The buyer was approached by several suppliers this week to gauge interest in May spot cargoes around 10,000 mt, with offers rumoured as low as $450/mt CFR.
The buyer will receive 10,000 mt ex-Indonesia contract tonnes from Trammo at the end of April off the Brussels followed by 23,000 mt from Sabic mid-May.
PHOSPHATES
ANALYSIS
Crop prices yet again take their toll on fertilizer demand with the US market the latest to be affected
US domestic demand appears set to take a substantial hit this spring, as market sources throughout the supply chain report farmers will cut application rates in the key growing areas by around 20% per acre due to low crop values versus fertilizer input costs.
Until recently suppliers had hoped that contract requirements to maintain specified levels of fertility on rented ground would help support demand, but reports to Fertilizer Week are that renters and landowners have agreed that sticking to normal application rates will simply produce losses for renters. The bad news for suppliers comes even as seasonal demand emerges in the US Midwest and Southern Plains. While this has been supportive of current pricing, the supply chain is well stocked according to distributors. Expectations are that cheaper input costs next year will allow US farmers to return to historical application rates. However, there are no confirmed reports of fill pricing from Mosaic for the summer.
Elsewhere the market has been seasonally quiet with many of the major players in China this week. Indian importers are taking a breather having lined up sufficient tonnes to cover immediate requirements and build up a buffer stock ahead of the season. They are also awaiting final confirmation of the NBS rates, which although are expected to remain largely unchanged, will need to be confirmed to give real clarity on pricing.
Chinese producers meanwhile are relaxed with a solid quantity of export business on the books for the major producers in India and some curtailments as a result of planned maintenance. As such they are holding firm on price in the range of $460-470/mt FOB with many still citing numbers at the mid-upper end of this range. Buyers are quoting lower numbers and rumours have been circulating that sales in the mid $470s/mt CFR India have been concluded however there is no firm evidence as yet to back up these
reports. Nevetheless buyers are putting pressure on Chinese suppliers to reduce prices below $480/mt CFR for the next round of import purchasing. If values for non-Chinese product hold in the mid $480s/mt CFR for India, then US exports also will be competitive in that market.
In Brazil the import campaign is yet to start. However the freefall in price indications seen in recent weeks appears to have been halted with Russian producers said to be offering at higher levels for May. Mosaic meanwhile has dropped its export price down to $460-463/mt FOB which although moving in the right direction is still equating to a CFR level well above current indications from Brazilian buyers. Current in Brazil prices remain unsupported by any real volumes but perhaps a floor, albeit temporary, has been found.
Highlights of the Week
∙Mosaic drops its price to $460-463/mt FOB Tampa
∙Rollover in NW European phosphoric acid contracts for Q2
∙Rumours of lower prices in India but no firm confirmation
∙NBS rates yet to be announced
∙Chinese prices remain in range of $460-470/mt FOB
∙Bangladesh to issue tender for private sector import of DAP and TSP
Short Term Outlook
The market is likely to remain quiet through to May and even mid-May by which time most producers will have completed their respective turnarounds. Although the market will remain weak until then, it will stabilise as the key importers return to the marketplace such as India, Pakistan, Brazil, Bangladesh and Turkey. The import prospects for India and Pakistan are looking positive, given a normal monsoon, while the longer the Brazilians delay, the shorter the import window and the more condensed it will become. As such the market could get quite interesting by June particularlry as two major Chinese producers are foregoing MAP production and concentrating their efforts on DAP only. The potential downside risk could come from increased production in Morocco as OCP ramps up JPH-1, but OCP has proved that it will curtail production if demand warrants such a move.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Export benchmark moves down
The Tampa benchmark fell by as much as $10/mt this week with a sale by Mosaic of 15,000 mt of DAP sold to Latin America at $460-463/mt FOB for May shipment. In the meantime, rumors of possible sales of DAP cargos to India continued. The decline in US Gulf Q2 liquid sulphur costs likely making that market more attractive over the summer. It also reduces the likelihood of market related curtailments. However, some traders believe Mosaic may consider such a move depending on upcoming MAP pricing for Brazil and elsewhere.
US Midwest: DAP moving, but demand expectations lower
Expectations about spring demand for DAP and MAP have been replaced by reports of deliveries of previously ordered material and new spot sales.
While phosphates are moving, distributors say it has become apparent that farmers are cutting phosphate application rates, even on rented ground. Landowners understand that renters will lose money if fertility requirements in contracts are enforced to the letter this year, given current input costs, land rents and new crop pricing. Anecdotal reports expect demand in the Midwest region to be off by around 20% compared to the prior year, although much of that decline will be due to fewer corn acres in the region compared to last year. Prices for truck loads remain around $460/st FOB.
US New Orleans: Barge values flat with steady demand
Most DAP trades in the US barge market were cited around $410/st FOB this week for barges in the Gulf or prompt load dates.
Barges up the river traded at higher values, with Cairo Illinois and St. Louis Missouri business still cited around, $415-$420/st FOB, in line with last week. Reports of trades, bids and offers for MAP barges are across a range either with no premium to DAP to up to $5/st more expensive.
Buyers’ timidity in prior weeks and even in the current market is helping to support New Orleans prices in the near term, with endusers exhausting alternatives before committing to further barges. This has left sellers in a position of strength. However, inland buyers are buying only with this season in mind.
US: Export rate continued to gain through March
US DAP and MAP export volumes in March of this year were 169,111 st (153,416 mt) P2O5, up from 142,873 st (129,613 mt) P2O5, according to the latest producer data from The Fertilizer Institute.
This trend continued for much of the current fertilizer year that has seen US exports stay moderately ahead of July-March shipments in the previous year , at 1.59 million st (1.44 million mt) P2O5 this year versus 1.36 million st (1.24 million mt) P2O5 for 2013/14.
A comparison of export destinations between March of this year and March 2014 does not show a significant difference in destinations. Primary destinations for US DAP/MAP during March of this year included Brazil at 47,788 st P2O5, Mexico at 20,941 st P2O5 and Australia at 18,346 st P2O5.
For the first nine months of the current fertilizer year through March, US DAP/MAP exports were dominated by its historically key customers of Brazil at 340,551 st P2O5, India at 258,629 st P2O5 and Canada at 258,375 st P2O5.
Mexico: Fertinal committed through May
Fertinal is committed through May with shipments to South America and the domestic market.
With the Australian shipping programme now over, Fertinal has shifted its attention to markets closer to home until the Australian season resumes later in the year. As such it has just finished loading 33,000 mt DAP/MAP on the Orient Tide for Ameropa/Argentina and Uruguay, as reported previously. The tonnes were priced on a formula basis.
This will be followed by a 35-40,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP cargo for Chile loading late April and a second Latin American cargo is believed to be loading in May. In addition, Fertinal will be supplying the domestic market and on the basis of all these shipments, will therefore be fully committed through to June. Price levels remain unchanged in the $460s/470/mt FOB range. It is now discussing H1 June business.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Little change as buyers continue to take as needed
The market remains unchanged in terms of demand but prices have continued to weaken over the past couple of weeks.
Brazilian buyers are yet to really show their hand and return to the market in earnest for the main import season. There appears to be no rush and at least two major suppliers are prepared for further delays to the start of the import campaign. Price indications for MAP remain weak although there are signs that maybe a floor has, at least temporarily, been reached.
Following reports last week of Russian offers as low as $460/mt CFR, it would appear that these have now moved up with talk of $470/mt CFR being indicated for May. Again speculation over price is rife with price levels varying depending on whether traders are long or short and with a lack of volume sales to support any true price.
OCP has refrained from shipping any MAP this month but has sold around 100,000 mt NPS 12-46-0+7S to various buyers in the $470s/mt CFR for April shipment in four lots. This will be used both for blending as well as direct application and could displace some demand for 11-44-0 where the additional sulphur is needed.
Mosaic has dropped its price once again, this time indicating a price out of Tampa of $460-463/mt FOB equating to the upper $470s/480/mt CFR Brazil level , still above current indications from the buyers.
Chinese MAP producers are foregoing MAP where they can and producing DAP instead in order to take advantage of better netbacks in Asian markets. With two major producers, Hubei Yihua and Wengfu not producing any MAP grades at all for export this year, it will be interesting to see how this affects availability of these grades for the Brazilian market through the key import months.
Brazil: Q1 P2O5 consumption falls 13% year on year
Despite some improvement in March, Brazilian P2O5 consumption fell by 13% overall in Q1.
Latest ANDA data show that consumption of P2O5 in March fell by 3% against 2014 and although an improvement on January and February, overall sales in Q1 fell 13% year on year.
Nevertheless despite not reaching the record levels of 2014, Brazil consumed 44% and 48% more P2O5 in Q1 this year than it did in 2013 and 2012 respectively.
Brazil: P2O5 Consumption by Month (‘000 mt P2O5)
% change
Source: ANDA
Looking at import volumes there is a clear and sharp decline in the import quantity of almost all phosphate fertilizers, particularly MAP, in Q1 but only when compared with 2014. If we compare the volumes of MAP and DAP to 2013, imports this year were up by 19% and 15% respectively.
Average Q1 imports for the past three years, between 2011 and 2013, were 385,000 mt so this year's imports have been only marginally below this number.
This all reinforces the view that Q1 2014 was an anomaly prompted by higher crop prices, lower fertilizer prices (just $410-420/mt CFR Brazil when buyers first returned to the market) and greater confidence in the market arising from, amongst other factors, a more stable exchange rate. As reported previously in Fertilizer Week, this year Brazil has merely reverted to its normal seasonal buying patterns.
Brazil: Imports and Production (‘000 mt Product)
MAP Imports arrived in Q2 (‘000 mt product)
857 737
Taking all the available data, it becomes clear that availability in Brazil remains at manageable levels and comparable with last year, even accounting for the drop in consumption and a higher surplus at the end of 2014. As such, demand in Q2 should be relatively robust and even allowing for a less bouyant agricultural and economic backdrop, should translate into steady demand going forward.
Source: ANDA * excluding any surplus from previous years
CONAB has also released its monthly update projecteding total corn production at 79 million tonnes, with the full season crop seen at 30.3 million and safrinha 48.7 million. Although 10% of Mato Grosso safrinha planting in occurred outside the ideal planting window, conditions have been very good and encourage good crop growth. However, late April and early May will be the key yield determining period. CONAB has also raised its forecast for soyabean production to 94.3 million tonnes, exceeding the previous record by over 5 million tonnes.
Venezuela: NPK imports reach record high in 2014
Venezuela imported 605,000 mt NPKs in calendar year 2014, a 45% increase on the previous year and the third consecutive year of record imports, according to GTIS data.
During 2014, Venezuela imported 310,000 mt from Russia, almost double the volume supplied in 2013, with a further 144,000 mt shipped from Poland's Police plant. Meanwhile, the volume of imported NPKs from Colombia into Venezuela has been growing steadily over the past five years, up from less than 5,000 mt in 2009, to almost 125,000 mt in 2014.
EUROPE
Bulgaria: Iran emerges as Agropolichim's TSP primary market
Latest GTIS data for January show Agropolichim export 31,500 mt TSP to Iran that month. There were no other exports of TSP, DAP or MAP in January.
Bulgarian TSP exports reached a high of 226,000 mt in 2014 of which 157,000 mt were shipped to Iran, almost 70% of all Agropolichim's export availability. The balance was delivered into West Europe with 24,000 mt each to Belgium and France and small lots to other West European markets.
With more emphasis being given to TSP, export availability of MAP was lower in 2014 while DAP remained unchanged from the previous year. Just 20,000 mt MAP were exported last year in small lots to Romania, Hungary and Austria. Of the DAP, 42,000 mt went into Romania although some of this may have been transported further into Europe.
Bulgaria: Syrian rock imports continue at a steady pace.
Agropolichim imported 25,000 mt Jordanian rock in January this year according to the latest GTIS data, along with a further 9,000 mt from Syria.
For calendar year 2014, phosphate rock imports reached a high of 578,000 mt comprising 231,000 mt from Syria, 216,000 mt from Morocco and 130,000 mt from Jordan. Syrian deliveries have remained at an average of 222,000 mt per year since 2012 but in the two previous years, the volume was well over 300,000 mt. The quantity from Morocco jumped last year, mainly displacing tonnage from Jordan.
Poland: More rock arriving from Senegal
Poland imported 100,000 mt phosphate rock in January this year, according to the latest GTIS data.
Cargoes came in from Morocco, Algeria, Senegal and a further 10,000 mt from Israel.
Volumes from Grupa Azoty's own reserves in Senegal have been increasing slowly but steadily since 2013. In calendar year 2014, a total of 220,000 mt Senegalese rock were shipped to Szczecin of which 150,000 mt were shipped in H2.
Overall imports in 2014 from all sources reached 1,266 million mt with Algeria supplying 564,000 mt or 45% of the total. Additional quantities came in from Morocco, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Togo, Turkey and Israel.
Poland: Further growth in NPK exports to Venezuela
GTIS data for January show 15,000 mt Polish DAP delivered into Germany.
Just 52,000 mt DAP were exported in 2014 which although a higher volume than in 2013, was still considerably lower than in previous years. Police has continued to place greater emphasis on the production of NPs and NPKs.
In January Police exported 49,000 mt NPKs including 20,000 mt for Venezuela and 11,000 mt for Denmark. Total exports in calendar year 2014 reached 346,000 mt, in line with the average since 2009. Of this quantity more than 40% was shipped to Venezuela, a market that has been steadily growing in importance for Poland over the past five years. Interestingly there were no exports to African markets in 2014, one of the reasons probably being the presence since last year of Moroccan NPKs in this region.
Poland exported no NPs in January. NP exports in 2014 reached 43,000 mt, largely split between Paraguay and Argentina.
Turkey: DAP tender scrapped and negotiations continue
Igsas scrapped its tender of April 10 for 10,000 mt DAP.
Gubretas continues to negotiate its annual phosphate requirement with GCT/Tunisia. An agreement is expected shortly.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP well committed through April
OCP is well committed through April but with limited DAP and MAP shipments.
OCP remains well committed through April and into early May with shipments to Africa, Europe and
Brazil. However, no DAP, MAP or TSP will be shipped to Brazil this month, instead OCP will ship 100,000 mt NPS 12-46-0+7S in four shipments sold in the mid $470s/mt CFR to various importers including Heringer. The product will be used both in blending and for direct application. OCP has indicated that it is not interested in the recent low prices seen in Brazil for MAP and if solid demand is still not evident in May, it will ship further quantities of phosacid into India.
Looking at the rest of the April line-up, as reported previously in Fertilizer Week, OCP will also load the balance of its Ethiopian cargoes, a total of 150,000 mt in three lots. The first has already loaded, the second will load shortly and the third will load at the end of the month/early May.
In addition it will load close to 100,000 mt DAP/MAP/NPKs to other African markets including 16,000 mt DAP to Mali/Senegal, 5,000 mt to the Ivory Coast, 6,000 mt MAP to Algeria, and 25,000 mt DAP/MAP to South Africa (mainly DAP). Additional NPKs will be delivered into Nigeria.
Just 25-30,000 mt DAP will have been delivered into Europe in April, sold between $510-515/mt FOB Jorf Lasfar including sales to Fertiberia/Spain.
OCP will also load two lots of MAP, one 6,000 mt parcel for Italy sold at a premium to DAP for non-fertilizer use, and the second cargo comprising 8,000 mt high grade MAP for Mexico.
The domestic market will take 25-30,000 mt DAP and NPKs in April. Morocco has raised its wheat import duty to 75% to help protect the local cereal crop, which is expected to see a bumper harvest of 10 million tonnes (6.7 million in 2014).
This all equates to around 360,000 mt DAP in product tonnes equivalent when calculated on a P2O5
basis. OCP has total granulation capacity of nearer 500,000 mt DAP per month but only if phosphoric acid is diverted from export use. Otherwise when phosacid exports are back up to the normal (higher levels i.e. this month) it is nearer 350,000 mt.
In addition to this, OCP will ship 110-120,000 mt P2O5 phosphoric acid to India, around 15,000 mt to Saudi Arabia and, regular quantities to Brazil and Europe and the normal 30-35,000 mt P2O5 to Pakistan from the Pak-Maroc joint venture plant.
NW Europe: Rollover agreed for Q2 phosphoric acid contracts
A rollover has been agreed for Q2 phosphoric acid contracts in NW Europe.
An agreement was reached last week between OCP and its customers in NW Europe for the Q1 price for phosphoric acid to be rolled over into Q2. As such the price range for CFR NW Europe will remain unchanged at $900-990/mt P2O5 CFR NW Europe for shipments up to and including June. Some Moroccan contracts were agreed at slightly higher prices but the overall range remains unchanged. Phosacid from non- Moroccan sources remains at the more competitive end of the price range while the upper end of the price range represents a higher grade Moroccan acid to customers taking smaller quantities.
Tunisia: Severe curtailments again hit phosphate rock production
Yet again production of phosphate rock in Tunisia has been severely curtailed by sit-ins and local unrest.
For the second consecutive week, production and/or transport of rock has been halted at most of the major mines in the Gafsa region, including Redayef, Oum Larayes , Metaloui , Kef Eddour and Kef
Chefayer. According to local press reports, only the mine and beneficiation facilities at M'dhilla are currently operating. Unemployed protesters have been organising sit-ins at a number of the mines as well as the railway stations at Redayef and Oum Larayes while also blocking water supplies to the mines.
Rail transport is however operating between Metaloui and Mdhilla to feed the downstream plants at Gabes, M'dhilla and La Skhira (including Tifert). Private truck companies are also being used to transport the rock to the plants to meet ongoing off-shore commitments.
As a result of the problems, rock production is reported to have fallen to an estimated 15% capacity.
According to a statement made to the press by the director general of the CPG (Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa), Q1 production of phosphate rock failed to meet its original target of 1.56 million mt. Instead output
fell almost 40% against Q1 2014, to just 604,000 mt in the first three months of this year compared with 983,000 mt last year.
It was only recently that the new government had announced that it had made the phosphate industry in Gafsa one of its priorities for its first 100 days of office, as reported by Fertilizer Week April 2. It had laid out plans for the production of rock to reach 500,000 mt per month in March, April and May but clearly this volume will not be reached in March/April. Officials have stated that continued efforts are being made to find solutions to "this very difficult situation".This included setting out a new set of measures at a high level meeting on April 13 to re-examine the cause of the problems, conducting an audit on the management approach of CPG and its subsidiaries to ensure "good governance", sending a government delagation to the region to address the problems first hand and dedicating a in Inner Cabinet meeting to the situation in May.

India: Market quiet and rumours abound
As most of the traders and importers gather in China this week, rumours of cargoes being traded at lower prices, in the mid $470s/mt have been circulating.
So far there is little evidence backing up these reports and even a number of the major buyers are refuting these rumours. Although prices for Chinese tonnage may fall below the $480/mt CFR level, they are not expected to fall dramatically. Chinese suppliers are holding firm to current prices in the range of $460-470/mt FOB and show no intention to drop prices further in the near future. Indian CFR prices at or around $480/mt equates back to the mid/upper $460s excluding any trader's margin.
A delegation from PhosAgro visited India last week and further DAP/NPK cargoes are said to have been sold in addition to the NPK cargoes previously sold to Deepak and IPL and the DAP cargo to IFFCO; the DAP in these cargoes was priced in the mid $480s/mt CFR. Further details on the new business have not yet been confirmed and may not be until the NBS rates are formally announced.
Uttar Pradesh Co-op is expected to issue a re-tender for 100,000 mt DAP. Hudson was awarded the full quantity from the original tender at $478/mt CFR held in January but failed to deliver.
RCF has still not awarded any tonnage against its DAP tender of March 16 for 65,000 mt and it is widely thought that this tender will be scrapped.
The NBS rates have not yet been announced. Whereas last year they were announced at the beginning of April, in 2013 the announcement was not made until May 2.
Just over 1 million mt DAP has been confirmed to date, excluding new business from Russia. An estimated
2.4million mt DAP in the form of MoU agreements has been agreed to date between Saudi, Jordanian and Chinese suppliers and the major buyers for the current fertilizer year.
The latest port data information is as follows:


India: Slow rate of Indian phosacid imports this month
Indian phosphoric acid imports appear to be relatively light so far this month.
A combination of higher prices, turnarounds and the delay in the announcement of the NBS rates appear to have caused phosphoric acid rates to slow down this month. However, with OCP planning to ship 110- 120,000 mt P2O5 in April and again in May to India, arrivals should soon start to pick up.
India: Q2 Rock contracts yet to get started
Negotiations are yet to start for Q2 phosphate rock contracts in India and may not until the NBS rates are formally announced giving clarity on the subsidy and market prices going forward.
Suppliers will be pushing for an increase in the wake of the $40/mt P2O5 hike in phosphoric acid prices for H1. Buyers will be citing the weak DAP market. DAP production in India via the phosphate rock and sulphur route remains the most attractive option, particularly given the lower sulphur prices. If buyers achieve a good price for Q2 rock which maintains this advantage, we can expect a robust level of imports going forward.
Imports to date for this calendar year stand at 2.31 million mt,a little less than this time last year. Imports for the full four months between January-April totalled 2.8 million mt with 837,000 mt arriving in April alone.

India: MMTC issues new DAP tender
MMTC issued a DAP tender for 30,000 mt black or dark brown DAP (18-46-0) +/- 10%, closing 1400 hrs in New Delhi on April 23 for prompt shipment to Mundra, Vizag or Kakinada. Both technical and price offers will be opened on April 23. Offers to be remain valid for 15 days.
Bangladesh: Tender to be issued for private sector DAP/TSP requirement
The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to issue a tender to determine the supply of the forthcoming crop year's DAP and TSP import requirement via the private sector.
A total of 400,000 mt DAP and 200,000 mt TSP may be imported through private sector companies in 2015/16 and a tender to this effect is expected to be announced shortly, to close end April/early May.
This quantity is below the quotas given to the private sector last year for 2014/15 of 460,000 mt DAP and 250,000 mt TSP. Against this quantity 220,000 mt DAP were supplied from China and 136,000 mt DAP from Australia. China used to be a major supplier of TSP to Bangladesh, shipping 400,000 mt in 2009, but since 2012 there have been no imports of Chinese TSP due to alledged quality issues.
In calendar year 2014, against the long standing government-government agreement, BADC (Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation) imported an additional 150,000 mt DAP and 190,000 mt TSP from OCP/Morocco and 300,000 mt TSP from GCT/Tunisia according to GTIS and IFA data. A similar quantity will be allocated to the public sector again for 2015/16. OCP has been shipping more TSP in Q1 to Bangladesh due to supply issues from Tunisia.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Producers aim to hold firm on price
As much of the industry gathers in China this week, the main topic is the Chinese DAP price going forward.
Chinese producers are holding firm on the DAP price in the range of $460-470/mt FOB. There have been rumours of sales concluded in the mid $470s/mt CFR India but as yet no firm evidence to back them
up. Indian buyers are putting pressure on the Chinese to drop the price below $480/mt CFR, a price which gives a netback in the mid-high $460s/mt FOB China excluding traders' margin. Hubei producers generally have a freight advantage but producers like YUC are not only selling direct but also ship panamax vessels, again giving a more attractive netback.
As Indian demand slows down following the rush of buying seen in recent weeks, Chinese producers are taking advantage of the quieter period to undertake annual maintenance. Both YUC and Kailin are taking rolling turnarounds through April and into May which will reduce overall production by around 25-
30%.Wengfu started its month long maintenance programme this week, taking each of its two phosphoric acid units down at a time, thereby reducing overall production by 50%.
As reported previously in Fertilizer Week, both Wengfu and Hubei Yihua are now focusing almost exclusively on DAP, foregoing production of all grades of MAP in favour of DAP, and in the case of Wengfu, purified phosphoric acid or PPA. Having not sold any DAP into India at all in 2014, Wengfu will be looking to establish a presence in this all important market this year and already we have seen it sell three cargoes to CIL with a fourth on offer, at competitive prices relative to other suppliers.
Most producers are bypassing granular MAP for export due to the low netbacks currently being seen in the Brazilian market as the return on DAP remains significantly higher. Even at $470/mt CFR Brazil for granular 11-52-0, the netback would be close to $440/mt FOB China, well below the equivalent netback for DAP in India and more costly to produce.
It remains to be seen how the absence of two of the major producers will affect availability of MAP once the Brazilian season gets under way in earnest. Certainly prices will have to improve to prompt other producers, with the flexibility to switch between products, to move away from DAP and back to MAP especially as Indian DAP demand is forecast to see a solid improvement on 2014.
The issue of VAT has once again come to the fore. Latest speculation suggests that the government will re- introduce VAT on fertilizer sales from September this year at a rate of 13%. Producers will be able to offset VAT already paid on raw materials and other inputs against this rate. As such, CRU estimates that the VAT will mean that producers are looking at an additional cost of between RMB 50-100/mt on the cost of producing DAP.
The National Bureau of Statistics sees rice plantings in China expanding 1.2% this year, with corn up 1.9%. This will help to boost domestic fertilizer demand.
POTASH
ANALYSIS
Indian potash contract wait continues as Uralkali confirms Chinese volumes
Prices in the potash spot markets remain at stable lows with some further drops as the new Indian potash contract remains elusive, slowing suppliers' attempts to recover potash prices through Q2.
Uralkali signed its quantity agreement to China late April 10, announcing firm seaborne volumes of 850,000 mt to Sinochem, CNAMPGC and CNOOC. Canpotex recently concluded a 1.8 million mt firm agreement, BPC signed a firm 1.7 million mt and APC a firm 600,000 mt. All deals were done at $315/mt CFR.
With roughly 1.3 million mt of seaborne volumes sent by Uralkali to China in 2014, the 850,000 mt deal may be a signal that Uralkali could reduce its exports to China in 2015 following the loss of production from Solikamsk-2 late in 2014. Uralkali also tends to send 1.3 million mt to China by rail.
In addition, ICL may not be able to sign any H1 volumes contract with China as negotiations with striking workers at the Dead Sea Works at an impasse this week. Without production from the site ICL is unlikely to secure agreements. Strikes began in mid-February and ICL may already have foregone roughly 500,000 mt of production.
With more settlements of the 2015 potash contracts, Chinese domestic prices keep sliding further towards the new price. Port wholesale prices are down by RMB 100/mt ($16/mt) already, compared to the prices before the first contract settlement on March 19. This week mainstream port wholesale prices for Russian red standard MOP on the whole remain stable at RMB 2,050/mt ($330/mt) FCA, while the low end has dropped to RMB 2,030/mt ($327/mt) FCA.
In addition, QSL slashed its potash prices by an average of RMB 130/mt this week. Its price of standard crystal MOP is now RMB 2,000/mt ($323/mt) CPT while its price for standard powdered MOP is RMB 1,960/mt ($316/mt) CPT.
Brazilian prices remain at the very weak level of $325-345/mt CFR this week with stiff competition, limited buyer interest and high supply levels holding down the price. The low end of prices is only $10/mt above the new Chinese contract price. Many suppliers say they are not offering below $335/mt CFR and still hope that they can begin moving the price back up towards the $350/mt CFR level with sales expected to build up in the coming months.
Europe remains at a similar weak level to Brazil with granular prices still at €300-310/mt CIF as suppliers struggle to achieve deals at €315/mt CIF. The top end of the current range represents only $333/mt at current exchange rates.
In the US, worries are building over demand in the Midwest due to low corn and soybean values in recent weeks. Reports have indicated that there could be as much as a 20% fall in potash application rates compared to last year. Despite this, US prices are unchanged at $340-350/st FOB New Orleans, $390-400/st FOB in the Midwest and $390-395/st FOB in the south, where demand has mostly been met.
In Southeast Asia, prices are seen stable at $315-345/mt CFR but most suppliers and distributers have moved prices in Malaysia towards $330/mt CFR level and there are indications that the low end of the region's price range will soon increase by $5-10/mt. Tender season builds up in May for Malaysia and a tender with H2 delivery for as much as 500,000 mt from Indonesia's Petrokimia Gresik has been announced. Suppliers will hope that Q2 will see some key price recoveries in Southeast Asia.
The new Indian contract price remains elusive with the Nutrient Based Subsidy still to be announced. Tenders in the country have again been pushed back due to the wait and India has continued to receive significant deliveries through April, giving buyers more negotiating power in the contract talks. It continues to be likely that an agreement will be made by the end of the month or into early May at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, roughly $330-337/mt CFR with 180 days credit but without an agreement suppliers continue to struggle to recover losses in the spot markets.

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly
affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.

MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
US Southern Plains: Demand mostly met
Potash applications still are underway in the South, but many distributors report they believe they have enough product in place or moving through the supply chain to meet their market's needs. Prices for granular product remains around $390-395/st FOB across the region.
US Midwest: Application rates may suffer more than expected
Granular potash prices have not moved lower this week, but distributors are increasingly concerned that demand will be well below expectations due to low corn and soybean values compared to prior years.
Similar reports have been heard for phosphates, with application rates for both products potentially falling around 20% compared to the prior year. Renters and landowners reportedly have put aside, or at least loosened fertility requirements for the current year as new crop prices will provide a loss to farmers given typical land rents.
Postings are as high as $410/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River, but most business appears to be getting done between $390-400/st FOB.
US New Orleans: Potash barges do not gain on inland demand
Traders report granular potash barges can be had at $340-350/st FOB New Orleans in general, but bids are entirely at the bottom end of the range. Some traders with barge positions are concerned they will have carry-over tons at the end of the season.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Prices still seen as low as $325/mt CFR
Brazilian prices remain at the weak level of $325-345/mt CFR this week with stiff competition, limited buyer interest and high supply levels holding down the price.
Brazilian prices seemed to have hit their floor at $335-345/mt CFR a few weeks ago following the Chinese contract agreement but high levels of competition have continued to force down the key spot price.
Brazilian prices have now fallen by roughly $40/mt in the first four months of 2015 and are seen at their lowest level since February 2014. In April 2014, Brazilian gMOP prices were $15-20/mt above the current level.
Currency depreciation and low agricultural prices have hit Brazilian farmers, who invested heavily last year. As a result, distributers and importers are defending their margins and resisting any price push at this point.
On the other hand, freight rates to Brazil have seen significant drops in the last year due to Brazilian real depreciation. In the last year Baltic-Brazil rates are down 27%, Vancouver-Brazil rates are down 36% and Ashdod-Brazil prices are down 40%, representing roughly a $10/mt saving in CFR sales for suppliers compared to last year.
Many suppliers say they are not offering below $335/mt CFR and still hope that they can begin moving the price back up towards the $350/mt CFR level with sales expected to build up in the coming months.
Brazil: March MOP imports fall by almost half
In March, Brazil imported 468,618 mt of potash, a 48% fall year on year as vessel arrivals fell well below the three-year average during Q1, according to ANDA data.
January imports fell 4.4% year on year and its February imports fell 33% compared to the same month a year earlier as the collapsing real and high levels of competition without a Chinese contract benchmark hit import levels.
In the first quarter, total MOP imports were down 32% year on year at 1.4 million mt. Total Q1 volumes going into Brazil were over 600,000 mt down on Q1 2014 but slightly above the Q1 2013 level.
Last year Brazil's imports increased 19% to 9.1 million mt compared to 2013 as demand increased substantially in the Latin American country. Early indications due to the weak import data are that surpassing the 2014 level is unlikely.
The line-up for fertilizer vessels seems to have jumped up in April, with the number of vessels due to arrive returning to its April level from 2014. Over 400,000 mt is believed to have been booked for arrival at the Antonina and Paranagua ports in April so far and it is likely that imports will now build towards a peak between July and October as in recent years:

Venezuela: NPK imports reach record high in 2014
Venezuela imported 605,000 mt NPKs in calendar year 2014, a 45% increase on the previous year and the third consecutive year of record imports, according to GTIS data.
During 2014, Venezuela imported 310,000 mt from Russia, almost double the volume supplied in 2013, with a further 144,000 mt shipped from Poland's Police plant.
Meanwhile, the volume of imported NPKs from Colombia into Venezuela has been growing steadily over the past five years, up from less than 5,000 mt in 2009, to almost 125,000 mt in 2014.
Chile: February potash exports fell almost 50%
SQM exported 40,629 mt of potash in February, a 49% fall on its February 2014 exports, according to GTIS data.
During the month, small volumes under 10,000 mt were sent to Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, China and Guatemala.
As a result, January and February's combined exports are down 14% compared to the same period in 2014, at 161,953 mt.
EUROPE
Europe: NPK suppliers hope for more activity after better weather
NPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months but with weather improving across the continent, some business is likely to build in the next few weeks.
Weak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks and apprehension on the farmers' buying side all impacted NPK demand in Q1 and even reduced prices failed to attract significant buyers.
Indications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively. Triple 15 offers are being made as low as $325/mt FOB, according to sources, but buyers are either disinterested or are bidding significantly lower.
Poland: Police exports 49,000 mt of NPKs in January
In January Zaklady Chemiczne Police exported 49,000 mt NPKs including 20,000 mt for Venezuela and 11,000 mt for Denmark.
Total exports in calendar year reached 346,000 mt, in line with the average since 2009. Of this quantity over 40% was shipped to Venezuela, a market that has been steadily growing in importance for Poland over the past five years. Interestingly there were no Polish exports to African markets in 2014, one of the reasons being the presence since last year of Moroccan NPKs in this region.
Poland exported no NPs in January. NP exports in 2014 reached 43,000 mt, largely split between Paraguay and Argentina.
Europe: Price remains stable in Europe
Colder weather across Europe at the start of 2015 and a late start to application has meant that suppliers continue to struggle in attempts to get granular potash prices above €310/mt CIF.
European granular prices remain in the €300-310/mt CIF range.
Suppliers hope that with indications around Europe of improved weather conditions, applications will build up and they can achieve their target prices.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Players await NBS and contract decision
The Indian Nutrient Based Subsidy rates were expected by this week but it seems they have again been pushed back, damaging chances of a new contract being reached by the end of the month.
RCF and NFL's potash tenders have both recently been pushed back until they hope an agreement is made while results from MMTC's tender, which is considered cover for the RCF tender, are unlikely to be announced until the RCF tender is completed.
Suppliers were last heard looking for at least a $20/mt increase on the current $322/mt with 180 days credit deal but buyers were pushing for a rollover. It is likely that the contract will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, at around $330-337/mt CFR with 180 days.
Representatives of BPC were in India on April 14-15 as part of an official trade visit with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. It is unclear whether discussions were made regarding the new potash contract but it is likely.
Q1 deliveries to India were very high and more than 200,000 mt of potash continued to enter the country in April, allowing some buyers to build stocks and strengthen their negotiating power in the contract talks.
As much as 54,224 mt of potash is due for arrival in the next week via two Canpotex shipments, to TCL and Mosaic, and one ICL delivery to Zuari.
Most buyers in India now expect that potash imports could hit a record five million mt in the fertilizer year 2015-16 but await clarification of the NBS rates, indications of the monsoon outlook and potash contract pricing before any firm forecasts. With 4.3 million mt likely to have been imported in the 2014-15 fertilizer year, the possible number would represent a strong 700,000 mt increase.

India: NFL extends 50,000 mt potash tender
India's National Fertilizers Ltd. extended the closing date on its tender for the import of 50,000 mt MOP.
The closing date has been moved to April 30 from April 13 most likely in the hope that a new Indian contract will be agreed before then. The H1 2014 contract price is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit and the new contract is likely to be signed by the end of April.
The tender is for H1 May delivery in two shipments of 25,000 mt across multiple Indian ports.
India: MFL awards potash tender to IPL
Indian fertilizer producer MFL has awarded its April 2 tender for 15,000 mt of potash to IPL.
MFL received two offers, one from IPL at $324/mt CFR and another from Uzagro at $330/mt CFR, both with 180 days credit.
Representatives in the country are currently in negotiations over a new potash supply contract deal for 2015. The current price is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit and the IPL/Uzagro offers should help suppliers in negotiations for a price increase.
The tender is for delivery in April or May at Chennai port.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: NPK demand falls as spring buying season ends
Domestic demand for NPK dropped in the last two weeks as the spring buying season came to an end. Compound fertilizer is now being applied to land throughout the country.
In the last week, some NPK producers have published their prices for the summer market, which are mostly for high nitrogen compound products like 28-6-6. Some of their NPK prices fell slightly, partly because of the decline of demand and partly attributed to price falls in feedstock like ammonia and MAP.
The 15-15-15 SOP based NPK is quoted between RMB 2,150-2,250/mt EXW and 15-15-15 Cl-based product is priced at RMB 1,750-1,900/mt EXW. For 18-6-6 high nitrogen compound, the price ranges between RMB 1,700-1,800/mt EXW.
With price falls in nitrogen and MAP continuing and domestic potash prices also slipping towards a recently signed import contract price, questions remain over whether NPK prices have further to fall in China.
But for NPK plants, there are some positive indications. During the spring, an important change was the popularity of bulk blends and slow released compound/blend fertilizers in the Northern part of China. Bulk blends are not only competing with NPKs but also grabbing some market from DAP as a standalone fertilizer
product. In recent years, the phosphate nutrient in bulk blends mostly came from DAP instead of granular MAP. So the growth of bulk blends may reduce the market size of both compound fertilizer and DAP.
South Korea: Potash imports up almost 30% in March
In March, South Korea imported 49,279 mt of potash, a 28% increase year on year, according to GTIS data.
During the month, South Korea imported two shipments above 20,000 mt from Canpotex and BPC while 5,500 mt was imported from Laos' producers.
In the first quarter of 2015 South Korea imported 178,976 mt, a 16% increase on Q1 2014 and the country's largest Q1 potash imports since 2005.
Canpotex provided 68% of South Korea's total potash imports during Q1, a reduction in the market share of Canpotex' Q1 shipments from 74% of the total in Q1 2014 and 90% in Q1 2013. BPC on the other hand shipped 26% of South Korea's Q1 volumes, an increase from 23% in Q1 2014 and just 9% in Q1 2013.
Southeast Asia: Market builds toward tender season
Southeast Asian potash prices are quoted stable this week as suppliers attempt to push up prices in the coming tender season after settling the Chinese contract.
Malaysian standard MOP is being quoted at $315-325/mt CFR with only small quantities being booked and little buying interest in the country.
Some suppliers recently said they were looking to increase prices towards the $330/mt CFR level in Malaysia and will hope these prices can be achieved in the May tender season. Importers have noted more interest in prices above $315/mt CFR than in recent weeks and most have increased their prices to at least $325/mt CFR.
In Indonesia, the recent Sinar Mas tender for 100,000 mt is believed to have been extended but offers were made around $335/mt CFR. In addition, there are rumours that a significant tender for H2 delivery as high as 500,000 mt is soon to be announced by Petrokimia Gresik for second half delivery.
In Vietnam, BPC is shipping another cargo of 30,000 mt this week at roughly $340/mt CFR and prices remain quoted at $340-345/mt CFR with only small deals. As a result, prices in Southeast Asia remain at $315-345/mt CFR with Malaysian prices holding down the low end of the range.
China: Domestic market continues to fall after new contract deal
With more settlements of the 2015 potash contracts, Chinese domestic prices keep sliding further towards the new price. Port wholesale prices are down by RMB 100/mt ($16/mt) already compared to the prices before the settlement between BPC and Chinese buyers on March 19.
This week mainstream port wholesale prices for Russian red standard MOP on the whole remain stable at RMB 2,050/mt ($330/mt) FCA, while the low end has dropped to RMB 2,030/mt ($327/mt) FCA.
Compared with the relatively stable price of red standard MOP at port, there is a significant drop in the high end price for white 62% K2O product, which is seen at RMB 2,150/mt ($346/mt) FCA this week, down by RMB 50/mt ($8/mt) compared to last week. Overall, these prices have dipped by RMB 100/mt ($16/mt) compared to the period before the 2015 potash contract settlement.
With the increasing arrivals of imported cargoes, some big distributors expect that domestic prices will remain weak throughout the rest Q2 2015, in particular in May-July when large volumes of fresh cargoes under the 2015 contracts arrive in China.
QSL slashed its potash prices this week. According to the price list announced by QSL Industry on April 15, the price of standard crystal MOP is now RMB 2,000/mt ($323/mt) CPT, the price for standard powder MOP is RMB 1,960/mt ($316/mt) CPT, and the price for 62% crystal product is RMB 2,070/mt ($334/mt) CPT.
All of QSL's new prices were effective from April 15 and went down by RMB 130/mt on average compared to the price list announced on February 6.
China: Uralkali signs quantity agreement
Uralkali has reached a deal to supply 850,000 mt of firm quantities to China between April and December 2015, the company said in a statement.
The agreement has been signed with Sinochem, CNAMPGC and CNOOC.
The company said the deal does not include optional volumes but was signed at the $315/mt CFR contract price agreed by BPC in March.
The deal is for seaborne volumes, while Uralkali also sends roughly 1.3 million mt a year by rail to China, making it the country's largest potash supplier.
Canpotex recently signed a 1.8 million mt firm agreement, BPC signed a firm 1.7 million mt and APC signed a firm 600,000 mt.
With roughly 1.3 million mt of seaborne volumes sent by Uralkali to China in 2014, the 850,000 mt deal may be a sign that Uralkali could reduce its exports to China in 2015 following the loss of production from Solikamsk-2 late in 2014.
SULPHUR
ANALYSIS
Sulphur price drops $15/mt in Saudi Arabia and the US but has the floor been reached?
The market was not surprised to see the announcement of the $15/mt drop in Saudi Aramco's May price at the beginning of the week. Such a reduction had already been anticipated following the sharp drop in prices announced previously by Adnoc and Tasweeq.
Equally unsurprising but equally welcome to the industry is the drop in Q2 liquid sulphur contracts agreed in the US for Mosaic at a $15/mt reduction on Q1.
There has been little activity this week as buyers watch and wait in the hope of further weakness. Demand from the phosphate sector is slow with a number of the larger phosphate producers in China planning turnarounds from now and into May. Likewise in India, CIL, PPL and IFFCO are also taking plants down for annual maintenance whereas in Jordan, IJC is down, JIFFCO is planning a shutdown but JPMC is due to resume operations at Aqaba following its scheduled turnaround.
The Tunisian industry continues to face further challenges with even more curtailments in production ongoing since the end of 2014. Only in Morocco is demand comparatively buoyant and fuelled further by the recent startup of OCP's JPH-1 with its 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit that has been brought up ahead of the phosphate units.
Phosphoric acid production at OCP's existing units is running at relatively good levels through April and this trend should continue into May. OCP is still negotiating its Q2 sulphur contract prices and is looking for a reduction of at least $15/mt on Q1.
The question remains as to how much further, if at all, this market will fall. The next test will be next week's Tasweeq tender which will provide further clarity on the direction of the market.
With demand from the phosphate side still relatively slow and expected to remain so until at least the end of the month, the general feeling from the industry is that a floor is yet to be reached.
Highlights of the Week:
∙Saudi Aramco announces $15/mt reduction in May price to $140/mt FOB
∙$15/mt reduction achieved in Q2 liquid sulphur contract in the US to $132/mt FOB
∙Turnarounds in China and India will keep demand slow
∙Q2 price for North Africa yet to be finalised
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
Tampa: Phosphate producers win $15/lt cut for Q2 sulphur
Settlements finally emerged half way through April for Q2 contract liquid sulphur pricing between suppliers and US Gulf phosphate producers in the US Gulf. Mosaic said April 15 that it had settled its Q2 business at $132/mt FOB Tampa, down from $147/mt FOB for Q1. The Q2 price tag is just $3/mt above the Q4 Tampa price. Phosphate producers in the US and elsewhere have pushed sulphur suppliers hard to take into account falling DAP values and concerns about weaker crop prices going forward compared to the last couple of years.
EUROPE
Poland: Morocco continues to dominate Polish export line up
In calendar year 2014, Morocco took 429,000 mt, some 85% of all Poland’s export availability for the year. A further 24,000 mt went into Brazil with 15,000 mt each to Argentina and Germany.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Qatar: Tasweeq tender closing April 21
As reported last week, Tasweeq will close its next tender on April 21 for 35,000 mt.
Jordan: No news yet on IJC tender
There has been no news emerging on the IJC tender in Jordan for 40,000 mt sulphur and which closed on April 13 for delivery May 15-20. IJC took its plant down for annual maintenance at the end of March. The plant will remain shut through April.
JIFCO has no requirement for sulphur at present but if the planned maintenance shutdown does not go ahead in May, as originally scheduled, it may return to the market for a May cargo. Confirmation of the maintenance dates is still awaited.
JPMC took its phosphoric acid plant down on March 15 for 3- 4 weeks so should have resumed operations this week.
Negotiations continue for Q2 contracts in Morocco
Negotiations are yet to yield a settlement in negotiations for Q2 contracts between OCP and its suppliers. OCP is looking for a reduction of at least $15/mt on Q1 prices previously in the range of $160- 165/mt CFR while buyers are resisting and looking for less of a discount.
Meanwhile OCP claims to have booked spot tonnes in the high $130s / $140/mt CFR from Mediterranean and Middle Eastern suppliers.
Tunisia: Further disruptions to the phosphate industry
Local unrest continues to curtail phosphate rock production in Tunisia with sit-ins by the unemployed workers in the Gafsa region currently halting not only production in the mines but also transport of the rock from some of the mines to downstream plants.
CPG is able to transport rock from two of its mines by rail and is also using private truck companies but overall quantites will be reduced. As such production of phosphoric acid and therefore sulphur demand will have been affected accordingly.
Downstream production in Tunisia improved between September-November last year, averaging
60%. However, this latest wave of unrest and strike action has reduced production levels from December. The last official production estimate showed operating rates fall just below 40% in December.
With Q1 phosphate rock production falling almost 40% against Q1 2014, the new government is making the region a priority and is endeavouring to find solutions to the issues that continue to challenge the industry.
India: Buyers hold out for lower prices
Buyers price ideas have dropped to $150-160/mt CFR India over the past week.
Following the latest posting for May tonnes out of Saudi Arabia confirming the downard trend, the market is holding out for even lower numbers. Demand remains curtailed in line with phosphate fertilizer production as a number of the larger producers take turnounds through April and into early May.
Lower sulphur prices bring additional relief to DAP producers and as such DAP production via the phosphate rock and sulphur route remains the most attractive option for those with captive phosacid capacity. Negotiations are ongoing for Q2 phosphate rock contracts and Indian producers will be looking to offset any potential price rise for rock (on the back of the recent hike in the phosacid price) with lower sulphur prices.
The latest sulphur arrivals in India are as follows:
Iran: Kharg Petrochemical sales enquiry for 30,000 mt
Kharg Petrochemical has issued a sales enquiry for 30,000 mt +/- 10% for April 10-20 lifting at Kharg Island.
Iran: Q1 sulphur exports rise 69%
Iran exported 435,163 mt of sulphur in the first three months, up 69% on the same period a year earlier, the latest GTIS data show.
The country sent 361,900 mt to China, 63,800 mt to Indonesia and 9,500 to Pakistan in the first quarter. The numbers suggest a sharp increase in volumes to Indonesia.
With the start up of the Petro-Abadi joint venture phosphoric acid and sulphuric acid plants mid 2014, Indonesia's sulphur import requirement will have risen by up to 200,000 mt/year. The second such joint venture complex is now under construction in Indonesia with the third in the planning stage and demand will rise accordingly.
March exports totalled 127,000 mt, all of which were shipped to China. The volume was substantially on March 2014 and but less than exports of 160,426 mt in February this year.
Saudi Arabia: Aramco announces May sulphur price at $140/mt
FOB
Saudi Aramco has announced its price for May lifting at $140/mt FOB, representing a drop of $25/mt on its price for April tonnes of $165/mt FOB Saudi Arabia.
This follows Tasweeq's recent announcement of its price for April at $145/mt FOB, down $19/mt from March. Adnoc had previously announced its OSP for April at $140/mt FOB, representing a $35/mt fall against its price for March of $175/mt FOB.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: RCF tenders for 3,000 mt sulphur
RCF has issued a tender for the purchase of 3,000 mt sulphur in bulk (+/-10%) closing at 14:30 hrs in New Delhi on April 20. Offers are to remain valid for 15 days from the date of opening. Payment will be made 30 days after receipt and acceptance of the material.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
South Korea: Q1 sulphur exports hit a record level
The latest GTIS data for March show a recod volume of Q1 sulphur exports at close to 260,000 mt, almost all to China. The previous high for Q1 was in 2013 with 207,000 mt.
Record volumes were also exported in calendar year 2014, reflecting the steady growth in sulphur export trade from South Korea. A total of 852,000 mt were exported with 780,000 mt delivered into China and a further 33,300 mt for the Philippines.
China: Sulphur demand levels off and inventories stabilise
Sulphur demand levels off and inventories stabilise while domestic prices weaken further.
Having fallen below 1 million mt last week, port inventories have remained stable at around 1.1 million mt since the beginning of this week. The price for imported sulphur remains largely unchanged at around $155/mt CFR, reflecting the latest posting by Saudi Aramco at $140/mt FOB for May tonnes. The equivalent port price is quoted at RMB 1175-1185/mt inclusive of import tax and VAT.
On the Yangtse River, prices for imported product are quoted in the range of RMB 1,140-1,160/mt ex warehouse at Nantong and Zhejiang.
At Fangcheng, price indications are considered too high at RMB 1,200/mt to attract any serious interest.
With over half the volume of imported sulphur destined for the phosphate industry, any changes to demand from phosphate producers will have an effect on sulphur. As such plans by a number of the larger producers to curtail production by way of rolling turnarounds through April and into May will temper demand for suphur accordingly.
Crushed lump sulphur is priced in the range of $130-140/mt CFR. Molten sulphur prices for Q2 have been set at around $150/mt CFR but this price was agreed in late March when spot prices were around $160/mt CFR. Currently spot molten prices should be nearer $140/mt CFR if not below.
Puguang has adjusted its price twice since last week, moving it down on April 13 by RMB 50/mt to RMB 1,100 Wanzhou port/RMB 1,000/mt ex works. However it was then moved back up again to the original level of RMB 1150/mt Wanzhou/RMB 1,050/mt ex works on April 14 where it currently stands.
Vietnam: Award yet to be confirmed in Lafchemco tender
Swiss Singapore has been linked with a potential award but as yet nothing has been finalised. Price offers are said to be at or around $165/mt CFR.
SULPHURIC ACID
ANALYSIS
Sulphuric acid prices stable, market largely balanced
Sulphuric acid prices were stable and little changed week on week, with some signs of demand emerging in Brazil, though too little to cause much of a stir in a largely balanced market.
While supply in the Far East remains tight due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds, and Glencore's PASAR smelter in the Philippines confirmed it halted for an estimated 60 days of work, demand is insufficiently high to cause prices to rally.
Sulphuric acid still looks undervalued compared to sulphur, even given the recent drop in sulphur prices.
Pockets of spot demand emerge when traders need to cover short positions, though most seems to be comfortably met under long-term contracts. Talk of a very tight global market is perhaps exaggerated.
The recent flooding in Chile may reduce consumption a little, though the impact is not currently expected to be very significant or lasting. Codelco's Salvador mine will resume production on April 20 and Chileans are downplaying disruptions.
Most market participants are eying potential demand in Brazil in the weeks ahead and wondering when Morocco will rejoin the market as a major buyer.
Highlights of the Week:
∙Petrobras covers 15,000 mt requirement in high $80s/mt
∙PASAR smelter shuts for 60 days maintenance
∙Two Lions exports 6 cargoes to date in 2015
∙South Korea's Q1 exports drop 5.3% year on year to 669,764 mt
∙Morocco still out of acid market, reportedly buying $40-41/mt CFR
∙Chinese smelter maintenance cuts some supply
Base Metals
Base metals were mostly in positive territory on April 16, supported by a weaker dollar and hopes of further economic stimulus from China. LME three-month copper settled $105/mt higher day on day at $6,060/mt, after reaching a four-week low on April 14. Aluminium, nickel, zinc and lead all settled higher.
DAP & Sulphur
The decline in sulphur costs for Q2 negotiated this week for US Gulf phosphate producers was entirely expected. Buyers likely had little trouble convincing liquid sulphur suppliers that falling DAP prices globally could easily lead to production cuts if costs were not reduced. The move makes it more likely that US DAP exports will compete in India in the coming months.
Nor was the sulphur market surprised to see the announcement of the $15/mt drop in Saudi Aramco's May price at the beginning of the week. The reduction had already been anticipated following the sharp drop in prices announced previously by Adnoc and Tasweeq. Equally unsurprising but welcome to the industry was the drop in Q2 liquid sulphur contracts agreed in the US for Mosaic at a $15/mt reduction on Q1.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices reached $1,680-1,700/mt CFR China this week. Prices are expected to gain further support after benzene prices surged following an explosion at the Dragon Aromatics plant in China.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
US: Market quiet though smelter supply emerging
The US acid market remains quiet though some smelter supply may be emerging with one player calling the market largely "balanced to tight". The US Gulf Spot CFR price was assessed unchanged at $70-80/mt, though buyers may be limited at the higher end of that range.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Chile: Lack of spot demand, floods affect infrastructure
Chile is still absent from the spot acid market and the recent flooding in the country may have some impact on consumption, though the situation in the country remains unclear.
There is some speculation that some acid consumption in Chile may be lost due to potential restrictions on transport from port to site. Most players in Chile say there are no disruptions, though others say that inventories are relatively high at port and relatively low at site.
Codelco, the world's largest producer of copper, said its Salvador mine will resume production on April 20, after the rains of March 24-25. The ramp up of output will be gradual, the company said in a filing with the Santiago exchange on April 9.
Codelco restarted its four mines in the Atacama Desert last month after torrential rains forced a
brief shutdown, Bloomberg reported. A number of other mines in northern Chile were also temporarily halted, though most have now restarted after the worst flooding in more than 20 years.
Brazil: Petrobras covers 15,000 mt requirement
Brazil's Petrobras covered a 15,000 mt acid requirement in the high $80s CFR Brazil.
The price is within the range published by Fertilizer Week on April 9 for Sulphuric Acid Bulk CFR Brazil Spot of $80-90/mt.
The cargo is due to arrive at the port of Barra dos Coqueiros at the end of May or early June. Chemtrade has been linked to the sale though this has not yet been confirmed.
Sulphuric acid demand from Petrobras is likely to be fleeting. The company needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.
Elsewhere, it is unclear whether Yara covered a rumoured requirement for two lots of 18,000 mt into Brazil, though market speculation linked Interacid and Glencore with the business. Neither could be reached for comment.
EUROPE
NW Europe: Market quiet with little spot availability
European prices remain stable week on week and prices unchanged with minimal spot availability. The Bulk FOB NW Europe 30 days Spot price is assessed at an indicative $27-35/mt. Some participants believe given CFR prices into Brazil in the high $80s/mt and accounting for a trader's margin, spot cargoes out of Europe may theoretically achieve a price has high as $40/mt FOB.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP remains on sidelines
OCP remains out of the market for spot sulphuric acid.
The company says it has paid $40-41/mt CFR Morocco for its recent limited business.
OCP has largely withdrawn from the acid market because of the scheduled startup of the first of its new integrated hub plants with its own captive sulphuric acid capacity.
The 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit is in the final trial phase , the first of the production units in the first complex to start up, as previously reported by Fertilizer Week. While the company's phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus acid available for use in OCP's other facilities.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Acid availability remains a concern
Availability of acid remains a concern for phosphate producers. Spot price ideas are in the range of $60- 80/mt CFR, with most pegged in the $70s/mt CFR.
SSP buyers are sourcing from the local producers in the price range of INR 4000-5000/mt. ($65-80/mt).
Maintenance is underway at IFFCO and CIL that will run until mid-to-late April and PPL will undergo a shutdown from April 20, as reported last week.
The latest sulphuric cid arrivals in India are as follows:

ASIA AND OCEANIA
South Korea: Q1 acid exports fall
South Korea's sulphuric acid exports in the first quarter fell 5.3% year on year to 669,764 mt, the latest trade data from GTIS show.
About 40% of total export availability in Q1, 264,676 mt, went to China. Thailand absorbed 112,305 mt, the second highest volume, and an increase on the previous year of 73%. India grew its Q1 acid imports from South Korea by 35% year on year with imports of 105,337 mt in the first three months of 2015.
Tonnes to Chile declined 30% in Q1 to 51,001 mt.
Current spot acid availability is very low in South Korea, with Korea Zinc understood to be sold out through much of Q2. One of the five units at Korea Zinc is currently undergoing maintenance, but with little impact on
production.
The assessment for Japan/South Korea Spot/Contract remains indicative and unchanged at $17-22/mt FOB. A price as high as $30/mt FOB may be achieveable for sales into India, as opposed to East or Southeast Asia, though this remains a notional level give the lack of product.
China: Two Lions exports 6 March cargoes but nothing yet in April
Two Lions, China's only acid exporter, is understood to have exported six cargoes of 18-22,000 mt through March, though there has been no business in April.
Trammo is rumoured to have taken three cargoes, with two suggested to Mitsubishi and one to Glencore.
Two Lions last week restarted its second sulphur burner in Jiangsu province. The unit had been down since January 2014.
After more than 12 months out of service a restart at the plant, able to produce in excess of 1 million tonnes a year of acid, was necessary to avoid a deterioration of plant and equipment.
The company has achieved very little export business over the past year, though tight availability from Japanese and South Korean smelters meant that some buyers needed to source Two Lions product recently.
Though sulphur-burnt product struggles to be competitive with smelter acid, the company will be benefitting from current falling sulphur prices. It is also able to boost margins by selling steam produced during the burning.
Philippines: Glencore's PASAR smelter shuts for maintenance
Glencore's PASAR copper smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for an estimated 60 days of planned maintenance and work to increase capacity, a source at the smelter said today.
The current annual sulphuric acid capacity of PASAR is 500,000 mt and work at the site is intended to double acid production, though a major increase in acid output is not likely to be felt until 2016.
The majority of the acid was historically taken by the neighbouring Philphos plant for the production of phosphates. Philphos has been shut since November 2013 following Typhoon Haiyan and PASAR has been exporting increased volumes of acid since then.
With Philphos not expected to restart operations in the near term, any additional volumes from the expansion of PASAR will be sold into the international market.
China: Acid market stable even as sulphur declines
China's sulphuric acid market was stable and little changed over the past week, even as sulphur prices continued to show signs of weakness.
Major smelter acid producers do not plan maintenance for April and May, though some smaller to medium- sized operations will shut.
Northern Copper of Zhongtiaoshan Group, in Shanxi province Northern China, has two acid operations with a total capacity of 540,000 mt/year. The line with 420,000 mt/year acid capacity will start maintenance from April 25 for a month.
Yanggu Xiangguang, a large copper smelter in Shandong province, is also scheduled for equipment maintenance from mid May. The total sulphuric acid capacity of the company is 1.2 million mt/year.
Zhongyuan Gold Smelter, a new operation, shut down its old operation of 120,000 mt/year acid in early April. The new 1.2 million mt/year sulphuric acid operation will start commissioning on May 8, with commercial operations expected from May 25.
Sulphur burner operating rates have dropped from around 74% to 70% and in some cases even lower. Demand from non-fertilizer industries is said to be lacklustre as China's economy slows and traditional industries, such as chemicals, suffer.
NPKS
MARKETS
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Venezuela: NPK imports reach record high in 2014
Venezuela imported 605,000 mt NPKs in calendar year 2014, a 45% increase on the previous year and the third consecutive year of record imports, according to GTIS data.
During 2014, Venezuela imported 310,000 mt from Russia, almost double the volume supplied in 2013, with a further 144,000 mt shipped from Poland's Police plant. Meanwhile, the volume of imported NPKs from Colombia into Venezuela has been growing steadily over the past five years, up from less than 5,000 mt in 2009, to almost 125,000 mt in 2014.
