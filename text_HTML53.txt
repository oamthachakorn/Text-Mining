UREA
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Prices up but Q1 imports down 19.35% year on year
Importers have raised bids for additional quantities of granular urea into the $270s/mt CFR, but offers are no lower than $280/mt CFR following the surge in granular values in the Middle East.
Brazilian imports of urea in March identified by customs via GTIS of 251,000 mt were down by about 0.5% on March 2014. Russia supplied about 70,000 mt, followed by the UAE with 53,500 mt and Qatar and Kuwait with 47,000 mt and 36,500 mt, respectively.
Q1 imports of 705,000 mt were down by about 19.4% on Q1 2014. Russian deliveries of 188,000 mt were laregely in line with the prior year while arrivals from Qatar of 181,000 mt were up by 39% on the first quarter of 2014. Supplies from Oman of 88,500 mt were up by 16.3% while UAE arrivals of 53,500 mt were off by 39.2% and deliveries from Kuwait were down by 32% to 49,000 mt. Chinese arrivals of 31,000 mt were down by a full 66%.

Baltic Sea/Belarus: Grodno scraps April 17 tenders
GrodnoAzot booked a tiny parcel of prills for overland delivery to a nearby market in the April 17 tenders for the sale of 25,000 mt each granular and prilled urea, and scrapped the sessions for the balance tonnage, citing low prices.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: Granuar ureas prices up further
Boosted by prospects of additional demand in the US and to regional markets, Middle East producers have been able to raise netbacks into the $270s/mt FOB, up from returns in the $240s/mt FOB in prior delas by traders in Brazil.
Local reports indicate that Fertil secured a return close to $275/mt FOB bulk equivalent in a sale of 15,000 mt bagged material to an East African importer, and a cargo of Omani urea was suggested to have traded close to the Fertil netback. The deal purportedly done by SIUCI could however not be confirmed with the party alleged to have taken the tons.
Netbacks from Thailand have also improved, with two sales suggested around an even $280/mt CFR following prior deals around $275/mt CFR, and there is significant open interest in additional cargos.

India: STC closes April 10 tender with awards for 510,000 mt
Indian importer STC has closed its April 10 tender for an unspecified quantity of urea pursuant to the issuance of awards for the 510,000 mt listed in the April 17 Market Alert. The additional 30,000 mt indicated available by Global did not get booked. A follow-up tender by IPL is expected in the first half of May. Coromandel Int'l is meanwhile in discussions with suppliers for a full supramax cargo of urea for Vizag for June arrival to be used as raw material for NPK production.
STC's awards are tabulated in the following:

Apt= As per tender
M=Mundra, K=Kandla, Kp= Krishnapatnam, Pi= Pipavav
Indian Financial Year (FY) April-March 2014-2015 imports of 8.75 million mt were up by 23.4% on the 2013- 2014 FY according to the latest provisional FAI trade data.
Sales of urea totalled 28.4 million mt during the April 2014-March 2015 FY, up by 1.4% on the prior year. The March volume marginally below 2.5 million mt was up on the 2.02 million mt delivered in March 2014, and followed an increase in February 2015 to 2.7 million mt from the 2.05 million mt sold in February 2014.
Domestic production of urea was a shade short of 1.7 million mt in March 2015, bringing the total close to
22.6million mt for the full FY. This was down by 0.6% on the 2.72 million mt produced in the April 2013- March 2014 FY:
Closing stocks with individual Indian states were at a mere 130,000 mt at the end of March, but that quantity does not include imported quantities in ports and urea en-route to the states. A minor portion of quantities procured via the 1.15 million mt purchases in the December 3 IPL tender and most of the 1.03 million mt booked via the January 27 MMTC session had not reached individual Indian states at the time the data was collected.

US Tampa: May price tag fixed at $465/mt CFR
The Tampa May price tag has been fixed at $465/mt CFR, down $20/mt on April, evidencing further weakness in the market.
The decrease was expected due to ongoing downwards price pressure both West and East of Suez.
The revelation last week that PotashCorp would be exporting more ammonia from Trinidad served to create even more pressure on Tampa pricing with Mosaic already arguing that falling phosphate values should stem any further increase, as seen for April Tampa prices.

CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: GTIS data show drop in Q1 MAP imports for 2105 but not as sharp a drop as ANDA data showed
Only 12,000 mt difference between ANDA and GTIS MAP imports for Q1 2015; at 365,000 mt and 353,000 mt respectively.
GTSI data for March show 353,000 mt MAP imported in Q1 2015, down from 473,400 mt imported in the same period last year but almost 70,000 mt up on 2013.
The data show considerably more from Russia this year, up at 145,000 mt, and correspondingly less from Morocco, at 55,000 mt. Interestingly the data show 75,000 mt arrive from Morcco in Q1 last year, not so much more than in 2015, mainly due to with loading delays out of Jorf Lasfar at the beginning of 2015.
This year has seen Russian producers take the decision to compete on price to place tonnes against a backdrop of slow European demand while OCP has held back from selling into Brazil at the lower prices.
A modest quantity of MAP was reported from China during Q1 this year, just 42,000 mt, down from 89,000 mt last year.
ANDA data, published last week in Fertilizer Week showed imports of over 600,000 mt MAP in Q1 last year whereas GTIS data for Q1 last year showed just 473,000 mt last year. This year the two sets of Q1 import data were more aligned with a difference of just 12,000 mt betwen the two. There are two possible reasons for the discrepancy last year, one is the difference in the timing of the data collection, i.e. ANDA data comprises cargoes that have been cleared for discharge whereas GTIS may take a later date. Therefore factors such as congestion at the ports, which occurred this time last year, can make a significant difference to the final numbers. The other reason could simply be a matter of grade/naming particularly with 10-50-0 and 11-44-0.
GTIS data for Q1 2015 show NP imports at 151,000 mt almost split equally between Chinese and US product. Q1 NP imports in 2013 and 2014 were higher at 210,000 mt and 246,000 mt respectively.
DAP imports, according to GTIS, reached 123,000 mt, a similar quantity to 2014 but down on the volume of 257,000 mt recorded for Q1 2013. This year almosty 100,000 mt DAP came from the US with a further 25,000 mt from Russia. We can expect more from origins other than the US and Morocco this year, following the removal of the 6% duty on imported DAP from certain origins such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Mexico.
Imports of TSP and SSP were also down this year, as reported by GTIS. TSP imports were recorded at 46,000 mt in Q1, most originating from Israel. Just 4,400 mt came in from North Africa, substantially lower than in previous years. Morocco alone shipped 93,000 mt TSP in Q1 2013 and 48,000 mt in 2014.
Brazil: High level of Q1 phosphate rock imports
Q1 phosphate rock imports into Brazil reach close to record levels.
Latest GTIS data for March show Brazilian rock imports for Q1 at 471,000 mt, close to the record volume imported in Q1 2013 of 500,000 mt. Imports in Q1 last year were down at just 325,000 mt.
Although the volume of Bayovar rock for Vale was recorded at a lower level of 259,000 mt over the first three months of 2015, imports from Morocco reached 180,000 mt, a volume not seen since pre-Bayovar days.
As the ANDA data published last week in Fertilizer Week showed, Brazilian P2O5 production of P2O5 products was up by 9% on last year but not as high as 2013, reflected in the trend of Q1 rock imports over the same period.

Russia: Phosagro sold out and indicating $470/mt FOB for June
After a period of aggressive selling and pricing in a number of markets in Asia and the Americas, Phosagro has lifted its price indications being fully committed through April and May.
Phosagro claims to be sold out until June on the back of recent sales to India, Brazil and its domestic and nearby markets. It has sold up to seven cargoes of mainly DAP plus some NPKs to Indian buyers, most for IPL and IFFCO for March/April/early May shipment. Total known tonnage committed to date for India is in the region of 92,000 mt NPKS and 222,000 mt DAP. The price for the initial DAP cargoes for India was heard in the mid $480s/mt CFR which given a freight estimate of around $31/mt, would give a netback for direct DAP sales in the low-mid $450s/mt FOB Baltic.
Additional sales of MAP have also been made for Brazil for April/May shipment and Phosagro is now quoting $470/mt FOB Baltic for June shipment for MAP/DAP. It is also quoting $330-340/mt FOB Baltic for 15-15-15 following sales of this and other grades to India, the domestic and nearby markets plus some tonnes believed to have loaded for Venezuela.

India: FAI show low imports and production for 2014/15 but sales and stock data do not reveal true picture.
Imports and production in 2014/15 were both below the average for the previous five years, 2 million mt below in the case of imports. March sales figures show movement into the retail system rather than end user demand.
The latest FAI data show total DAP production in India for the 2014/15 fertilizer year at 3.44 million mt, a six year low and well below the average of 3.8 million mt produced in the previous five years. The highest level of DAP production in the past five years was in 2009/10 when 4.25 million mt DAP were produced. This year production of DAP was particularly low in the run up to the Rabi season, with the industry regularly producing below 300,000 mt per month, mainly due to the the high cost of inputs.
NPK production in 2014/15 meanwhile reached a three year high of 7.83 million mt, above the five year average of 7.55 million mt. In 2010/11 and again in 2011/12, India produced over 8 million mt NPKs .
Imports of DAP for the full fertilizer year 2014/15 reached 3.82 million t after almost 100,000 mt arrived in March.
Although more than the 3.3 million mt imported in 2013/14, the volume imported in 2014/15 was still 2 million mt DAP below the average import volume for the last five years of 5.8 million mt. The main reason for the
lower import volume was due to the late start to the import season caused primarily by concern over the monsoon. The even lower level of imports in 2013/14 had been due to the collapse in the rupee value against the USD.
The excessively high stocks built up between 2011 and 2014 of over 3 million mt DAP (at their peak) appear to have been finally brought back down to normal levels. FAI data, although not showing the complete picture, show a clear trend of falling stock levels through the past few months with closing stocks at the end of March at just 152,550 mt.
This was matched by the corresponding hike in reported sales for March of 755,360 mt. This should not be confused with actual sales to end users which are traditionally very low at this time of year. Rather it will be positioning by the industry into the retail system ahead of the budget and any potential drop in subsidy rates.
Therefore the low stock level of 152,550 reported by the FAI is underestimating the true picture as much of that sales volume of 755,000 mt reported in March, will have been stockpiled but stored within the retail system rather than sold to farmers. Even though stocks may therefore be as much as 800,000 mt or even a bit more, this can still be considered a healthy opening stock level for 2015/16 and well within optimum levels.
India: Up to 280,000 mt Russian and US DAP said to be heading for India
Russian and US cargoes, totalling up to 280,000 mt DAP, are heard heading for India but confirmation from both suppliers has been withheld.
Further details have come to light regarding the sale of up to seven Russian DAP/NPK cargoes by Phosagro reported in the last Fertilizer Week Phosphates Report.
Phosagro has declined to comment on this business so price details are not clear yet but initial business was heard concluded in the mid $480s/mt CFR. Details of six of these cargoes are believed to be as follows:
*15-15-15 and 10-26-26
Mosaic is said to be loading a panamax this month for its own distribution system in India however Mosaic prefers not to comment on any shipments to its Indian system. Current freights from Tampa to WC India are around $27/mt.
GSFC held an enquiry April 18 for a total of 125,000 mt dark DAP (18-46-0) of which 25,000 mt was for shipment to the East Coast and the balance to the West Coast, all for May shipment. GSFC did not receive any offers and the tender is likely to be scrapped. There is talk that it may issue a new tender once the NBS rates are finally announced.
MMTC will close its tender for 30,000 mt DAP on Thursday, April 23 for prompt shipment to Mundra, Vizag or Kakinada with offers to be valid for 15 days.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Vietnam: DAP prices come under pressure
Fiercer competition in the global rice market is a factor in the weakening DAP market in Vietnam with only branded DAP achieving decent prices.
DAP prices have been coming under further pressure not just due to seasonal reasons but as farmers in Vietnam struggle with falling rice prices. Exporters of rice are facing tougher competition on the global market and as such rice inventories are rising in Vietnam leaving farmers with reduced funds.
Current offers of DAP from China are below $490/mt CFR but meeting with no real buying interest with buyers now looking for lower numbers. Cross border tonnes are trading at lower prices in the range of $470- 475/mt CFR bagged, falling from $475-480/mt CFR 10 days ago. Branded DAP is still achieving a premium such as Australian and green DAP offered by from YUC, both trading over the past two weeks at or just above $500/mt CFR.

India: Fertilizer year potash imports increase by third
India imported 4.2 million mt of potash in the fertilizer year 2014-15, a 32% increase on the previous fertilizer year, according to the latest FAI data.
During the Kharif season, potash imports were up 31% to 2.3 million mt while during the Rabi season, potash imports were up 33% to 1.9 million mt.
March potash imports were up 81% year on year to 202,000 mt, which along with more than 200,000 mt of potash in April, allows some buyers to build stocks and strengthen their negotiating power in the current contract talks.
Closing stock at the end of March was more than double that of the same point in 2014, at 289,410 mt.

Indian potash sales to non-complex manufacturers during the fertilizer year increased by 27% to 2.8 million mt meaning that potash sales to complex manufacturers are likely to have increased by roughly 41% to 1.4 million mt.
During the fertilizer year 14/15, Indian NPK production increased by 12.7% or almost 900,000 mt. Rising levels of NPK output mean increasing demand for potash, which is not produced in India, and this trend is expected to increase as DAP producers increase NPK production to offset high phosacid prices.
Most buyers in India now expect that potash imports could hit a record five million mt in the fertilizer year 2015-16 but await clarification of the NBS rates, indications of the monsoon outlook and potash contract pricing before any firm forecasts.
SULPHUR

US Gulf: More Q2 liquid sulphur contracts close
PotashCorp reached agreements with its liquid sulphur suppliers late last week at $132/lt FOB Tampa covering Q2 deliveries to the company's phosphate operations. This is down $15/lt from the company's Q1 deal and in line with contract prices agreed by Mosaic and its suppliers last week.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Q2 contracts yet to settle
Suppliers of Russian product have yet to settle Q2 contracts, as producers and consumers have not been able to reach a consensus price.
Although buyers expect a substanial decrease, Russian producers are not willing to accept the scale of increase being sought, and so negotiations drag on.
Meanwhile, the resumption of river transport from April 1 has not gone as smoothly as sought. Low river levels have meant that only small volumes can be sent at higher-than-expected costs. Sellers already had a backlog of product to ship, and these issues have meant that this has not yet been resolved and only Q1 obligations have been shipped thus far, suggesting that all Q2 shipments will need to be completed within May and June.
EUROPE
Europe: Settlements for Q2 reported at decreases and rollovers
Some European sulphur contracts for Q2 have reportedly been settled at a rollover from the previous quarter, and one buyer confirmed achieving a slight decrease while others continue to push for decreases.
Traders suggested that some large buyers have confirmed rollovers, though Fertilizer Week has yet to verify this.
One buyer at the TSI conference in Barcelona said that they had achieved a slight decrease of aroundd $5/mt, while another buyer said they would continue to seek a decrease of at least $10/mt.
Buyers are suffering negative effects from the strong dollar because they buy feedstock in dollars but sell product in euros, leaving them exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. The buyer also argued that availability for product was good.
But sellers have argued that availability is tight as a result of refinery turnarounds and therefore prices should increase.
Refineries currently under or soon to begin maintenance included Mineraloelraffinerie Oberrhein (MIRO), Germany’s largest refinery in Karlsruhe; Shell's refinery in Pernis, the Netherlands which is Europe’s largest; ExxonMobil’s refinery in Port Jerome, France; and the Isab refinery in Italy, 80%-owned by Lukoil and 20% owned by ERG.
Work on Total’s Donges refinery in France was postponed to May from March, and is now scheduled to take place from May 4 to June 25. Total’s Lindsey UK refinery also recently underwent maintenance.
Neste’s refinery in Porvoo, Finland, this month (April) started an eight-week turnaround, the largest in the refinery's history.
Maintenance at Mediterranean facilities has also ramped up. In addition to the Isab maintenance, Greece's Aspropyrgos facility went offline for scheduled maintenance from mid-April.
When negotiations for Q2 sulphur commenced, buyers were seeking decreases of $10-15/mt while sellers were expecting increases of $10-15/mt, leaving many away from negotiations expecting a rollover. Contracts for Q1 were settled unchanged from Q4 2014 at $158-170/mt CFR for barge/railcar liquid bulk and $170- 200/mt CPT for truckload liquid bulk.
As reported last week, US Q2 contracts for liquid sulphur were settled at $132/lt CFR, down $15/lt from Q1.
NEWS
PRODUCTION
Yara writes down value of Lifeco owing to regional instability
Yara has written down the value of its Lifeco (Libyan Norwegian Fertiliser Company) fertilizer joint venture with the Libyan National Oil Corporation and the Libyan Investment Authority by $112 million, leaving a remaining book value of $18 million.
Yara said that owing to the worsening security outlook in Libya, it foresees further deterioration in operations at Lifeco nitrogen facilities located at Marsa El Brega this year.
The company confirmed it would “continue participating in the governance of Lifeco, with the aim of resuming full production once real improvements are seen in the security and political situation in Libya”.
Yara's 50% shareholding in the joint venture was originally intended to provide the Norwegian fertilizer major with access to the exportable output from the two Marsa El Brega integrated ammonia and urea units. The joint venture provided Yara with the role as exclusive marketer for the ammonia and urea manufactured.
The installations have been hampered by political unrest and erratic supply of natural gas and utilities ever since the 2009 agreement covering the venture was signed, rendering regular operations
impossible. Widespread suggestions of corrupt practices in reaching the agreement with Libyan authorities have also negatively influenced Yara's reputation.

Scoping study finishes at Highfield's Sierra del Perdon potash project
A scoping study for Highfield Resources' Sierra del Perdon project in Spain has estimated that the project could deliver 520,000 mt/year of granular potash.
The study expects that the project will require a capital investment of $233 million and projected operating expenditure to be $155/mt.
The project is slated to have a mine life of 20 years and to deliver EBITDA of $120 million with a net present value of $527 million at an internal rate of return of 38.5%.
Earlier in April the company announced a maiden resource estimate for Sierra del Perdon, the company's second project, showing an Indicated Mineral Resource of 41.8 million mt at 10.7% K2O and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 40.3 million mt at 10.5% K2O.
Highfield recently completed its DFS for its nearby flagship Muga project, proposing a steady state production of 1.1 million mt of granular K2O per year over an initial 24 year mine.
"While our focus remains firmly on the rapid development of our flagship Muga project, Sierra del Perdon's scoping study demonstrates the robustness of our broader project pipeline," Highfield Managing Director Anthony Hall said in a statement.
Highfield now plans to move forward with a pre-feasibility study for the Sierra del Perdon site, with new work to include additional drilling, underground engineering and detailed metallurgical test work.
