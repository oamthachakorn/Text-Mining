Highlights this week
 Urea markets remain stable  Anthracite markets slide
 MAP market prices rise a bit  Sulfur markets remain slack  MOP markets keep steady
 Exchange Rate: USD 1 = RMB 6.4
Urea
China’s prill urea output was 805.5kt during the fourth week of August, up by 2.42% from the week before. Granular output was down slightly by 1.52%, reaching 168.8kt. According to statistics of 26 August, daily urea output was 194.1kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 72.02%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 76.51%, while gas-based producers’ average is 61.06%.
Domestic market
Domestic urea markets remained stable; although the VAT has been reinstituted, prices rose by only $5/t and only in some regions. The atmosphere of wait-and-see is predominant. After the Beijing military parade, some urea makers began to resume production; highway transportation conditions improved gradually.
In North China’s Hebei Province, urea makers began to resume production; prices rose slightly, by $3/t. Industrial demand increased, so prices may have space to rise further. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $245-247/t. In East China, urea market demand in Shandong Province was still weak,
In Central China’s Hubei Province, the atmosphere of wait-and-see remained strong; sales were slow. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $258-263/t. In Southwest China’s Sichuan Province, urea markets showed a slight upward trend; the main urea makers tended to existing orders and sent output to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $258-266/t.
According to data from China Customs, in July China exported 1,003,726 tons of urea, down 9.6% y/y; in the first seven months, China exported 7.748 million tons of urea, up significantly by 46.7% y/y.
Raw materials
Domestic anthracite markets declined on the whole; most of the main coal companies’ sales were still uninspiring. Demand remained depressed; even when sales were made, prices were pushed low. Domestic markets will stay weak in the short term.
North China anthracite markets stayed almost unchanged. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $111-115/t at Yangquan and Jincheng, like last week.
Page 3
In Central China’s Henan Province, anthracite prices were also unchanged overall. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices were $138/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $142/t in Yongcheng. Southwest China’s anthracite markets kept steady; prices there were the same as last week. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $109/t.
Ammonium Sulfate
Domestic ammonium sulfate markets rebounded, especially in Shanxi and Hebei Provinces; where prices rose by $3-5/t. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 63% average operating rate, almost like last week; meanwhile, caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers operated at about 80% on average, also the same as last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $78-86/t in Shanxi Province, $91-97/t in Hebei Province, $94-109/t in East China, $88-100/t in Northeast China, and $94-100/t in Southwest China.
On 31 August, Hebei Handan Steel auctioned 1,100 tons of ammonium sulfate on the internet; the closing price was $91/t, up $8/t from last week. Shanxi Taiyuan Steel auctioned 1000 tons of ammonium sulfate – the starting price was $81/t, but this tender failed.
According to the data from China Customs, in July China exported 293,707 tons of ammonium sulfate, down 20.9% y/y; in the first seven months, China exported 2.9349 million tons of ammonium sulfate, up significantly by 25.3% y/y.
Phosphate & NPK
Production
Typical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 80% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm maintained its recent low operating rate. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and maintained an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.
Domestic phosphate
DAP – Domestic DAP markets remained stable on the whole. Facing the new cost of the resumed VAT, some DAP makers tried to raise their prices by $8-16/t; however, no sales were made at the new prices yet. Most DAP makers still maintained stable prices, due to lots of existing orders, they kept busy. Downstream, traders waited to see the market develop.
Central China DAP markets stayed normal overall. Some of the main DAP makers had enough export orders to keep
them busy for a month; meanwhile, some domestic orders from North China and East China were waiting to be worked. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content stayed at 422/t in Hubei Province, and the same product delivered to North China and East China destinations is $441-445/t, like last week.
Southwest China’s DAP producers continued to maintain the high operating rates; orders now in hand could last to the end of this month. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content are $406-414/t, FOB prices are around $460/t; delivered to North China destinations are $441-453/t.
In July, China exported 752,788 tons of DAP, up sharply by 160% y/y according to data from China Customs; in the first seven months, China exported 3.576 million tons of DAP, also up sharply, by 130% y/y.
MAP – Domestic MAP market prices also rose a bit, but almost no new orders were seen. Some MAP makers chose to stop quoting, waiting for further developments. Sales were weak; the wait-and-see atmosphere dominated the whole market.
Central China MAP market prices went up overall; Hubei and Henan provinces’ MAP makers had some orders in hand. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $336-344/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $375-383/t for powder MAP with 60% content.
Southwest China MAP producers waited to see the market develop; some raised prices. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan province are $320-331/t for powder MAP with
Page 4
55% content, and $336-344/t for powder MAP with 58% content in Yunnan Province.
In July China exported 752,788 tons of MAP, down 21% y/y, according to data from China Customs; in the first seven months, China exported 3.576 million tons of MAP, up 81% y/y.
SSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets remained stable; most makers maintained high operating rates, some even running at full load. Mainstream ex-factory prices were $56-66/t for SSP (12%) and $75-86/t for SSP (16%) in Yunnan Province.
Domestic TSP markets were flat on the whole; mainstream FOB prices stayed at $305-330/t. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 110,000 tons, the same as last week – 50,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 10,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 20,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.
Domestic FMP makers began to resume production gradually. But everywhere, demand is insufficient to sustain the market. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Yunnan and Hubei Provinces are $69-75/t for FMP (12%) and $84-91/t for FMP (15%).
International phosphates
The global phosphates market trade is continuing in the soft trend. The main activity is in the East as the offers for DAP exports to Pakistan and India decline to $460s/t cfr. The offer origins are mainly Saudi Arabia and China. Also Jordan is expected to supply more DAP at new market level under MoU, but there are some production troubles in Jordan plants. Some Africa demand for NPs & NPK is also coming now, as the annual tender from Ethiopia comes in September for NP19-38+S. For the DAP and MAP in the West, there is some gain in US local market to mid $430s/short ton barge NOLA. In Europe and South America however the DAP and MAP prices decline to low $500s/t cfr on DAP to West Europe and $475-480/cfr for MAP to Brazil.
Raw materials
Sulfur: Domestic sulfur markets remained slack; demand was fatigued. Sales did not improve. Most refineries showed
concern about sulfur inventory levels, selling mainly at low prices. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $156-183/t in Northeast China, $183-191/t in North China, $178-208/t in East China, $163-192/t in South China and $175-183/t in Southwest China.
Imported sulfur markets were slack; seaport sulfur inventories started to be sold down slowly. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 978,000 tons of sulfur on hand, 132,000 tons less than last week, with 390,000 tons in Nantong Port, 50,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 255,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 80,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 20,000 tons in Beihai Port, 12,000 tons in Longkou Port and 170,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.
Sulfur Price and Inventory
Note: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.
Phosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets fluctuated little overall; rock prices were stable in the main production regions. Guizhou Province rock markets saw almost no change; rock prices kept steady. FOT prices for 30% content stayed at $52/t from Wengan and $63/t from Kaiyang. Sichuan Province phosphate rock producers maintained the same operating rates as last week, and the rock prices were also constant: mainstream prices are $41-44/t for 28% content at Mabian, $34/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock companies kept running normally. The local market saw no price changes: $58/t for 28% content, $66/t for 30% content. In Central China, Hubei Province phosphate rock market prices remained stable at low level, $63-75/t for 28-30% content in Yichang.
NPK
Domestic NPK – After the Beijing military parade, some NPK
Page 5
makers in Hebei and Shandong Provinces began to resume production. The main NPK companies planned to raise NPK prices due to the VAT resumption; however, the intended increment was not made public. Mainstream prices for NPK products are stable at $306-313/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $344-359/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as last week. In East China, Shandong Province’s NPK market prices rose a bit, by $5-13/t, but the sales volume was almost unchanged. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $297-313/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $344-359/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as last week. In Central China, Hubei
Province’s NPK markets remained sluggish on the whole; the local market demand was not much. The downstream purchasers kept cautious, watching the market develop. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $289-305/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $344-359/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In Northwest China, Shaanxi Province NPK markets saw no adjustments. Operating rates were not high, and new orders were rare due to the off season. Mainstream ex-factory prices stayed at $297/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $344/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).
Potash
Domestic potash
Domestic MOP markets as a whole kept steady. Due to the new policy reinstituting VAT on inventory fertilizer, MOP makers raised prices to some extent. In Qinghai Province, small producers continued to increase their operating rates. Yanhu Group still ran its MOP units at full load; its MOP capacity will reach 5.5 million tpy this year. Yanhu produces 20,000 tons per day. Its prices stayed at $341/t for white MOP with 60% content. Golmud Zangge produces 6,000 tons per day; its price for white MOP with 57% content is stable at $286/t.
MOP import markets remained flat overall. Some importers did not announce new prices but waited to see the market trends develop further. Imported MOP inventories in seaports stayed high. Russian red MOP with 60% content sells for $317-331/t in most ports; Russian white MOP with 62% content is $341-347/t. The border trade MOP markets were still quiet; no new MOP will arrive in this month. Most traders there have suspended sales and are preparing to adjust prices.
Domestic SOP market prices rebounded slightly. The main SOP producers kept shipping smoothly and reduced their SOP inventories gradually; most of them showed no special concern for inventory or sales. Mainstream prices are $438-484/t for powder SOP with 50% content and
$484-516/t for granular SOP with 50% content. Xinjiang Luobupo Company’s SOP units resumed production 25 August, producing 4,000 tons per day. Its annual SOP capacity is 1.6 million tons. The firm’s new, higher price for granular SOP with 51% content is $508/t.
International potash
The market is seeing bearish atmosphere. The troubles of US dollar strength against the Malaysia and Indonesia currency is the cause of difficulty on the new imports of the standard MOP, and no notification of new tenders. The last price levels said for these markets is about $310/t cfr Malaysia bulk or low $320s/t cfr Vietnam. For the granular MOP, there is competition in Brazil market at low $300s/cfr levels, down from mid $310s/t cfr last month. Also in USA domestic there is stronger competition as the local barge price for the imported granular MOP is now going to $290s/short ton fob.
