Fertilizer Shipping Market Report
Current trend: UP
The Far East market is firming up with an increasing number of cargos with second half of June dates. Many steels and a handful of fertilizer cargos can be seen from Far East which is providing owners with more confidence, even if it could just be for the short term. There has also been number of ‘above market’ fixtures with India and PG direction. Southeast Asia is supported by coal back into India and other destinations, along with a slight increase in the number of nickel ore stems. Several short period fixtures have been seen, with slightly healthier numbers than anticipated.
Outlook: UP/=
The market has shown some signs of improvement over the past few days and we expect this to continue for the coming week.
PANAMAX
Current trend: UP
Time charter rates went up across all routes as ECSA pulled in tonnage from North Atlantic, India and S.E Asia with decent time charter rates. In the east rates were tick up due to the general sentiment however the activity on NOPAC and Indo rounds remained low. There was short period interest but numbers discussed were on the lower side.
.
Outlook: UP/ =
The current push in the market is fueled by ECSA and USG becoming active and pulling in ships from different corners, but it remains to be seen how long this change can help the rates to improve further.
