○China’s Sulfuric Acid Production and Consumption in 2014
China Sulfuric Acid Industry Association hosted the association’s annual conference on June 16-17 in Hefei City of Anhui Province.
According to the association, last year, China produced
92.51million tons of sulfuric acid, up 6.9% y/y. More specifically, the country’s smelter gas-based sulfuric acid output increased by nearly 20% y/y, accounting for more than 30% of the total output; and the country’s sulfur-based sulfuric acid output increased by only 1.9% y/y.
China’s sulfuric acid production is more concentrated. In 2014, the country’s top ten sulfuric acid makers produced
30.32million tons of sulfuric acid, accounting for 32.8% of the country’s total, 1.7 percentage points higher than the previous year.
In the first four months of this year, China produced 29.45 million tons of sulfuric acid, up 6.7% y/y; and imported 3.61 million tons of sulfur, down 2% y/y.
According to QI Yan, director of China Sulfuric Acid Industry Association, 60.9% of China’s 2014 consumption of sulfuric acid was for fertilizer production; 86.3% of the country’s 2014 sulfuric acid consumption for fertilizer production (or 52.5% of the country’s 2014 total consumption of sulfuric acid) was for phosphate fertilizer production; and 92.8% of China’s 2014 consumption of sulfuric acid for phosphate fertilizer production was for high concentrated phosphate fertilizers.
In 2014, the country’s average price of sulfuric acid increased by RMB 70/t y/y. The prices of sulfuric acid average RMB 300/t in domestic markets.
QI Yan said at the conference that China’s sulfuric acid capacity will increase slowly in the coming years. Efforts will be made to control the construction of new plants, extend product chains, develop cyclic economy, and enhance the industry’s capabilities in engineering and design.
○Operation of China’s Coal Industry from January to May
In the first five months of this year, China produced 1.46 billion tons of coal, down 93.21 million tons or 6% y/y; and
1.32billion tons of coal was sold around the country, down 127 million tons or 8.8% y/y, according to DONG Yueying of China Coal Delivery and Marketing Industry Association.
From January to May, 859 million tons of coal was rail delivered around the country, down 103 million tons or 10.6% y/y. In May alone, 165 million tons of coal was rail delivered around the country, down 25.09 million tons or 13.2% y/y. The country’s monthly rail delivery volume of coal has kept declining for nine consecutive months.
This year, the prices of coal have been declining in domestic markets. China Coal Price Index was 131.2 points on June 12, down 10.6% y/y. The prices of power coal at Qinhuangdao Port were RMB 410-420/t on June 17, the lowest in nearly ten years. In early June, the average price of coking coal was about 30% lower y/y.
As of the end of May, the country’s total coal inventory has remained at more than 300 million tons for 41 consecutive months. At the end of May, the coal mining enterprises held a combined coal inventory of 106 million, up 7.2% y/y.
The country’s Jan.-May consumption of coal is estimated at around 1.57 billion tons, down 5% y/y. More specifically, 790 million tons was for electric power generation, down 6.3% y/y; 270 million tons was for steel industry, down 2.1% y/y; 190 million tons was for construction materials, down 8.5% y/y; and 1 million tons was for chemical production, up 9.7% y/y.
During the eight years until end-2014, China’s coal mining capacity grew by 3 billion tpy. For some large coal mining firms it is necessary to keep up a high output of coal.
On the other hand, Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia AR, China Shenhua and China Coal and some other large coal producers have cut their coal output. China’s coal output is projected to decrease this year by 5%.

○Rail Freight Rates Lowered for Cotton and Fertilizer
Delivered from Xinjiang AR
Rail freight rates for some key products delivered from Xinjiang AR to other areas had been lowered, starting on June 12.
More specifically, for cotton, the rail freight rate was lowered by 15% from RMB 0.161/t per kilometer to RMB 0.137/t per kilometer. That means, for example, a RMB 96 reduction for delivering one ton of cotton 4,000 kilometers. Delivery of a ton of fertilizer 4,000 kilometers from Xinjiang would be reduced by RMB 50/t.

SOP markets still weak
Exchange Rate: USD 1 = RMB 6.2
Urea
China’s prill urea output was 808kt during the third week of June, up significantly by 6.18% from the week before. Granular output was down slightly by 1.01%, reaching 167.9kt. According to statistics of 24 June, daily urea output was 188.6kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 73.43%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 80.66%, while gas-based producers’ average is 56.05%.
Domestic urea markets weakened a bit; some areas’ urea prices slid since the end of last week. Although India held urea tenders, the closing prices were too low. The representative price was $307/t, FOB China – very disappointing to those involved in export. Meanwhile, the domestic sales situation is also face unfavorable. The frequency of new signed orders has been decreasing quickly.
In North China, Shanxi Province urea prices were reduced a bit; most urea makers have few new orders, and low sales
Page 3
volumes have become a worry. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $268-271/t. East China’s urea markets remain stable, but urea prices there also began to drop slightly. The local industrial demand in Shandong Province is slack; and seaport urea prices lack support. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $279-282/t. In Central China’s Henan Province, urea markets continued to weaken on the whole; new orders from local customers are rare. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $274-281/t.

International phosphate
The global phosphates trade volumes are still moderate. The DAP spot prices are firming in North Americas, but flat in most of the markets of Europe, Asia, and South America. For the detail of Asia, the market is now dominated by the India DAP moves, after the new phosphoric acid agreement at $5pt increase to $810/t P2O5 cfr India for July-December 2015. Today the India DAP interests are moderate in volume, and price offers remain in same range of the low $480s/t cfr India for China DAP. So far the July DAP from Saudi Arabia is not offered. Saudi Arabia netback from the
other markets e.g. Pakistan is in mid $470s/t fob. The price of delivered MAP 11-52 to Brazil is now about $490/t cfr level, but for Argentina to $505/t cfr. The US export price holds steady in mid $470s/t fob Tampa. For US local market, the DAP value is higher to low $420s/short ton. For Europe, the internal market price of DAP holds up near $530/t fot port warehouse.
Raw materials
Sulfur: Domestic sulfur markets remained stable after the
dragon boat festival: sales decreased, but trade was quiet overall. Some refineries maintained low sulfur inventories. Existing orders were adequate to keep busy. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $174-189/t in Northeast China, $192-195/t in North China, $190-202/t in East China, $182-293/t in South China and $195-205/t in Southwest China.
The sulfur trade in ports also kept steady as port inventory levels continued to drop. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 943,000 tons of sulfur on hand, down 21,000 tons from last week, with 320,000 tons in Nantong Port, 75,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 158,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 80,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 43,000 tons in Beihai Port and 210,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.
Sulfur Price and Inventory
Note: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.
Phosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets as a whole were stable; prices did not change at all. Guizhou Province phosphate rock markets kept steady. Having endured heavy rains in earlier weeks, some rock mines
Page 5
remained idle. The main rock producers sold down their inventories. FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock markets were the same as last week: prices there are unchanged, and sales remain weak. Mainstream rock prices are $61-65/t for 28% content in Mianzhu, $35/t for 28% content in Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock markets remained slack; producers shipped normally. Rock prices there are $42/t for 28% content. In Central China, Hubei Province phosphate rock markets went steady overall. Rock prices hardly changed: $65-77/t for 28-30% content in Yichang.
NPK
MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $355/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In North China, Shanxi Province’s NPK markets remained steady overall. The local producers plan to announce autumn fertilizer policies and prices. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $290/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $347/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In Central China, Hubei Province NPK makers posted new prices for autumn fertilizers. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $290/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and around $368/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).
Page 6
powder SOP with 50% content, $500-516/t for granular SOP with 50% content. Xinjiang Luobupo Company’s annual SOP capacity is 1.7 million tons. The company has stopped production to overhaul for two months. SOP prices remain stable: powder SOP with 51% content is $452/t and granular SOP with 51% content is $484/t.
International potash
The main news of international potash business is the offer by PotashCorp to take-over K+S of Germany. The market now needs to wait to see official K+S reaction and the
regulatory opinion. The markets have expected the move to be rejected. If so, observers would look to see if the attempt becomes hostile, and if the bid is improved. If achieved, it would make over 25% of world capacity into one company. The spot markets stayed quiet, only the new contract of 835,000t sMOP from Israel to India coming in form of new contract news. This is at established price of $332/t cfr India. This is since the strike stopped at the ICL Israel production. For the granular MOP, the target of increase to $340/t cfr Brazil is still under discussion by main suppliers.

New Fertilizer Project in China
1) Urea Project (1000tpy, Product)
Note: some new projects have been completed in 2011, and were delayed to put into production to 2012, such as Guodian Chifeng, Guizhou Jinchi, Jinxin Chemical, Kuitun Jinjiang Chemical and Yangmei Heshun.
We revised the 2011’s table and put these projects into 2012’s table. In addition, 520k tons of urea capacity of Inner Mongolia Tianrun has been delayed to 2013 due to uncertain factors. So the actual new capacity of urea in 2011 putting into production was 3.14m tons.

  |  Domestic NPK – Due to high prices for urea and MAP,  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  
  |  domestic NPK makers have been concerned about costs.  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  
  |  However, NPK markets are off season, and the main  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  
  |  producers have not adjusted prices. Mainstream prices are  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  
  |  $282-306/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15),  |  $323-355/t for  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

  |  Jiangsu Province, NPK makers lowered their operating rates.  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

  |  unchanged. Qinghai Province MOP makers kept up high  |     |     |  Canada  |  339-347  |     |  40  |     |     |

  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  
  |  MOP capacity is 5.5 million tons. Yanhu produces 20,000  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  
  |  white MOP with 62% content is $339-342/t, the same as  |  
  |  tons per day. Its prices are $316-323/t for white MOP with  |

  |  60% content, the same as last week. Golmud Zangge  |  
  |  received at the main ports during this month. Demand in  |  
  |  produces 7,000 tons per day; its price is $316/t for white  |  
  |  Northeast China is very limited, so most of the incoming  |  
  |  MOP with 60% content, the same as last week.  |  
  |  supply is sent to North China and East China. Prices stayed  |  
  |     |     |  
  |  In the MOP import market, the seaport prices were still  |  at $282-290/t for Russian MOP with 60% content.  |     |     |     |  
  |  steady; sales declined because of the  |  off season. The  |  Domestic SOP markets were still weak this week. Some SOP  |  
  |  seaport MOP inventory is about 1.06 million tons, almost  |  
  |  producers maintained low operating rates; they expressed  |  
  |  unchanged from last week. Russian red MOP with 60%  |  
  |  hope that slowing production would relieve worries about  |
