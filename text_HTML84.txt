ANALYSIS
Potash prices weaken as discipline falters in Brazil
Weaker prices are seen in most potash spot markets this week as suppliers fail to achieve their targets in Brazil and weak demand hits prices in the US and China.
In other news, the board at K+S rejected PotashCorp's takeover proposal on the grounds that the €41 per share offer undervalued the company and that PotashCorp had not alleviated worries over plans for the German company's salt operations and high-cost German mines. PotashCorp has yet to respond to the statement but has already informed K+S that it may decide to go past the board and offer to K+S shareholders the acquisition via a public takeover offer.
In the markets, suppliers price goals for June and July deliveries to Brazil have largely failed, with very few deals signed at $340/mt CFR. Most sources say that supplier discipline has failed to hold and quote prices at $325-335/mt CFR, many believe that suppliers will struggle to surpass $350/mt CFR levels by the end of Q3 unless there are significant changes to the market environment.
Demand has slowed across many potash markets in a seasonal lull. US NOLA barge deals cannot be seen above $320/st FOB but with BPC now considering holding off from deliveries in Q3 the market may be less oversupplied in the coming months.
The Chinese domestic market is also out of season and standard prices have fallen to RMB 1,980-2,100 ($319-338)/mt FCA.
In Southeast Asia foreign exchange rates continue to hold down potash prices with Malaysian potash deals still seen as low as $300-310/mt CFR. Major suppliers are staying out of the Malaysian market and focus on the other Southeast Asian markets where prices are seen in the $320-340/mt CFR range.
Despite weaker potash prices in Brazil, the US and the Chinese domestic market, suppliers are more confident of achieving their new price targets in the European market. As yet, the goal of €315-320/mt CIF gMOP has eluded potash producers but deals cannot be seen lower than €305/mt CIF this week in the European market.
In the UK, Sirius Minerals received approvals from the North York Moors National Park Authority to mine polyhalite in the UK. The company will now look for funding towards the £1.7 billion mine and aims to have a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.
Readers should also note that potash indicative prices have been updated this week to take into account new prices and freight levels entering Q3 2015. For most suppliers, the $10/mt contract increases in the Chinese and Indian standard markets have been largely offset by weaker spot prices through H1.
Highlights of the Week:
∙K+S board rejects PotashCorp takeover proposal

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade- weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.
MARKETS
MOP
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Lack of interest keeps market flat
The main story in the region remains the lack of interest in booking substantial fall tons compared to prior years due to carryover. Comments from distributors vary, with the divide primarily between those reporting more-than-typical volumes of granular potash and those reporting normal inventories.
Demand generally was better in the Midwest through the spring application season compared to other major US markets. Postings remain at $335-365/st FOB.
US NOLA: BPC shipments for fall in question
BPC, which re-entered the US market in the just completed US fertilizer year, has said it is not committed to ship granular potash in time for the US fall season.
The producer cites reports of higher inventory levels in the US supply chain at the end of the spring, and the lower prices seen in the US since the start of the spring season.
Previously traders had hoped to buy 160-200,000 mt of BPC potash in time for US fall sales. Assuming no cargoes arrive in time for the annual closure of the upper Mississippi River in October, then there would be no requirement for BPC cargoes to reach the US until February in order to participate in the spring season.
In the meantime, granular potash barges are cited around $320/st FOB New Orleans.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Colombia: Potash imports continue above average
Colombia imported 153,900 mt of potash between January and April, an 8% increase year on year, according to GTIS.
During the period, Colombia imported 72,000 mt from Canpotex, 60,000 mt from Uralkali, 15,000 mt from K+S and 7,000 mt from SQM.
In April, Colombia imported 54,000 mt of potash, a 7% increase, with 35,000 mt from Uralkali and 17,000 mt from Canpotex.
Uralkali recently confirmed around 15,000 mt of gMOP for delivery to Colombia in the $340s/mt CFR.
Brazil: Buyers continue to resist target prices
Suppliers have struggled to get their target $340-345/mt CFR prices for July deliveries to Brazil with potash deals seen as low as $325/mt CFR this week.
Suppliers had hoped to push up prices by $5-10/mt in each month leading into the autumn season but with high stocks, issues with farmers credit, low agricultural commodity prices and high competition, suppliers have struggled to sell product above $330/mt CFR.
Most sources say that supplier discipline has failed to hold and quote prices at $325-335/mt CFR. There are even unconfirmed deals signed as low as $320/mt CFR, highlighting the significant difficulties in the way of suppliers. With July shipments largely booked, suppliers are unlikely to increase their targets when it comes to August in light of the current market.
Canpotex and BPC recently confirmed deals for around 100-150,000 mt of potash at $340/mt CFR but most sources consider these to be outside the range for most potash deals and could include some kind of discount.
Suppliers hope that farmers will increase buying once new lines of credit are given in July and that worries of higher delays during autumn at the Brazilian ports may lead to increase buying in July and August.
However, many sources do not expect the new credit to filter into the hands of farmers until August at least and believe that market conditions currently make it unlikely that suppliers will achieve significant
price increases as we move through Q3.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Belarus: BPC and IPL sign MoU on potash deliveries
Belarusian Potash Company and Indian Potash Ltd. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding regular deliveries of potash for five years starting in 2016, Belarusian state news agency BelTA said on June 29.
"The document is further evidence of the close cooperation between Belarus and India. The memorandum implies regular supplies of potash from Belarus to the Indian market from 2016 to 2021," BPC's press service told BelTA.
IPL is believed to have agreed deliveries of 600,000 mt potash with BPC for the current fertilizer year along with optional agreements for another 100,000 mt.
BPC, which generally has a smaller market share in India than Canpotex or Uralkali, said that it expects the deal will strengthen its position in the Indian market and help develop the agriculture industry there.
The news comes as Indian buyer IFFCO also met BPC representatives this week regarding long-term supply deals. IFFCO Managing Director Dr Awasthi said that there had been "fruitful discussions about long-term supply".
IFFCO currently gets its potash fertilizer needs, believed to be around 500,000 mt a year, through IPL, so the long-term agreement between BPC and IPL may include some volumes destined for IFFCO.
Indian contract deals have already confirmed higher demand in this fertilizer year and news of future agreements may help India to combat its imbalance in nutrient application.
EUROPE
Europe: Suppliers more confident over price goals in Europe
Suppliers continue to target €315-320/mt CIF gMOP prices across Europe with little activity due to a seasonal lull in demand. Currently prices are quoted in the €305-310/mt CIF range.
Indications are that European buyers are less against the price increases than in Brazil and that €315/mt CIF levels may have already been achieved in some unconfirmed deals.
European potash prices were considered comparatively weak in Q1 as euro exchange rates hit very low levels. Suppliers managed to correct the prices and a slight euro resurgence has meant that gMOP prices are seen as high as $344/mt CFR at current exchange rates.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Sri Lanka: Tender offers seen around $345/mt level
Sri Lanka's Ministry of Agriculture tender for 28,700 mt of sMOP which closed on June 29 is expected to be awarded in the next few days.
Offers came in from a range of suppliers including Uralkali, BPC and APC at prices believed to be above the $345/mt CFR with 180 days credit level.
In February, the MoA's last tender for 24,000 mt potash was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd with Uralkali tonnage after they made an offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit. The product was delivered in May.
India: High imports arriving on new contracts
In the first 10 days of July, 150,000 mt of potash is scheduled to arrive in India as volumes from recently- signed contracts begin to filter into the country.
Of the volumes, 63,000 mt are going to Zuari via two BPC shipments and a 36,000 mt shipment from Canpotex. Canpotex is also sending a 31,500 mt shipment to RCF while BPC is sending one 36,750 mt shipment to IPL and one 15,000 mt shipment to TCL.
ICL recently signed contracts to supply 835,000 mt of potash including options to customers in India between April 2015 and March 2016. The deal meant that current estimates for firm contracts have reached as high
as 4.5 million mt compared to 3.9 million mt in the last fertilizer year. Total imports in the 2014/15 fertilizer year reached 4.2 million mt so potash imports in the current fertilizer year are likely reach at least 4.7-4.8 million mt and may be as high as 5 million mt.
The price on the new Indian contracts is $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit, a $10/mt rise on the previous year.
Inland, dealers and retailers are said to already be full with potash stocks and any slowdown in demand may put pressure on importers for higher discounts on the Maximum Retail Price. According to one source, dealers in the northern regions are offering discounts in the range of INR 1,500-2,000/mt ($24-32) on
the potash MRP with some importers currently at breakeven point for potash.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Thailand: Record potash imports continue through May
Thailand imported 338,765 mt of potash between January and May, 21% higher than the same period in 2014 and the highest ever imports during the five-month period, according to GTIS.
During the period, Thailand's potash imports from Canpotex were largely flat at 132,000 mt, but imports from BPD increased 20% to 93,500 mt and SQM sent 38,000 mt compared to zero in the same period 2014.
In May, Thailand imported an impressive 100,000 mt with 43,000 mt from Canpotex, 27,000 mt from SQM and 18,000 mt from BPC.
The country is considered highly-competitive market with prices currently quoted at $330-340/mt CFR.
Japan: Potash imports slow after strong Q1
Japan imported 230,000 mt of potash between January and May, an 11% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.
After January to April imports reached a five-year high, May imports were down 44% to 49,000 mt, including 25,000 mt from Canpotex, 8,000 mt from Uralkali and 6,500 mt from BPC.
The fall meant that January to May imports were down 11%. During the period, Japan's imports from Canpotex fell 20% to 164,000 mt but imports from Uralkali increased 87% to 27,500 mt and imports from BPC increased 36% to 15,000 mt.
Canpotex signed contract agreements to Japan for the first half of 2015 at an average price of more than $410/mt CFR but recent spot deals are believed to have been made at around $350/mt CFR. Canpotex is expected to announce prices for H2 shortly.
Southeast Asia: Forex rates continue to hit potash markets
Southeast Asian standard potash prices continue to be seen this week at $300-340/mt CFR with Malaysian currency depreciation continuing to hold down the low end of potash deals in the region.
Malaysian prices are seen around $300-310/mt CFR as slightly higher deals on a ringgit basis are offset by currency depreciation against the dollar. The Malaysian ringgit has weakened 18% against the dollar in the last 12 months.
However, the deals are said to be very small and major suppliers are staying out of the market until stocks deplete and demand increases. Most suppliers have their prices held at $320/mt CFR and higher for Malaysia.
With the market generally out of season deals are hard to come by in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Prices outside Malaysia remain in the $320-340/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia.
China: Domestic potash prices slip again on reduced demand
Slow purchasing activity and reduced demand have caused further price drops in the Chinese domestic potash market.
Offers remain stable with mainstream Russian red standard potash trading at RMB 2,000-2,020 ($323- 326)/mt FCA and the low-end of Russian red standard trading as low as RMB 1,980 ($319-320)/mt FCA. The high end of white 62% K2O MOP remains at RMB 2,100 ($338)/mt FCA.
QSL prices are seen stable at the levels indicated in its April 15 pricelist. QSL's price for standard crystal MOP is RMB 2,000/mt CPT, with standard powder MOP at RMB 1,960/mt CPT
Granular potash deals are seen at just RMB 2,050 ($330)/mt at port, a similar level to the current weak Brazilian and US NOLA prices.
May saw imports fall to 560,000 mt and June imports are also expected at a lower level. At the same time rail imports in May from Uralkali are said to be just 90,000 mt with June and July rail deliveries expected at a similar level.
During a conference call this week, Uralkali said rail to China has seen a significant decrease so far this year and previous expectations or 1.3 million mt of rail deliveries may not be reached in 2015.
SOP
EUROPE
Europe: SOP prices rise on tight market
Increased demand and tight supply in the European SOP market has again pushed up prices.
SOP prices in Northwest Europe are at €470-520/mt FCA with contract deals at the low end and limited spot business by K+S and Chinese suppliers made at the top end. There are some unconfirmed deals as high as €550/mt FCA.
Last week, Fertilizer Week reported that Chinese SOP producers doubled their year-on-year SOP exports in May bringing year-to-date exports to 54,000 mt compared to 13,700 mt in the same period last year, including 18,000 mt to Belgium.
Tessenderlo is still on track to increase production at the end of 2015 once it has converted its plant at Ham, Belgium, to a stand-alone SOP unit while other suppliers are likely to bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year, easing some of the tight availability.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan: SOP imports at high level so far in 2015
Japan imported 52,000 mt SOP between January and May, a 36% increase on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.
During the period, Japan imported 24,000 mt from K+S, 18,000 mt from Taiwanese suppliers, 3,800 mt from Namhae and 3,700 mt from Chinese producers.
In May, Japan's SOP imports doubled to 12,500 mt. During the month, Japan imported 12,500 mt from K+S, 2,500 mt from Taiwanese producers, 2,100 mt from Namhae and 2,100 mt from Chinese producers.
China: SDIC Luobupo stops for maintenance
Chinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo closed for planned summer maintenance last week and is unlikely to reopen until the end of August.
The company produced around 150,000 mt SOP in May, bringing its January to May production to 850,000 mt. Chinese SOP prices were last seen around RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT.
NPKS
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan: NPK imports down January-May
Japan imported 37,500 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 22% fall on the same period in 2014 and the lowest level for this period since 1997, according to GTIS.
During the period, South Korean imports from Namhae fell 42% to 19,000 mt while imports from Chinese NPK producers increased 49% to 13,500 mt.
The country imported just 4,000 mt of NPKs in May, with around half coming from Namhae.
Southeast Asia: NPK prices slightly lower with market out of season
Southeast Asian NPK 16-16-16 prices are seen at $395-415/mt CFR this week as a seasonal lull in demand and stiff competition lowers price levels.
In Thailand, prices are quoted in the $395-405/mt CFR range with other markets making up the higher end of the range.
Thailand imported 415,928 mt NPKs between January and May, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. During the period, Thailand imported 275,000 mt from Russian producers and 124,000 mt from Yara.
Imports were very low until May, when Thailand imported 110,000 mt compared with 26,000 mt in May 2014. During May, Thailand imported around 50,000 mt each from Russian producers and from Yara.
NEWS
FINANCIALS
Migao Corp. see's 20% increase in yearly revenues
Chinese speciality potash fertilizer producer Migao Corp. said its revenues in the financial year ending March 31 were CAD 444.5 million ($356 million), a 20% increase year on year as higher sales and prices helped the company.
As a result, Migao swung to a gross profit of CAD 47 million in the year compared with a gross loss of CAD 9.6 million in the previous year.
The SOP and NOP producer said that market conditions for SOP were strong throughout 2015 compared with one year ago with higher average selling prices, but that higher sales were offset by decreases of roughly CAD 51 million in its sales of compound fertilizers and ammonium chloride.
The company said that Chinese demand for NOP, compound fertilizers and ammonium chloride were weak through the year but that appreciation of the Chinese Yuan against the Canadian dollar also contributed to the dollar-based revenue increases.
In the quarter ending March 31, revenues were $208.7 million, an 11% fall on the previous year due to lower average selling prices in all products except SOP, couple with lower sales volumes for all products.
Migao announced earlier this year that the second phase of its NPK and NOP production line with EuroChem will be launched this year. In total, the joint venture will produce as much as 60,000 mt/year NOP and as much as 200,000 mt/year NPKs in Yunnan by the end of 2015, with both parties having a 50% stake in the deal.
Uralkali struggles in first quarter as revenues fall 17%
Russian potash producer Uralkali's Q1 revenues fell 17% year on year to $720 million due to lower production and reduced sales volumes.
The company's production in Q1 fell 8% to 2.7 million mt following the loss of output from its SK-2 mine after flooding at the end of 2014. Sales volumes during the quarter were at the even-lower level of 2.5 million mt, a 17% fall year on year as subdued demand in key markets hit sales. The company attributed lower demand to currency fluctuations, lower crop prices and farmers using up existing stocks.
Despite this, some of the reduction in sales volumes was offset by an increased average export price of $256/mt, up 19% year on year after very low potash prices in Q1 2014 following the break-up of Uralkali's alliance with Belaruskali.
The company said it expected shipments to increase in H2 following a draw-down of inventories and as the autumn application seasons take place, particularly in Brazil where suppliers are targeting price increases in the next few months.
Uralkali expects potash demand in 2015 to fall to 58-59 million mt from 63 million mt in 2014.
The company said it continued to implement its plan to mitigate the damage following the flooding at SK-2. It is pumping out brine and strengthening the walls between the flooded mine and the nearby Solikamsk-1 site, but the sinkhole which opened near the mine has now tripled in area since February to 118 metres by 129 metres.
Uralkali said that during the spring thaw, average brine inflow between March 6 and June 29 was around 300 cubic metres per hour.
If there is no significant increase in flooding, Uralkali expects production to be higher than originally planned for 2015, Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Osipov said during a June 29 conference call. The company is managing some production from SK-2 in the clean-up process and Osipov said that output could reach 10.4-10.8 million mt in 2015 rather than the original estimate of 10.2 million mt, made following the initial mine incident. Uralkali produced 12.1 million mt in 2014.
The news comes as the Russian producer announced on June 23 that it reviewed the results of a recent share-buyback programme and may de-list from the London Stock Exchange.
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
K+S rejects PotashCorp takeover proposal
The board at K+S rejected its proposed takeover by PotashCorp, arguing that it does not reflect the fundamental value of K+S and was "not in the best interest of the company".
K+S confirmed that PotashCorp has offered €41 per share to acquire all of the outstanding shares in the company via a written proposal.
"Not only does this proposal undervalue our potash and magnesium products and our salt business, it completely disregards the value of our Legacy Project," K+S chief executive Norbert Steiner said in a statement.
The offer represented a 40% premium to K+S's share price when it was made public on June 25 but since then shares have rallied and are currently seen at €37.
K+S pegged the value of Legacy at up to €21 per share and said this value is not reflected in their current share price.
The German miner has already invested more than €2 billion in the project, with first production expected by the end of 2016 and positive cash flows planned from 2017 onwards.
"We believe PotashCorp is trying to take advantage of the valuation gap to take over K+S and gain control over Legacy," Steiner added.
The K+S board said the proposals are not in the best interest of the company, noting that PotashCorp has not shown it has a sustained interest in continuing the company's fertilizer and salt businesses in their current form.
"PotashCorp has made no firm commitments to protect the interests of the more than 14,000 employees of K+S worldwide. Despite repeated requests to address this question, PotashCorp's answers have remained vague," Steiner added.
Last week, K+S said that PotashCorp informed the company that it may decide to go past the board and offer to K+S shareholders the acquisition via a public takeover offer.
For more information on the proposed takeover please see Fertilizer Week's recent Insight on the offer.

BHP Billiton hands responsibility for Jansen potash project to Valle
BHP Billiton has shifted the leadership of its major Jansen potash development project in Canada to group project-management executive Dean Dalla Valle.
The company named Valle as chief commercial officer and said he would oversee the Jansen development rather than petroleum president Tim Cutt. Valle takes over management of the asset from August 1.
Shaft excavation is continuing at the 10 million mt/year project and the overall project is running within budget and roughly 40% complete. It is believed to be nearing 50% complete.
In February, chief executive officer Andrew Mackenzie said that BHP is likely to make a decision within 4 or 5 years on whether to move towards production at the site and BHP continues to plan an investment of $2.6 billion in the project from 2013 through 2016, with annual spending of less than $500 million on Jansen.
"Its all about timing ourselves into the market," Valle said in an interview with Bloomberg in Sydney on July 2. "This has the potential to be a material business in the future, in a market that's growing."
PROJECTS
Fired Karnalyte Resources CEO takes back control
Former chief executive of struggling potash junior Karnalyte Resources, Robin Phinney has reassumed control of the Canada-based company and wants to resurrect its proposed Wynard potash solution mine.
A majority of Karnalyte shareholders last week voted to replace the board of directors with six new directors, including Phinney.
The decision marks a U-turn for the resource company after it wrote off its investment in Wynard earlier this year, arguing that the mine would not get enough financing amid lower potash prices.
In May, the company stepped back from the decision, saying it was prepared to make some concessions to avoid a legal battle with Phinney and a group of shareholders but it seems shareholders were so against the decision to write-off Wynard that they reinstated Phinney.
"We are well positioned to bring the Project to the next level, and most importantly, we have a Framework Agreement with KRN's largest shareholder, Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd., to negotiate a major round of financing to fund the project which could be transformative for the Company," Phinney said in a recent statement.
Karnalyte continues to propose to produce 625,000mt/year of potash initially through solution mining before ramping up to 2.1 million mt/year of potash.
Sirius gets go-ahead for York Potash project
North York Moors National Park Authority's planning committee has agreed to approve Sirius Minerals' plan for a £1.7 billion polyhalite mine in the UK.
The committee voted 8 in favour of the potash mine, with 7 against the plans, according to a spokesman from Sirius Minerals.
The committee listened to arguments for and against the mine in the morning of 30 June before making its decision. The meeting comes two weeks after the North York Moors planning authority released a report highlighting certain problems with the application regarding environmental issues but not making a decision on whether it should go ahead.
The decision had already been delayed until May from the start of this year and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council has already given the go ahead for the section of the mine transportation system in its jurisdiction.
All of the other major approvals have been given apart from Sirius' application for harbour facilities, which is currently being examined by the planning inspectorate.
The company will now move forward with construction of the site, towards a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.
Shares in Sirius are up roughly 60% since the decision.
