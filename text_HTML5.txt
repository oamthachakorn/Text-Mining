ANALYSIS
Future price direction dominates IFA ammonia talks
This week’s IFA Istanbul conference failed to stimulate additional demand with most of the focus on future price direction.
Despite the fixture of the June Tampa price just one week ago, the July price level to be agreed between Yara and Mosaic is already subject to conjecture. The general consensus is that a rollover at $450/mt CFR would reflect expected limited price movements west of Suez, while others suggest a further decline of $15/mt is not out of the question.
Those few forecasting an increase in the July Tampa figure attribute their belief to continued strong US demand in an otherwise weak market. US Gulf arrivals are bolstered by Koch's line-up after it recently secured just over 100,000 mt from the Black Sea and Baltic priced at around $390/mt FOB, with most tonnes destined for its domestic supply chain. There are indications that Koch is negotiating further purchases from the Baltic, Black Sea and possibly Algeria for July lifting amid reports of production issues at its US facilities.
US phosphate producers Mosaic and PotashCorp are expected to run plants at normal rates, keeping ammonia demand for MAP and DAP production steady over the summer.
US inland demand for ammonia may have taken a slight hit in recent weeks though, as wet weather prevented ammonia applications in most of May. It remains to be seen if US suppliers can catch up in June, or if some farmers will turn to urea/UAN instead of ammonia for supplemental applications for corn acres.
East of Suez sentiment points to continued weakness on ample supply. CJ Indonesia’s tender award to Yara May 26 at $437/mt CFR evidenced little change in pricing, while Koch was able to pick up 16,000 mt from Petronas under a formula pricing arrangement to meet contract commitments in South Korea.
Output at Qafco’s ammonia units continues to run well with all product used against contract commitments. Additional ammonia needs are being met by securing product from Sabic and Ameropa over the next month.
Highlights of the week:
∙Ameropa sells 20,000 mt to Koch ex-Yuzhnny around $390/mt FOB
∙Koch picks up 15,000 mt from Ameropa ex-Sillamae at $390/mt FOB
∙Optimism that Tunisian ammonium demand will soon recover
∙OCP reports full ammonia tanks; seeking below $400/mt CFR for June
∙Muntajat to secure additional cargoes from Ameropa and Sabic
∙Koch buys 16,000 mt Petronas cargo against SFC commitments
∙Namhae seeking July/August additional cargo
Short term outlook:
Softness will prevail in the ammonia market with pricing east and west of Suez expected to move little.
Ammonia versus DAP
OCP is maintaining granulation rates in June at similar levels to May and as such ammonia demand should be relatively steady particulalry as more focus is being given to MAP. In Tunisia and Jordan however, demand will remain curtailed although following the news that rock production has been resumed at one mine, GCT is expected to give priority to DAP production at Gabes and this will prompt renewed ammonia requirements.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices were stable at last week's level of $1,750-1800/mt CFR China following several weeks of increases to their highest levels since early January.
MARKETS
AMMONIA
NORTH AMERICA
US Gulf: Imports needed to restock inland supply chain
US ammonia imports appear likely to step up in June and July, mostly through Koch, as US suppliers take in imported material to help replenish consumption from the direct application market this spring. Speculation about July pricing at Tampa already is underway, with many market watchers betting on a flat $450/mt CFR or even lower price tag. Bullish views are less common.
US Midwest: Side-dress ammonia waits for dry ground
While there are no floods underway in the US Midwest, the ground has been wet for much of the month of May, and farmers have been careful to focus on planting corn during those days suitable for field work. This has left fewer days available for finishing preplant or starting side-dress ammonia applications, according to distributors. There are anecdotal reports of higher sales of urea and UAN in recent weeks compared to seasonal norms. Price is not a factor at this stage, as ammonia remains the cheapest form of nitrogen at $605-625/st FOB.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Petrobras to market ammonia cargos in H2 2015
Petrobras indicated it will have two ammonia spot cargoes available for lifting in H2 2015. The first will likely be marketed in August with the second available towards the end of the year.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic Sea: Koch may repeat recent Baltic purchase
Ameropa has sold a 15,000 mt parcel to Koch reportedly around $390/mt FOB. The cargo will be loaded on the Clipper Neptune early June in Sillamae and will then pick up 25,000 mt from Uralchem in Ventspils.
Uralchem is in negotiations as regards spot tonnage for July lifting, possibly with Koch again.
The supplier will have scarce tonnes to market in August and September as its ammonia facility undergoes a maintenance shutdown.
Black Sea: Koch secures more tonnes for Clipper Orion
Koch secured the remaining 20,000 mt it needed to complete a full 40,000 mt for loading on the Clipper Orion May 28. Its latest purchase from Ameropa is reported concluded within the current Black Sea range at $380-390/mt FOB.
This follows Ameropa's sale to Koch last week on the Gas Grouper for the US. Koch has chartered the vessel from Ameropa for the coming month and will likely use the vessel to shuttle between Trinidad and the US.
Ameropa is also in spot discussions with Qafco’s marketing arm Muntajat for the sale of 23,000 mt on a CFR basis, likely to be delivered to Jordan at the end of June.
OPZ is currently in negotiations for the sale of another 20,000 mt in June, possibly to Koch again.
Despite repeated rumours of a maintenance shutdown at Group DF's Russian plant scheduled for June, firm details on the timetable of such a turnaround were not disclosed at press time.
Group DF's suspension of nitrogen production at its Ukrainian facilities CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot announced May 28 are unlikely to have a material effect on ammonia. The majority of ammonia produced at the units is used to produce urea and ammonium nitrate with only small volumes available for merchant use.
Group DF's other Ukrainian nitrogen units Gorlovka and Severodonetsk in Eastern Ukraine have been shut since May 2014 due to political unrest in the region.
NF Trading has around 23,000 mt spot tonnage available for June lifting:
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Qatar: Muntajat to secure additional ammonia cargoes
Qafco’s ammonia units are running well with product fully committed for June and July with contract customers.
Qafco’s marketing arm Muntajat said it also plans to secure a 23,000 mt cargo from Sabic and a similar sized parcel from Ameropa out of the Black Sea in the next month to be used against contract business, likely in Jordan and South Africa.
Jordan: Subdued ammonia demand likely in near term
Jordanian ammonia demand is likely to remain subdued in the near term as JPMC indicated it will be producing around 450,000 mt DAP this year, down from close to 650,000 mt in 2014. Increased emphasis will be given to phosphoric acid this year including shipments into Indonesia, India and Turkey.
Tunisia: Increased optimism for the fertilizer industry
There was increased optimism among market participants at the IFA Istanbul conference this week that Tunisian fertilizer production will soon get back on track.
CPG has re-started phosphate rock production at its Kef Eddour mine after a three-week total stoppage and months of strikes, sit-ins and general disruption.
Ammonia demand is not expected to increase substantially for another few weeks at least, although one 23,000 mt cargo ex-Black Sea will be arriving in Gabes early June owing to on-going AN production in Tunisia.
Morocco: Buyer seeks even lower values for June
OCP is reported targeting numbers substantially below $400/mt CFR for June ammonia deliveries.
At present the buyer reports its tanks are full following a number of recent deliveries from Yuzhnny and Algeria and is in no hurry to buy additional cargo.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: No uptick in demand expected in coming months
Indian ammonia demand is reported stable and likely to remain so over the coming months. Despite recent arrivals of phosphoric acid into the country, supplies are still relatively limited and not substantial enough to stimulate additional ammonia demand.
Deepak Fertilisers will take delivery of a 7,500 mt contract cargo of ammonia ex-Iran mid June to be priced via formula. The buyer’s next spot requirement is likely to be in mid July.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
South Korea: Namhae seeking yet more spot cargo
Namhae said is in discussions for an additional 15,000 mt parcel for July/August delivery with a number of trader offers received. Namhae’s previous spot purchase was secured at $433/mt CFR from Yara several weeks ago.
Ammonia demand remains weak with suggestions that SFC’s affiliate Tong Suh Petrochemical Corp may reduce its acrylonitrile production rates further.
Taiwan: CPDC likely to buy another Iran cargo
CPDC will target another cargo outside contract commitments for July delivery, likely from Iran. The buyer has secured two spot cargoes from Raintrade since the start of this year and is looking to increase trade further.
Contract prices continue to hover around $450/mt CFR but due to continued weak ammonia demand from downstream caprolactam and acrylonitrile buyers, downward price pressure is set to be maintained.
Malaysia: Koch buys from Petronas
Koch has bought a 16,000 mt Petronas ammonia cargo for lifting on the Bunga Kemobja under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo will be used against Koch’s contract with SFC in Korea.
Indonesia: Yara awarded CJ tender
CJ Indonesia has awarded its May 25 6,000 mt ammonia import tender to Yara at $437/mt CFR.
Kaltim V is reported running ammonia at 75% capacity and urea at 45% after technical issues earlier this month.
