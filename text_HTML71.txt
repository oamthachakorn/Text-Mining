UREA
ANALYSIS
US barge urea values appear to have reached cliff
As in so many weeks and months before this year, many players are predicting the US urea market finally has reached its peak this week. Indeed, it appears the only direction the barge market can go is down from this week’s highest price of $380/st FOB New Orleans. Other prompt sales this week were as low as $346/st FOB, and subsequent offers late June 18 were below that for prompt barges. July offers are around $305/st FOB, and at least one physical barge was sold for delivery in 1H August at $295/st FOB.
MARKETS
UREA
US Midwest: Wet weather prevents demand spike
Even though there is plenty of top-dress demand for corn yet to be satisfied, wet weather continues to slow applications. As a result pricing is far from keeping pace with recent spot costs out of the barge market. Early this week granular urea still was selling from river terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $370/st FOB, $5/st or more below FOB New Orleans quotes.
US S Plains: More rain coming, but prices rise
Granular urea truckloads have sold as high as $410/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River, even though another 5-10 inches of rain is predicted for Oklahoma and Arkansas this week. Texas already has seen heavy rains this week.
Urea prices are rising despite the poor weather outlook because retailers expect substantial demand wherever conditions permit as soon as the storm passes.
Predictions over when barge travel along the Arkansas River will return to normal are increasingly negative. Travel through to Inola Oklahoma may not be restored for at least two weeks, according to various distributors in the region. Meanwhile, distributors are reduced to buying truckloads from terminals along the lower Mississippi River as far south as New Orleans, and driving product 25 st at a time to enduser markets in Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Texas.
US NOLA: Trader shorts drive June sales, July weaker
Push almost came to shove between a few traders on some short sales that needed to be covered by June
15.Multiple sources report that a number of these deliveries had not been completed by close of business June 16.
Most or all of the transactions reported in recent days at $370-380/st FOB New Orleans are accounted for in efforts by traders to find prompt cover for H1 June shorts. Meanwhile, prompt granular urea barges available by the end of this month have sold as low as $343-346/st FOB, but most business appears to be in the $350s/st FOB this week.
By the end of the week, prior sales of early July granular barges at $350-353/st FOB were a memory, and H1 July business was cited around $310/st FOB and physical offers through the FIS service were down to $303/st FOB. Prilled urea has sold at New Orleans this week at $310-315/st FOB.
China Oil's pamanax of Chinese granular urea will not reach New Orleans until the first 10 days of July, not in June as has been claimed elsewhere.
The spot lineups for the US June and July now also include 107,000 mt of granular urea divided between four cargos loading from Algeria. The importers are Ameropa arriving June 25 with 23,000 mt, Trammo arriving June 27 with 30,000 mt, Indagro with 27,000 mt in the first two weeks of July and Koch with 27,000 mt in 2H July. A rumored Gavilon cargo of Chinese granular for July arrival proved incorrect.
US N Plains: Cheaper fill offers tug on spot values
Spot offers of granular urea for prompt delivery crept down this week to around $390/st DEL for trucks and railcars. However, more severe cuts in prompt pricing are likely given fill offers from suppliers for summer delivery from Canada and elsewhere.
Late season disappointment with Canadian demand has led to more aggressive pricing for summer granular urea by Agrium and others into the Dakotas. Offers are as low as $345/st DEL. This is down about $50/st from prior weeks. This price tag likely will be reflected in the prompt market for the Dakotas by July, if not sooner, according to regional distributors.
Canada: Dry conditions hammer crops, cut urea use
Market expectations in western Canada have undergone a 180 degree turn and distributors are expecting substantially lower fill pricing in coming weeks. Just a month or two ago, railcars of urea were moving from
the US for applications on canola and other crops. But severely dry weather since then threatens yields and warehouses in Alberta and elsewhere have substantial carryover granular urea.

UAN
US Midwest: Fill offers put pressure on prompt market
As expected, lower fill offers that include delivery dates as early as July have begun to drag down UAN values in the Midwest. Prompt UAN is on offer from some river terminals as low as $9.06/unit FOB this week, while even the high end of the market has fallen to about $9.38/unit from some inland locations.
The new prompt price range is down roughly $0.20/unit at both ends compared to prior weeks. This follows reports earlier this month of Q3 fill offers at $7.66-7.81/unit FOB in the region. While the volume available at this level is relatively modest, it means the prompt market likely will decline further as June comes an end.
US NOLA: Barges flat, but pressure from imports
UAN barge trades have not been the priority for up-river buyers due to continuing rain in the Midwest. However, once further demand emerges for corn application sales of full tows should re-emerge. As a result nearby indications are unchanged from last week.
Meanwhile, Agronova is loading 40,000 mt of UAN-32 July 1-10 from the Baltic for the US Gulf. The cargo is destined for Gavilon under a previously agreed supply arrangement. Market sources suggested the delivered price paid by Gavilon will result in a cost in a barge as low as $197/st FOB New Orleans.
AS
US NOLA: More Chinese AS booked for US Gulf
A panamax of granular ammonium sulphate plus other products is loading this month from China for Gavilon. Specific volume breakdowns were not clear at press time, but in addition to AS, the vessel is carrying industrial grade AS and phosacid carried in drums.
AMMONIA
MARKETS
AMMONIA
US Midwest: Fill offers $50-60/st below cash market
Distributors in the Midwest claim Koch Nitrogen is offering fill ammonia for delivery in time for the fall season at $535-540/st FOB terminals. This would be $50-60/st below cash costs for the current season, and reflects the bearish attitude reported from farmers and retailers for the upcoming crop year.
US NOLA: Returns on ammonia barges down
Possible returns on ammonia barges and railcars loading for inland destinations from the US Gulf have declined, and are indicated within a substantially lower range than seen in prior weeks. Much of this decline is due to fill indications in the US interior that are $40-50/st lower than in prior weeks.
For now returns on spot sales up river and quotes based on import costs suggest a range of $430-$460/st FOB New Orleans, with the midpoint of the range declining about $35/st from prior weeks.
Tampa: July pricing focus of market's attention
Mosaic is expected to fight hard for a further cut in the Tampa ammonia price tag for its July deliveries. Market watchers are predicting that flat pricing from the June agreement of $450/mt CFR may be the best Yara can hope for, even with more rumors of possible curtailments in August in Trinidad and Tobago . Expectations are for a Tampa July agreement next week.
PHOSPHATES
ANALYSIS
US DAP enters long, uninterested summer
DAP indications are relatively flat over the last two weeks. Barring an unlikely jump in demand for prompt barges the marketplace appears willing to go forward without substantial guidance with regard to fill pricing. Current US spot barge pricing around $420/st FOB still does not support imports from China or Morocco (although Russian producers appear to be wiling to ship modest volumes to the US). Fill offers from Mosaic and at least one importer as high as $440/st FOB New Orleans or the equivalent inland did not excite interest, although the producer is willing to sell prompt barges at $425/st FOB. For now Mosaic seems likely to focus on refilling its consignment warehouse space, and look to the forward market to help it price US DAP.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
US: DAP/MAP exports slightly better than steady
US DAP/MAP exports during May were down modestly compared to May 2014, but not enough to change the trend for the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year through May with shipments moderately ahead of the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.
May 2015 exports of DAP/MAP were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared to 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5. Increases and decreases in shipments to traditional customers varied over the month, with the largest decrease seen in shipments to Canada, which fell to 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5 in May of 2014. The largest customers for US DAP/MAP in May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5.
For the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, DAP/MAP exports reached 1.98 million st (1.8 million mt) P2O5, compared to 1.78 million st (1.61 million mt) P2O5. Much of the year-over-year gain can be traced to shipments to India, which rose to 362,462 st P2O5 from 231,088 st P2O5 over the relevant periods. Other key customers for US DAP/MAP during the current fertilizer year through May were Brazil at 472,167 st (P2O5) and Canada at 287,065 st P2O5.
US NOLA: Lack of interest in prompt DAP
Prompt inquiries are rare at this stage for DAP and MAP, although indications reported from suppliers are $415-425/st FOB. There is greater interest in forward DAP barges that would be available in the Gulf during September. However, at least one importer responded with bids basis open origin material at $440/st FOB for that month. So far there is no support for that price.
US Tampa: Modest interest does little to support market
Mosaic reported a further 17,000 mt of DAP sales this week to multiple Latin American markets. All of the material will load in July and was sold at $470-474/mt FOB Tampa, a $1/mt lower range than the prior couple of weeks.
Markets in the Americas are generally relying on Brazil to set the price for any large purchases in coming weeks, but buyers in that market have not been able to reach a meeting of the minds with suppliers on price for forward purchases.
US Midwest: Little movement expected ahead
Distributors do not expect to move much more phosphate in the coming days and weeks. Postings for DAP remain around $460/st FOB. Some barges still are discharging at northern terminals, and the supply chain in the region is ending the season with more carryover than normal, according to players throughout the region.
US S Plains: Wet weather puts end to phosphate use
Soybean growers in the South are behind in their planting work due to flooding, and distributors predict many of those farmers will focus on planting before worrying about applying phosphate and potash. In some areas fertilizer applicators will follow the planters, but distributors do not report much demand from retailers.
Nevertheless southern states to the east continue to attract new sales to retailers, and prices have not moved at the distributor level in a couple of weeks.
Mexico: Fertinal committed through to September
Deliveries to Chile and the local market through June, July and August mean that Fertinal remains fully committed through to September. Production continues to return to normal.
Fertinal is currently loading around 35,000 mt DAP, MAP and TSP on the Western Feodora for Chile. The balance of June production, estimated at around 70,000 mt and mostly DAP with some MAP, will be delivered into the local market, split between commitments of around 15,000 mt to NW Mexico and close to 20,000 mt delivered by truck and rail to nearby customers.
For July Fertinal will load another 35,000 mt combination cargo for Chile with a second such cargo, due to load end July/early August. The balance of July's production, estimated at around 70-75,000 mt, will be delivered into the local market.
An estimated 40,000 mt will be delivered into NW Mexico in August and a further 35,000 mt Chilean vessel will load either late August or September. Depending on the timing of this last Chilean shipment, a trader has booked 30,000 mt Mexican MAP/DAP for likely shipment to South America.
Production levels have been slowly but steadily improving, rising from a monthly output of 65,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP in May up to around 70,000 mt in June and a further increase in July/August expected to reach nearer 75,000 mt.
The increase has been in part facilitated by the two supplementary rock cargoes booked from Senegal, covering the shortfall caused by previous technical issues in the mine curtailing production but which are now being resolved. The first of these cargoes arrived on the Cano at the end of May and the second will arrive on the Ultra Iris at the end of June. No further imported rock cargoes are planned at this time.
Price levels for Mexican DAP and MAP have firmed up to $475-480/mt FOB with the higher price achievable in Chile where Fertinal has a freight advantage over other potential suppliers. Mexcian TSP is priced at around $385-390/mt FOB.
PHOSPHORIC ACID
US: Phosacid exports got boost in May
US phosacid exports in May jumped 27.5% from one year earlier to 35,396 st (32,086 mt) P2O5, from 27,770 st (25,193 mt). However, the gain did not substantially change the trend over the first 11 months of
the current fertilizer year that has closely mirrored the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.
The jump in May 2015 can be accounted for by the shipment of 8,079 st (P2O5) to Brazil, compared to no exports to that country one year earlier. The lion’s share of US phosacid exports in May were accounted for in the 16,886 st loaded for India.
For the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, US phosacid exports were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared with 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5 in the previous year.
The main customers for US phosacid in the current fertilizer year to the end of May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5. Canada has taken significantly less phosacid during the current fertilizer year through May compared with the prior year at 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5.
POTASH
MARKETS
MOP
US Midwest: Only marginal demand remains
Some potash movement to retailers remains for crops other than corn, but even most of the soybean planting has been completed at this stage. Postings generally have moved to around $365/st FOB, but more and more distributors report retailers have no need to buy prompt tons unless they are offered in line with summer fill values around $350/st FOB.
US NOLA: Seasonal demand done, prices flat
There are few expectations for prompt demand, and suppliers note that values for granular potash already have fallen to a level that supports recent fill offers for the US interior markets. Prior barge trades were claimed at $320-325/st FOB New Orleans.
SULPHUR
MARKETS
SULPHUR
Canada: Vancouver FOB sulphur slightly higher
Prices for spot exports of sulphur from Canada were assessed slightly higher, with the range extending to $130-140/mt FOB Vancouver from $130-135/mt FOB.
However, no firm deals were confirmed at the higher levels, but market participants suggested that business had already been concluded in the high $130s/mt FOB, and price increases elsewhere suggest that levels up to $140/mt FOB should be achievable.
