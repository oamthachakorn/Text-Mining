ANALYSIS
The US barge market finally springs into action
The US is the one market to see real price movement this week with NOLA values moving as high as $430/st FOB after weeks of languishing below $420/st, attracting little or no attention.
The rally was due in no small part to positive movement in US crop prices. Price for corn, wheat and soybeans all increased sharply this week in a weather dominated market, with bullishly interpreted USDA data adding further support. Indeed the crop price index is now at its highest point since mid January.
At the same time concern over a potential shortage of product in the face of zero imports booked for the Fall season has supported the barge price increase. As prices move higher, imports will start to become more of a reality although as yet the differential to the global market is not quite narrow enough to prompt cargoes to be booked but it is probably just a matter of time. The widely expected Moroccan tonnes will almost surely load some time in August/early September.
Should Brazilian MAP demand not warrant any volume selling from Morocco through August, the US will look even more attractive to OCP. By mid September the peak Brazilian season will be over but Europe will yet be starting so outlets at that time will be sought for Moroccan tonnes. Maintaining market share in the US with new capacity coming onstream will surely be a crucial move going forward. Although OCP has been able to benefit hugely from production constraints in Tunisia, South Africa and Jordan, this trend may be short lived and OCP will need to re-establish its own key markets.
In India, a two tier market is beginning to appear with a clear differential between prices offerd by traders for Chinese product and those offered by producers for a direct sale. Producers are becoming more aggressive in the all-important Indian market, looking to remove the middle man where possible and reap the benefits of direct selling. This explains the higher prices offered in recent tenders/enquiries by traders compared with the sales made by producers.
The rupee has stabilised at around 63.5 against the dollar, relieving some of the pressure from importers and as such the market has stabilised in the mid-upper $470s-low $480s/mt CFR but sizeable July tonnage is yet to be priced. Importers are reluctant to price tonnes too far ahead given the tendency for rupee volatility and continued concern over potential rainfall through July and August.
Brazil remains the big disappointment in terms of phosphate demand this year. The lack of volume demand is putting renewed pressure on traders holding long positions, which is in turn putting renewed pressure on price levels. Current prices appear to be nearer the $490/mt CFR level although remain largely untested on limited business. However, hopes by suppliers of achieving $505/mt CFR for July have been extinguished as the market limps along, constrained by the dismal economic backdrop.
Highlights of the Week
∙NOLA price moves up with upper end at $430/st
∙Two tier market for Chinese DAP opens up in India between trader and producer prices
∙Brazilian market weak with MAP prices closer to $490/mt CFR
∙OCP secures more acid sales
∙GCT resumes production at La Skhira but Gabes remains down
∙Crop prices increase in US
Sulphur
∙Adnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $150/mt FOB Ruwais for July, up $5/mt from its June level, representing a delivered price to India in the low $160s/mt CFR. The price is roughly in line with market expectations, and follows recent increases in other postings.
Ammonia
∙Few price changes have been noted across the ammonia price index on a distinct lack of activity. Koch continues to buy up tonnage west of Suez but this is doing little to affect values
Short Term Outlook
Many in the market have already assumed that a final surge in import demand will not now be forthcoming from Brazil over the coming weeks. Whether it does or it doesn't, the combination of supply constraints in Tunisia, Jordan and South Africa plus good prospects for demand from both India and Pakistan and potentially the US should keep the market reasonably stable through the next couple of months. Should Brazil suddenly find some form before the end of its season, this could prompt prices to firm however this latter development is looking increasingly unlikely unless there is a sustained improvement in to the negative economic factors that weigh heavily over the market.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Small sales continue
Mosaic reports sales of small lots of DAP this week into South America at $470/mt FOB Tampa for July shipment.The price tag is at the bottom of the range seen in prior weeks. Substantial movement in the Tampa benchmark in either direction seems dependent on the extent of Brazilian buying in the coming weeks.
US Midwest: Demand over, fill is next concern
With seasonal applications of phosphate over and done with, distributors are looking at replacement costs for summer fill. Mosaic has stuck with its earlier indication of delivered values roughy in line with spot indications to retailers of $460/st FOB.However, the barge market is gaining ground, and it is possible the producer's expected target of $440/st FOB New Orleans plus freight to inland destinations might be possible despite the disappointing spring season. For this to occur the recent jump in corn values based on revisions by the US Department of Agriculture's forecasts will have to hold.
US NOLA: DAP barge quotes benefit from corn gains
Increases in prompt and forward corn prices are getting credit for higher DAP values this week at New Orleans. July barges were no lower than $425/st FOB at the end of the week, with Mosiac material selling at $430/st FOB and a trader sale setting the low end at $420/st FOB. Forward sales are cited at $426-428/st FOB. Offers from traders are creeping over $430/st FOB for August, but buyers have not been willing to support that price tag yet.
The bump in DAP values was creditied mostly to a more positive outlook for corn prices. The June 30 acreage and grain stocks reports generally were supportive of corn and even soybean values. Corn gained as much as $0.30/bushel June 30. However, by mid-day July 1, CME forward contract values through December 2015 were giving back $0.07-0.08/bushel of that gain.
MAP values are holding just $5-1/st above DAP at New Orleans, even though the supply picture for MAP going forward appears to be extremely tight.
US: DAP/MAP inventories building at end of Q1
The January-March 2015 US phosphate producer data recently provided by The Fertilizer Institute show an increase in producers' inventories at the end of Q1. This was likely due to weaker year-over-year demand for DAP and MAP in the US due to fewer corn acres and wet weather that affected crop choices in some areas.
At the end of January - based on 100% of US capacity reporting - producers' DAP/MAP inventories were 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5), up 1% from the close of the previous month, and 28% above end January 2014.
The February data reflected the same trend, with 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5) in producers' inventory at month's end, unchanged on January but up by 24% against February 2014. March 2015 inventories were 582,000 st P2O5 (527,987 mt P2O5), up by 2% on February and by 19% year on year.
Inventory levels for each of the three months were above the monthly production rates of 413,000 st P2O5, 389,000 st P2O5 and 400,000 st P2O5 respectively.
Total production between July-March reached 3.68 million st P2O5 (3.34 million mt P2O5), an increase of 2% compared with the previous year.
US producers' shipments in January of this year were 407,000 st P2O5 (369,208 mt P2O5), 11% less than December 2014 and 14% below January 2014.
February shipments were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt P2O5) 4% less than January 2015 but 7% more than the previous year. March shipments also were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt), even with February of this year but 8% less than March 2014.
During the first nine months of the current US fertilizer year, July-March, US producers' shipments of DAP/MAP were 3.5 million st P2O5 (3.2 million mt P2O5), down 7% from the prior year period.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Argentina: Prices weaken to nearer $500/mt CFR
Recent sales have been concluded in the range of $500-505/mt CFR with current offers said to be even lower. With Brazilian demand far lower than anticipated for the time of year, long positions are beginning to build prompting competitive offers of MAP from most origins , e.g. Australian, Russian and Chinese (YUC granular 11-52-0), into alternative markets.
Brazil: Market stalls and prices stay weak
The market in Brazil remains weak in the low $490s/mt CFR but these prices have not really been tested over the past week. Volumes are thin and demand remains limited. reports also suggest that inventories on the ground are healthy with imports arriving against previous sales and buyers reluctant to risk holding unnecessary stocks in the current economic climate.
The market remains very weak as yet another week goes by with little real demand although some are hoping that the increase in soybean prices this week might prompt some renewed interest.
Some suppliers are still looking to achieve at or above $500/mt CFR but these levels are not workable today with demand so slow. Part cargoes from trader longs are heard sold at significantly lower levels over the past couple of weeks and although sub $490/mt CFR is not currently evident, the market would certainly appear to be nearer $490 than $500/mt CFR today.
Reports indicate that Russian and Australian product is on offer in the low $490s/mt CFR if not lower and Ma'aden has a 40,000 mt cargo for H1 shipment to South America.
YUC is producing granular 11-52-0 in China and is indicating at or above $480/mt CFR which would equate to the low $500s/mt CFR Brazil on a direct sale basis. Eurochem too is indicating $485/mt CFR for new business but this also does not tally with recent or indeed offers being made into Brazil from current trader positions which would equate back to sub $470/mt FOB Baltic.
OCP has made no sales into Brazil during July and is not expected to do much if any volume business there until August if at all this season. Neither demand nor price prompts the normal volumes that OCP would expect to ship into Brazil at this time of year. In June it shipped 200,000 mt MAP/DAP preceded by 200,000 mt MAP/DAP/NPS 12-46-0+7S in May.
Mosaic continues to ship into its own system in Brazil but has not made any new spot sales here for a number of weeks. Based on its latest spot prices at $470 FOB US Gulf range and a freight of $17/mt, it would theoretically be the only major producer in a position to offer into Brazil at a competitive level.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP benefitting from supply constraints
OCP has added to its July line up this week with two additional sales of phosphoric acid comprising 15,000 mt solution to South Africa and 30,000 mt solution to Turkey equating to just over 50,000 mt DAP. Although
granulation has not yet started at the new JPH-1 plant, the phosphoric acid plant has been running for several weeks, some surplus acid could theoretically be made available between now and when the granulation begins towards the end of the quarter.
In the meantime, OCP remains comfortable going through July, as detailed in last week's Fertilizer Week report, with DAP/MAP sales to Turkey, South Africa, Algeria and Europe totalling as much as 210-230,000 mt plus a further 85,000 mt NPKs for Nigeria and other West Africa. The lack of Brazilian demand has been compensated for by the production issues in Tunisia, Jordan and South Africa which have opened up additional outlets for Moroccan DAP/MAP/TSP and acid in markets such as Turkey, South Africa, Europe, Bangladesh and of course India.
As the US NOLA price moves up, the chances of Moroccan tonnes loading in August become more likely.
Saudi: Port data show increase in May exports
The latest estimates indicate Saudi production and export rates close to capacity. Price levels in India for July are under discussion with buyers expecting a level close to $480/mt CFR or just above.
Data for the port of Ras al Khair show exports of fertilizer in May at 264,000 mt, the largest monthly volume for the year to date. Between January-April, monthly exports were mostly in the range of 180-190,000 mt with the exception of February which had dropped to 141,000 mt. Total exports between January-May from Ras al Khair totalled 960,000 mt.
For May, a total of 11 vessels were loaded and the breakdown by country included an estimated 160,000 mt for India, and 30,000 mt for Pakistan.
Total production capacity at MPC's Ras al Khair plant is 250,000 mt DAP/MAP per month.
Official data for June is not yet available but preliminary estimates suggest that around 220,000 mt was loaded last month, as per the table below.
For July, the only Indian shipment to date confirmed is the Kribhco cargo for Ma'aden loading in the last week. The price is not yet agreed and is currently under discussion. Further Saudi tonnes are expected for July from both Sabic and Ma'aden against agreements with Zuari, Chambal and IFFCO. As such production rates and exports are expected to remain close to capacity.
Price levels in India are still believed to be in the very low $480s/mt CFR for Saudi tonnes while in Pakistan recent sales have been in the mid $480s/mt CFR.
Tunisia: La Skhira restarts but not Gabes
Production has resumed at the TIFERT phosphoric acid plant at La Skhira but DAP production remains suspended at Gabes. Protestors have been blocking the railway lines into Gabes over the past month with a continual sit-in and as such the plant is unable to receive a regular supply of phosphate rock.
With a return to business at La Skhira, phosphoric acid shipments to the two Indian joint venture partners, GSFC and CIL, can be resumed for Q3. Shipments to date this year for India have been extremely limited due to the renewed problems to beset the industry since December 2014.
Meanwhile GCT has no DAP availability for its regular Q3 customers, namely Turkey and southern Europe. OCP has already stepped in to cover part of the shortfall from Tunisia for the Turkish market, specifically to supply Gubretas with 100,000 mt in July. If GCT's plant can start production over the coming weeks, Turkey and Europe, specifially southern Europe, will be the priorities.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: CIL books 50,000 mt Wengfu DAP for July
CIL purchased 50,000 mt DAP for July shipment direct from Wengfu, with the buyer claiming a price below $475/mt CFR. Neither of the two 50,000 mt cargoes required by CIL for August shipment has yet been booked. Trader offers meanwhile remain at higher prices, at or above $480s/mt CFR.
Against its enquiry of June 24 for 65,000 mt DAP and 35,000 mt NPK 10-26-26, Deepak received around 8 offers for the DAP mostly in the range of $480-485/mt CFR. Deepak subsequently countered at $475/mt CFR but as yet has not agreed any tonnes.
Against its tender of June 22 for 75,000 mt DAP for 1H August shipment, RCF has not yet made an award but is expected to make its next move by the end of the week. As already reported, it received six offers with the lowest submitted by Wilson International, backed by Yidu Xingfa, on 35,000 mt for shipment into Gangavaram at $483.00/mt CFR. MMTC, backed by Hubei Chuxing offered the next lowest for Gangavaram or Mundra, at seller's option, at $483.95 or $484.95 respectively. Rare Earth backed by YunnanHonxing, offered the lowest price for delivery to Mundra at $485.80/mt CFR.
The trader offers of around $483-484.00 into India equate back to between $468-470/mt FOB China depending on freight but exclude any trader's margin and provision for hedging. When taking these additional costs into account, the netback is closer to the $460/mt FOB China level.
Recent reported sales at the $478/mt CFR India level or lower are for panamax sales and generally concluded direct, i.e. without the need for any trader margin, thereby giving a netback in the low/mid $460s/mt FOB. These direct sales have proved more attractive not just to the suppliers but to the bigger buyers who are able to reap the benefits offered in the form of lower landed prices.
Any movement in the rupee will continue to have a direct impact on landed prices to India. Having crept above 64.2 against the rupee mid June, it has since settled back at around 63.6, bringing some relief to importers faced with the prospect of eroding margins once again.
Monsoon: Another positive factor to start the month with has been the level of June rainfall despite falling from a high of 28% above the LPA (Long Period Average), but still ending the month some 13% above. The heavy rains seen across much of the country have boosted reservoir levels that had been comparatively low from last year, in some cases to levels above the 10-year average, an extremely significant development going forward and for the Rabi season, should the monsoon fail to perform through Q3.
June rains account for just 18% of the average monsoon rainfall with July and August accounting for 33% and 29% respectively and the balance falling in September. Therefore even though the heavy June rains have encouraged a robust level of Kharif planting (up by 23% yoy as of last week) and boosted water levels, it is the coming weeks that will be the most crucial.
India: RCF opens price offers
RCF has opened price offers against its tender of June 22 for 75,000 mt DAP for H1 August shipment in two lots, 40,000 mt to Mundra, WCI and 35,000 mt to Gangavaram, ECI.
Price offers were as follows:
Pakistan: Data show need for 650,000 mt more DAP
Latest NFDC data show both P2O5 and DAP consumption for May recorded at a high of 68,000 mt P2O5 and 110,000 mt product respectively. Off-take for the first two months of the Kharif season, April-May, has been extremely positive with a 20% year-on-year increase in P2O5 usage and a 17% increase in DAP. DAP sales were also 57% higher than the four-year average for this period.
As such the NFDC has revised up its consumption estimate for the Kharif season to 629,000 mt, up from last month's estimate of 618,000 mt.
The latest NFDC report suggests a sizeable shortfall in imports for the current season but only takes into account those imports that have actually arrived into the country during April/May. The real import volume is much higher as documented over the past few weeks in Fertilizer Week and currently stands at an estimated 440,000 mt for the calendar year of which 83,000 mt is included in the opening balance and a further 65,000 mt as arrivals in April/May. Almost 300,000 mt has been booked for June/July shipment and hence added to the table below.
Overall consumption of DAP looking robust for the year and, barring any unforeseen negative variables, is expected to reach last year's volume of 1.7 million mt which necessitated imports of around 1.1 million
mt. Therefore we can expect a similar volume of imports for this year, prompting a requirement for up to 600- 650,000 mt to arrive before the end of this calendar year.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Vietnam: Market dominated by YUC material
The DAP market has been dominated by cross border sales of YUC green product priced below the CFR equivalent of $500/mt CFR HCM in bags. As such there is no interest in product from other origins either in or outside China.
Farmers prefer to buy the green or natural DAP from YUC, and if this is currently in the market, there is little interest in any other type of DAP. Even if at the same price as darker coloured DAP from China, (once favoured by the market) farmers seemingly will opt for the YUC product.
The netback on the YUC DAP is said to be around the low/mid-$470s/mt FOB China, but sales are concluded on a cross-border basis and as such are in extremely small lots.
China: Two-tier market in China as industry gets competitive
Wengfu's sale of a July panamax, allegedly in the mid $470s/mt CFR India would netback into the low/mid $460s/mt FOB China, well within the current price range as reported in Fertilizer Week. Panamax rates to India EC are close to $10/mt but this sale is for a 2 port discharge suggesting a slightly higher rate. A two-tier market is developing in India with Chinese product as traders struggle to compete with sales being concluded direct by the producers.
Over the past couple of weeks, trader offers of Chinese DAP into India appear to have been consistently higher than offers and indeed sales concluded by the producers who have sold direct to the buyer. Prices in recent Indian tenders have been at or above $480/mt CFR while sales of panaxes by the larger suppliers have been concluded in the upper $470s or potentially lower in the case of CIL's purchase. Traders are faced with limited margins and a more competitive stance from the industry.
Most recent sales to India have been concluded in the mid $460s/mt FOB China. There have been some sales of YUC DAP into Vietnam reported in the low $470s/mt FOB but these would appear to be cross
border tonnes sold in very small parcels and not large enough to be reflected in Fertilizer Week's price range.
YUC is producing gMAP 11-52-0 at its Tian'an Chemical plant, formerly known as Furui. It is currently producing the MAP on its two DAP trains but will switch back to DAP if demand does not support further production runs. The plant has an annual capacity for 600,000 mt DAP equating to around 50,000 mt per month. A price of $480/mt FOB or higher has been indicated for the 11-52-0 which would equate to the
low $500smt CFR Brazil and higher if including trader's margin. Current price ideas are in the $490s/mt CFR Brazil for 11-52-0 with limited demand.
Price indications for granular 11-44-0 for late July are nearer the $365/mt FOB level and remaining weak, reflecting waning demand from Brazilian buyers all too aware of time constraints in shipping product from China after mid July.
The phosphate industry will be maximising export sales, particulalry for DAP, between now and mid-August when demand from the domestic season will start to pick up to build supplies for the autumn season.
Rain has been an issue in China in recent weeks. According to Martell Crop Projections the North-Eastern province of Heilongjiang, responsible for around 18% of China's corn production, heavy rain that began in May has intensified through June, with rainfall at 150-200% of normal levels. This is said to have hampered corn planting and therefore DAP, NPK and urea consumption are all likely to be impacted.
PHOSPHORIC ACID
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: Talks underway on NW European Q3 acid contracts
OCP is currently negotiating Q3 phosacid contracts with its customers in NW Europe and hopes to finalise prices by next week. It is looking for an increase on the back of its recent $5/mt P2O5 increase achieved last week in India for Q3 and Q4.
To justify a further increase in Europe, OCP is citing a tight market, prompted by production constraints in Tunisia and South Africa.
OCP also reports two new sales of phosphoric acid with 30,000 mt solution to Turkey and 15,000 mt solution for South Africa, both for July shipment. The price was not disclosed.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: July arrivals not yet deterred by higher price
Close to 80,000 mt phosphoric acid solution is arriving into India during 1st week July with volumes boosted by a Senegalese cargo and another thought to originate from JIFCO/Jordan, both for IFFCO. The TIFERT
joint venture plant in Tunisia has resumed production after a two month stoppage and cargoes for CIL and GSFC should materialise from August if not before.
PHOSPHATE ROCK
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Rock import demand expected steady through Q3
Rock imports continue at a steady pace supported by more attractive production costs from the imported rock/sulphur route compared with imported phosphoric acid, particularly given the recent increase, albeit nominal, in acid prices for H2.
Even though sulphur prices have also edged up, the price differential remains relatively wide between the two production routes and as such, demand for rock should remain healthy through Q3.
NP/NPKS
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan: NPK imports down January-May
Japan imported 37,500 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 22% fall on the same period in 2014 and the lowest level for this period since 1997, according to GTIS.
During the period, South Korean imports from Namhae fell 42% to 19,000 mt while imports from Chinese NPK producers increased 49% to 13,500 mt.
The country imported just 4,000 mt of NPKs in May, with around half coming from Namhae.
SE Asia: NPK prices slightly lower with market out of season
Southeast Asian NPK 16-16-16 prices are seen at $395-415/mt CFR this week as a seasonal lull in demand and stiff competition lowers price levels.
In Thailand, prices are quoted in the $395-405/mt CFR range with prices in the other markets closer to the upper end of the SE Asian range, nearer $415/mt CFR.
Thailand imported 415,928 mt NPKs between January and May, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. During the period, Thailand imported 275,000 mt from Russia and 124,000 mt from Yara.
Imports were very low until May, when Thailand imported 110,000 mt compared with 26,000 mt a year previously. During May this year, Thailand imported around 50,000 mt each from Russian producers and from Yara.
