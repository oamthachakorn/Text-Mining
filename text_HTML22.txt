Market summary
Mosaic takes the lead on production cuts
Prices remain under pressure in all regions. In response US producer Mosaic has cut production for Q1 by 400,000t DAP/ MAP in an attempt to bring some balance to the market. OCP is tailoring output to demand and Sabic has pushed back its 2H February availability to March but Chinese producers look unlikely to cut back further. Neither will PhosAgro. On prices GCT DAP has been sold in Turkey below $380/t fob
(a drop of $40/t in a week). Indian demand is non-existent with the DoF stopping movement of DAP from the ports. Southeast Asian cfr prices now reflect the $360s/t fob China. In Latin America, Brazilian MAP cfr levels head towards the $320s/t cfr.
Outlook: yet to bottom out

February 2016 DAP/MAP/NPK commitments - main producers
Subscriber note
Argus is proposes to make changes in the way some prices are assessed and to introduce new assessments, as follows:
DAP Baltic/Black Sea fob – this currently includes DAP of Lithuanian and Russian origin in the assessment. However, duty on Russian DAP was raised from 3pc to 6.5pc on ship- ments to the EU (Lithuanian product is duty free) which has lowered the resultant netback on Russian DAP and widened the range considerably. Argus FMB proposes to introduce a Lithuanian DAP fob price and a Russian DAP fob price.
DAP US Gulf domestic barge $/st – it is proposed the name of this assessment is changed to DAP Nola barge fob $/st. This is to clarify that the assessment has always included DAP of all origins, not just domestically produced material, as implied by the name.
DAP Central Florida railcar $/st – due to a lack of liquid- ity it is proposed that this assessment is dropped from the weekly phosphates report and the North American Fertilizer report.
DAP India (contract) cfr – as prices are mostly agreed on a spot basis it is proposed to rename the assessment to DAP India cfr.
New price quotes:
China MAP 11-44, 10-50 and 11-52 fob - due to liquidity and volumes traded (especially to Brazil) following the in- troduction of a flat rate export tax at the beginning of 2015 it is proposed to introduce these new assessments.
DAP southeast Asia cfr – predominantly relating to Viet- nam and Thailand DAP markets which collectively account for around 1mn t/year DAP imports, or approximately 7pc of global DAP trade.
Argus will accept comments on these changes up to Friday 26 February. To discuss comments on this proposal, please contact Mike Nash at mike.nash@argusmedia.com or 44 207 199 5699. Formal comments should be marked as such and may be submitted via e-mail to mike.nash@argusmedia.com or by post to Mike Nash, Argus Media Ltd, 175 St John Street, London EC1V 4LW, United Kingdom and received by 26 Feb- ruary. Please note, formal comments will be published after the consultation period unless confidentiality is specifically requested.
Market analysis
Mosaic leads charge to rebalance market
The market is to some extent still reeling from the signifi- cant price falls seen last week which wiped 10pc off the cfr values in Latin America. Latin American prices have contin- ued to fall (although by much less this week) as traders sell remaining lots from January vessels. In Argentina, MAP has traded at $335/t cfr with $325/t cfr widely reported done in Brazil. India is full of product and southeast Asian demand is lacklustre. Meanwhile in Europe, GCT has seen DAP prices fall to below $380/t fob on latest business in Turkey.
With DAP/MAP prices plummeting in Latin America, it came as little surprise that a supply side response would ensue. Mosaic has taken the lead by announcing it will cut phos- phate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shut- downs in the first quarter of 2016. Assuming these cuts are fully realized, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic's quarterly finished phosphate production capacity.
The cuts amount to a loss of around 200,000t DAP/MAP in February and March assuming the cuts began at the begin- ning of February. The likely response will be a reaction in the domestic price, but Mosaic faces a delicate balancing act. On the one hand it wants to shore up the price for phosphates, but on the other it wants to protect domestic market share. Cutting production runs the risk of encourag-

ing more DAP/MAP imports from Russia and Morocco. Mosaic will thus doubtless be hoping other producers follow suit.
The question is who will follow Mosaic's lead? The US is not the global phosphates superpower it once was, its mantle taken by Morocco and China, so this announcement in itself will not be enough to balance the market.
Clearly the hope among 'traditional' suppliers is that high- cost producers, speciﬁcally the Chinese, will have to exit the market in the face of lower prices (PhosAgro CEO Andrey Guryev has apparently said as much this week). But in reality it is not so simple. In China, the consensus is that, despite falling fob levels and a decidedly uncertain domestic market outlook (inventories are reported to be high), producers will not cut back as heavily as some hope - Chinese producers need cash ﬂow and the preservation of market share. Dis- cussions have apparently generated more heat than light and the reality of a concerted producer-wide uniform production cut is complex to achieve and quite possibly unlikely.
The problem is that Indian subcontinent and southeast Asian demand (which would absorb Chinese product) is paltry. There is little doubt Indian DAP import demand for the rest of Q1 will be negligible. Argus FMB understands the DoF has effectively banned the movement of DAP/NPKs from the ports inland. This will hinder further importation dur- ing February and March. India is a) full of product and b) mindful that further trades exposing ever lower cfr prices to the market will garner the attention of the authorities keen to cut the subsidy next fertilizer year. Asian demand is dead aside from a 3,000t DAP inquiry reported in Korea and some miniscule buying in Malaysia. Buyers are bidding in the $360s/t cfr in Vietnam and even Thailand. Traders are short- ing the market, but the price is a constantly moving target.
Andrey Guryev, the CEO of PhosAgro, appears to have dis- tanced the company from production cuts, opting for greater focus on complex fertilizer production and domestic market shipments.
And what of OCP? To some it was ironic that Mosaic an- nounced its cut back the same week that OCP inaugurated its new 1mn t/year DAP/MAP/NPK plant (dedicated for the African market) at Jorf Lasfar. In reality, this plant had already been running for some while so the demand/supply balance has not changed overnight. More important is at what level OCP is running its other plants. Based on current commitments at a shade over 200,000t DAP/MAP/NPKs for February and a monthly capacity of close to 600,000t, OCP
is clearly tailoring output to demand and will not chase busi- ness at lower levels in Brazil or even Europe.
Fundamentally there is no demand of note anywhere in the world. This situation will continue for at least three weeks, and possibly longer until more Latin American demand emerges, the US domestic season gets underway and we have a better idea of how the Chinese domestic market is shaping up. In the meantime, producers will hope that the supply side curtailments do the trick.

FMB Spot Sales Selection - 4 February 2016
North America
US
Mosaic has not made any DAP/MAP export sales this week and reiterates that it does not countenance making lower offers into Latin America given current cfr values there.
Mosaic will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. Assum- ing these cuts are fully realized, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic's quarterly finished phosphate production capac- ity. Mosaic produced 2.4mn t of finished phosphates in the third quarter of 2015, representing 83pc of its operational capacity. The company releases fourth quarter and full-year figures on 11 February.
"The long-term positive outlook for phosphates has not changed, but we are adjusting our production levels to match immediate demand and manage our margins," Mosaic chief executive Joc O'Rourke said.
the phosphates world this week
The company said the curtailment is in response to cur- rent crop nutrient market conditions. US DAP export prices have dropped steadily since September 2015, going from the mid-$450s/t fob Tampa to $380-$385/t fob as of last week because of decreasing global demand, particular in Brazil and Latin America.
Mosaic's phosphate feedstock costs have dropped sharply as well. The February Tampa ammonia contract fell by $40/t from January to a six-year low of $310/t cfr. The first quarter molten sulphur contract settled down $15/lt to $95/lt deliv- ered to its lowest point since the fourth quarter of 2013.
The prospect of lowered US farm incomes and an unfavour- able outlook for crop prices have many farmers deferring fertilizer orders until the last minute. However, Mosaic believes prices are at a level that will inspire a rebound in demand.

January-March 2016 phosphate tenders
"With the recent price volatility and decline in raw mate- rial costs, buyers appear to be delaying purchases. This is lengthening the seasonal period of weak demand," Mosaic senior vice president of commercial operations Rick McLel- lan said. "Today's crop nutrient prices, including phosphates, are attractive to farmers globally and we expect a strong demand response after this seasonally slow period."
US domestic
The domestic phosphates market held mostly steady this week with buyers and sellers relatively inactive for most of the week with limited physical trading taking place. Howev- er, Mosaic’s announcement on 3 February regarding produc- tion cuts caused a knee-jerk reaction in the market and motivated traders to move product as several barge trades were confirmed.
The DAP barge price rose by $5/st at the top end to $315- 335/st fob Nola on moderate trade. The bottom end was underpinned by a confirmed trade late last Thursday for a February-loading open origin DAP barge. The high end was underpinned by confirmed a trade by Mosaic. Two barges of domestic DAP trade were confirmed at the $320-325/st fob Nola range. Indeed the majority of trade this week was confirmed at the $315-325/st fob Nola range.
Central and Latin America
Mexico
Mexican phosphate producer Fertinal confirmed that it has been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes, a subsidiary of the state-owned company.
"Today is time for a change of control, we confirm that Fertinal has officially been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes," Fertinal said in a letter to stakeholders and customers. "This
acquisition will bring new opportunities for Fertinal due to the vertical integration of this Group in the chain production of gas–ammonia–fertilizer; this will allow Grupo Fertinal to become a low cost producer and a stronger competitor."
The acquisition has been made official after Pemex reached an agreement to take over Fertinal in December.
Fertinal, Mexico's lone phosphate producer, had endured cash flow issues over the past two years because of a series of operational setbacks, combined with falling global phos- phate prices. The company's phosphate rock mine in Baja California Sur, Mexico, was impacted by a hurricane and a fire in late 2014, which decreased production.
Mexican DAP exports reached 11,000t in November accord- ing to GTIS data, mostly destined for Argentina. Year-to-date exports reached 138,000t, down 7pc. The main recipients were Argentina with 41,000t (compared to almost zero in 2014), Chile with 36,000t (down a quarter) and Australia with 20,000t (down by nearly half).
Mexican DAP imports for January-November were 247,000t, down 16pc yaer on year. The US share declined by 25pc to 191,000t but Chinese shipments rose 39pc to 55,000t. No- vember imports hit 21,000t, sourced mostly from the US.
Mexican MAP imports totalled 114,000t in January-November according to GTIS, a drop of 21pc. These comprised 40,000t from the US (a rise of 5pc) and 40,000t from China (down 40pc). Australian shipments were 16,000t, down 50pc. No- vember shipments were just 3,000t mostly sourced from the US.
MAP exports reached 263,000t in the first 11 months of last year. This was down by 27pc. 105,000t went to Australia (a
Licensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP
decline of a third) and 76,000t to Chile (down 13pc). Argen- tina took 58,000t but there was a large drop off in ship- ments to the US. November shipments were 25,000t, mostly to Argentina.
Colombia
January-November DAP imports reached 160,000t approxi- mately according to latest GTIS data. This was a rise of 13pc. The US saw shipments rise 7pc to 135,000t with Chinese DAP tonnage growing 105pc to 20,000t.
November imports reached 13,000t, mainly sourced from the US.
MAP imports for the first 11 months totalled 144,000t, up 2pc year on year. 124,000t were sourced from the US (down 3pc) and 17,000t from China (up 110pc). November imports were 9,855t, mainly sourced from the US.
Brazil
A January-loading cargo of MAP has been sold by a trader at $330/t cfr Paranagua. There are additionally reports of further sales this week at $325/t cfr for February shipment. Demand is lacklustre.
Weak demand has restrained business for lower grade MAP. Notional indications for Chinese MAP 10-50-0 are at $300- 315/t cfr and $270-285/t cfr for MAP 11-44-0.
Argentina/Uruguay
Nitron is reported to have sold 6,500t Russian MAP to Argen- tina/Uruguay at $335/t cfr from a January loader. Bids are now down to $325/t cfr. Generally importers report offers around $340/t cfr. To date, it is estimated that Argentina has booked around 150,000t DAP/MAP for January-February arrival. With the winter planting season beginning in May, further buying may be opportunistic or if importers believe a market floor has been reached.
Europe and former Soviet Union
Russia
EuroChem will ship 70,000-75,000t Lifosa DAP to Europe this month priced around $425/t cfr reflecting roughly $410/t fob Baltic.
At Kingisepp, output will be 60,000t split 50:50 into DAP and MAP. Some 5,000-10,000t is in the line-up for domestic consumption. A further 40,000t is on offer.
PhosAgro CEO Andrey Guryev has made the following market comment:
“In the current challenging market conditions we see phosphate-based fertilizer producers becoming more disci- plined at optimising production output in response to shifts in demand, and this is a perfectly healthy tendency.
“I think that the market is nearing the bottom, and initia- tives like curtailing production will help to clear out excess stocks. This will naturally affect demand ahead of the spring planting season, helping buyers be confident that they can enter a stable fertilizer market without concern that prices may fall further.
“In terms of demand for the spring planting season, our portfolio of orders consists primarily of complex fertilizers that are ready for direct application by end customers and are not blended like DAP or MAP. We intend to stick to our plan of increasing production capacities for complex fertil- izers, which are sold to high-margin markets and will not put pressure on prices for concentrated phosphate fertilizers.
“We are particularly focussed on increasing our sales of complex fertilizers and NPS in our priority domestic and regional markets.”
It thus seems clear that PhosAgro will not be curtailing

Argus completes and extends annual Iosco assurance review
Argus has completed its fourth external assurance review of its price benchmarks, extending the scope of the process to cover petrochemicals and fertilizers for the first time, as well as again covering crude, products, biofuels, thermal coal, coking coal, natural gas and biomass benchmarks. The review was carried out by professional services firm PwC. Annual independent, external reviews of oil benchmarks are required by international regulatory group Iosco’s Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies, and Iosco encourages extension of the reviews to non-oil benchmarks.

production of phosphate fertilizers but will limit exposure to deep sea, volatile markets, preferring instead to concentrate on higher margin NPS/NPKs for sale in markets closer to home. PhosAgro is understood to be moving around 150,000t to the domestic/regional sector this month.
UralChem's 2015 production shows a healthy increase in complex fertilizer production of 18pc to 617,000t versus the previous year. MAP production rose 150pc to 104,000t as rock supply was restored to Voskressensk.
Russian DAP exports rose by 107pc during January-November 2015 to 1.1mn t. The main cause of the rise was the re- establishment of DAP exports to India with close to 350,000t shipped. A further 127,000t were shipped to Estonia (for onward shipment for export) and there was an 88pc rise in exports to the US to 127,000t. France and Belgium col- lectively took almost 200,000t during the period (a rise of 196pc and 283pc respectively).
November exports of DAP totalled 29,000t, mostly destined for the US and Belarus.
Russia exported 1.784mn t MAP in the first 11 months of 2015 according to GTIS data. This was a rise of 2pc. The main recipients were Brazil with 468,000t, down a third, and Estonia (for onward exportation) with 380,000t (up 4pc). The US was the fastest-growing major market, taking 299,000t, a rise of 286pc. A further 108,000t was shipped to Belarus and 102,000t to the Ukraine.
November exports were 74,000t, comprising 24,000t to Esto- nia, 15,000t to Azerbaijan and 9,000t to Lithuania.
France
DAP prices have corrected downwards this week by around €15/t, with offers sinking to €380-385/t fca Rouen. This is down from €395-400/t fca in late January. Suppliers, keen to get orders, are fighting for market share. The drop in price
Issue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016
has however come too late to be of much use this season as raw materials demand for blending have largely been covered.
Belgium
DAP prices have continued to fall, losing €15-20/t since end- January. Offers were reported at €380-385/t fca or $420- 425/t fca Benelux ports this week. Buying interest, however, was extremely low as blenders are well-stocked for the time being. New buying is not expected until April/May for the corn application season.
Netherlands
Offers of DAP have dropped dramatically again following falls in the international market. DAP offers in Benelux ports have fallen by a further $5-10/t to $420-425/t fca.
Germany
DAP prices are indicated slightly lower this week at $420- 425/t fca but there has been no firm business and prices are only indicative. Some market players believe that prices sub- $420/t fca may be achievable in this current environment. Material is not required for application until April, although bulk blenders will need product slightly earlier so there is still time to buy. Moreover, weak international DAP prices are keeping buyers on the sidelines, uncertain of the right moment to step in.
Spain
There are a wide range of price indications across Spain. In the south indications range €420-440/t fca/ex-warehouse, with certain importers trying to keep levels towards the high end based on the expensive stock being held.
But in the north, DAP is available at €435-440/t delivered basis supplies in Bayonne, France. This would reflect nearer €415-425/t fca. There are also indications around €400/t fas duty paid, ex-Russia.

There is minimal DAP demand in the domestic market, partly because of the time of year and also because of falling prices.
Fertiberia has withdrawn its list prices, awaiting firm demand. It has no further imports lined up for February from OCP at this stage, and is instead focused on liquidating stocks.
Italy
The market is slipping slightly with DAP at €450-455/t fca, equivalent to about $460-465/t cfr with the euro at 1.1. Im- porters were targeting $390-400/t fob north Africa for fresh shipments, with reports GCT was offering at $415/t fob. OCP maintains it will not sell below $435/t fob.
Africa and Middle East
Morocco
OCP has not made any new sales this week. It maintains
$435/t fob in Mediterranean/European markets. With Brazil weak it will not ship phosphates there in February.
In short, OCP will tailor output to demand. Its commitments comprise:
50,000t NPKs for Ethiopia
120,000t DAP/NPKs for west coast Africa 20,000t DAP Turkey
25,000t DAP for domestic market
20,000-30,000t DAP allocation for Europe TOTAL: 215,000t
With an estimated capacity of 580,000t/month DAP/MAP, OCP is running at reduced rates.
Tunisia
GCT has begun to shore up its February DAP export line up with 15,000t sold to traditional outlet Turkey, albeit at lower prices.

Kandla 
GCT has sold 10,000t to Gemlik in the high-$370s/t fob and another 5,000t to a distributor at $380/t fob. Argus FMB last assessed the Tunisian price notionally in the $420s/t fob basis netbacks in Mediterranean markets.
Saudi Arabia
The Sabic weekly phosphates update reports that it has postponed its availability to the beginning of the March due to slow demand. The asking price idea is now in the $370s/t fob.
South Africa
South African MAP imports reached 261,000t in 2015 ac- cording to GTIS data. This was a rise of 53pc. 88,000t was sourced from Russia, up 352pc, 72,000t from Saudi Arabia (up 163pc) and 65,000t from OCP Morocco.
MAP exports totalled 94,000t, a rise of 94pc year on year. This comprised 33,000t to Brazil, 31,000t to Zambia and 29,000t to Zimbabwe. Around 8,000t MAP was exported in December, mainly to Zambia and Zimbabwe.
high level of DAP and NPK stocks b) cessation of the move- ment of DAP stocks from the port and c) concern that ever lower priced transactions will highlight the price erosion and make it difficult to oppose a significant cut to the DAP subsidy for 2016-17.
Argus FMB understands that the Indian Department of Fertil- izers (DoF) has stopped the movement of imported DAP, NPK and MOP during February-March 2016. No formal notification has been issued, however.
The consequence is that DAP and MOP lying at the ports or warehouses in the country cannot be sold and transported into the interior.
It is further reported that the DoF will monitor the move- ment of domestic production. This will effectively reduce import demand for DAP, NPK and MOP to nil till end March.
Unsold stock of imported DAP, MOP and NPK lying at ports and warehouses will be subject to the new (likely reduced) subsidy which will be announced in early Q2 for the 2016-17 fertilizer year.
Indian subcontinent
India
Indian DAP offers have reportedly fallen to the $370s/t cfr but India is not ready to buy more imports.
The Indian Punjab Markfed inquiry for 80,000t DAP for April-May shipment received the lowest offers from IPL at Rs 21,400/t ($314/t) delivered with with 120 days' credit and Hindalco at Rs 21,390/t with 90 days' credit.

fertilizer year, with 140,000t arriving in January but just 15,000t so far in February.
With DAP arrivals thinning, port stocks have halved in the last week to 61,821t, down from the 120,821t reported last week.
DAP port stocks comprised: Kandla - 3,197t
Mundra - 32,624t Vizag - 22,000t
Gangavaram - 2,000t Kakinada - 2,000t TOTAL: 61,821t
Pakistan
Demand remains extremely subdued on high DAP stocks. One importer said it was sitting on enough stocks to last 1H 2016.
It is also reported that shipments across the Afghan border have slowed, in turn adding to stock pressure in the country.
Bangladesh
There are reports that Ma’aden’s supply deal with Ban- gladesh’s Ministry of Agriculture/Bangladeshi Agriculture Development Corporation for 150,000t of DAP is split 75,000t firm and 75,000t optional tonnage. Three cargoes of 25,000t each will ship in April, September and October under the firm contract.
Bangladesh will look to tender its annual fertilizer imports quota in May 2016. Reports suggest it might be in the market for 250,000t of TSP, 450,000t of DAP and 250,000t of MOP.
East Asia and Oceania
China
Traders are attempting to short the DAP market with prices falling with offers into southeast Asia netting now in the $360s/t fob and seasoned observers think this is possible. There has been no export business of note this week in the run up to Chinese New Year. All signs are that YUC remains the only pro- ducer of note to be actively cutting back on production. Yihua has confirmed it is still running at normal rates.
Producers are hoping for a ramp up in demand after the holiday period in the domestic season but stocks are high as much product has been moved on consignment and traders doubt the domestic market can absorb much more.
China domestic
The domestic DAP/MAP markets were unchanged this week with demand from both the agricultural sector and the NPK industries still weak.
The decline in the sulphur market is one of the major fac- tors to affect the domestic phosphate market. The con- tinuing fall in the international market could mean further decreases in the production cost for phosphates. This is unlikely to affect the spring market because production has already been fed with enough spot sulphur in producers’ warehouses. But this will affect distributors. They might purchase less to avoid losses after the spring application season.
The mainstream offer price in the southwest is still at RMB 2,900/t northeast delivered, equivalent to RMB2,550/t ex- works. The mainstream offer price in Hubei is at RMB2,500/t ex-works. The mainstream offer price of 55pc prills is still RMB1,850-1,950/t ex-works in the southwest and around RMB1,950-2,000/t ex-works in Hubei.
Malaysia
The National Farmers Organisation (NAFAS) is reported to have bought 3,000t 17.7-46 DAP around $380/t cfr although some reports put the figure in the low/mid-$370s/t cfr. This is thought to be via a regional trader. Last DAP trades in the region for 18-46 DAP were in the high-$380s/t cfr Thailand. Overall liquidity in the southeast Asian markets is very thin.
Korea
Chobi Co is reported to be in the market for 3,000t DAP.
Philippines
There are unconfirmed reports of interest in a 6,000t DAP lot supposedly under discussion in the low-$360s/t cfr for 17.5-46 DAP.
Thailand
Traders are offering short into Thailand below $380/t cfr but bids are now at $375/t cfr with reports late this week of bids falling lower. Interest is sporadic.
Vietnam
Bids for DAP are in the high-$360s/t cfr.
Japan
Japanese DAP imports rose marginally for 2015 according to latest GTIS data, by 2.3pc to 367,200t.

US-sourced DAP to Chinese material. China saw its shipments rise by a quarter to 197,000t for the year while US exports fell 16pc to 130,000t. Saudi DAP supplies rose marginally by 2pc to 31,000t.
The trend partly reflects China's rise as the pre-eminent global DAP supplier, particularly in the southeast Asian, re- gion following its adoption of a flat export tax allowing ship- ments all year round. US production and exports continue to erode marginally on environmental concerns over phosphate rock mining, as well as greater emphasis on regional and domestic markets for US producers and a switch to manufac- ture of other phosphate products.
Japanese December DAP imports stood at 27,960t, compris- ing around 10,000t from China, 10,000t from Saudi Arabia and 8,000t from the US.
New Zealand
Imports of both DAP and MAP fertilizer to New Zealand fell in 2015 according to latest GTIS data.
Full year 2015 DAP imports were down by a fifth to 237,642t. There was a noticeable change in the make up of the im- port origins with Chinese DAP shipments rising by 21pc to 183,000t as it consolidated its position as the main supplier in the southeast Asian region. US shipments rose significantly to 46,000t from zero in 2014. The drop was on account of less Australian cargoes coming in, where tonnage dropped by over 50,000t to just 7,000t.
December DAP imports reached 44,976t, all sourced from China.
MAP imports for the year fell by 41pc to 220,000t, with 140,000t sourced from China, itself a fall of 47pc. December saw 18,000t shipped from China.
TSP
Sri Lanka
Sri Lankan importer Agstar is understood to be in the market for 4,000t TSP.
The previous CIC inquiry for 6,000t TSP is understood to have been awarded to a trader around $300/t cfr with 180 days' credit.
Sri Lanka imported 102,000t TSP in the whole of 2015 ac- cording to GTIS statistics, a rise of 8pc year on year. Almost all product was sourced from China.
Belgium
TSP prices have remained stable because of less competi- tion in the market. Offers remain at €355/t fca Ghent for imported TSP and at €365/t ex-works Amsterdam.
Netherlands
TSP prices have stayed steady this week at between €355- 360/t fca ex-warehouse Ghent. Amfert TSP remains on offer at €365/t ex-works Amsterdam.
NPK
China
The domestic NPK market did not change this week with demand still weak and operating rates low. Many small NPK producers are said to have stopped production as their work- force has left for the holiday season. With the NPK market essentially in hibernation since the end of the autumn sea- son in 2015, it is estimated that the NPK stock is lower than normal. Hence when the application season comes, there might be a problem in NPK supply in some areas. However, it is doubtful that the NPK supply will be short because the low urea price might attract farmers to use more urea and less NPK in the spring application season.
The mainstream offer price of 15-15-15 CL stabilized at around RMB2,000/t ex-works and that of 15-15-15 S at around RMB2,250/t ex-works.
Belgium
There is zero interest in complex fertilizers at present. How- ever, buyers are well aware of the latest falls in urea, DAP and potash and this is bound to pressure NPK prices lower once re-stocking begins. Last prices of imported 15-15-15 were at €325/t fca ex-store with local product offered at €335/t cif inland.
Germany
There is little interest in NPKs at the moment. The price of 15-15-15 continues to be indicated at €335-340/t cif inland. Polish 15-15-15 is offered within this range. Some buying is expected to emerge March/early April for spring application.
PhosAgro is understood to have recently delivered a small parcel of 15-15-15 and NP 20-20-0 to Germany.
Italy
15-15-15 prices have fallen to €340-345/t fca, equivalent to the mid- $340s/t cfr.

Phosphate rock
India
Jordanian producer JPMC has agreed to supply 500,000t of 73-75pc BPL phosphate rock to Indian buyers GNFC, Gujarat Alkalies, Aditya Birla and Hindalco at $120/t fob for January- May 2016 shipment.
This represents a drop of $10/t from the fourth quarter of 2015.
Negotiations for Q1 68-70pc BPL phosphate rock contracts continue.
Company News
Anglo American’s Brazil fertilizer sales fall
London-listed mining group Anglo American's phosphate sales in Brazil dropped by a third in October-December to 194,400t, compared with a year earlier.
Brazilian fertilizer demand declined over the past year because of weak crop prices and tighter credit supply to Brazilian farmers.
Anglo American owns three phosphate assets in Brazil — the Ouvidor plant that produces phosphate rock, and the Cata- lao and Cubatao mines.
The company's phosphate production rose by 6pc on the year to 303,400t in the fourth quarter. It's full-year out- put of 1.1mn t was unchanged from 2014. Phosphoric acid output dropped by 19pc on the year to 63,900t in the fourth quarter, and was down by 10pc at 265,100t for the full year. "Phosphoric acid production decreased by 19pc mainly due to maintenance activities," the company said.
Anglo American said in December that it wanted to sell its phosphate and niobium business in 2016.
PhosAgro calls 2015 ‘challenging’
Russian fertilizer producer PhosAgro called 2015 a "challeng- ing" year as it posted a dip in sales of most products, barring phosphate-based fertilizers.
Urea sales fell by 6.6pc to 949,400t from 1.01mn t in 2014. NP sales fell to nil from 120,300t in 2014.
Ammonia-based fertilizer sales fell by 82.2pc to 6,100t; phosphoric acid sales fell by 20.3pc to 41,100t, while sulph- uric acid sales dropped by 81.8pc to 19,600t.
Issue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016
Only phosphate-based fertilizer showed growth — DAP/MAP and NPK sales rose by 11.6pc and 11.8pc to 2.6mn t and 1.9mn t, respectively, during the period. Overall fertilizer sales for the year rose by 9pc to 6.6mn t.
"2015 was another challenging year in terms of the macro- economic environment. With prices for all commodities de- clining, it comes as no surprise that fertilizer prices followed the same trend," PhosAgro chief executive Andrey Guryev said.
PhosAgro's annual sales to Europe grew by 30pc to 1.25mn t, while sales to India rose to 700,000t. Latin American market performance was weaker as a result of low soybean prices and economic challenges in the region, the company said.
On the production side, PhosAgro produced 11.7pc more DAP/MAP at 2.6mn t. NPKs production in 2015 rose by 11.4pc to 1.9mn t. Urea production was up by 1.3pc to 978,100t; and SOP and sulphuric acid production gained 23.6pc and 5.6pc

to 36,700t and 4.7mn t, respectively.
"Throughout 2015, PhosAgro continued to invest in the mod- ernisation of its production facilities and to implement other cost-cutting initiatives… we managed to increase our produc- tion of fertilizers by 10pc year on year, and by the end of 2015 our annual fertilizer production capacity reached 7mn t," Guryev said.

exceeded 2.6mn t, a record output and an 8pc growth year on year over the 2.4mn t produced in 2014.
Al-Rowais added that the executive management was work- ing on cost reduction programs by increasing the productiv- ity and efficiency of its mines and processing facilities. The company is also moving towards consolidated services and empowering its IT to achieve cost-efficiency.
OCP’s Africa Fertilizer Complex inaugurated
Africa Fertilizer Complex, part of OCP's Jorf Lasfar phos- phate-production facility in Morocco was inaugurated on 1 February.
The plant will solely supply fertilizers to African markets. It has a nameplate capacity of 1.4mn t/yr of sulphuric acid, 450,000t of phosphoric acid and 1mn t of DAP/MAP/NPKs. The plant is currently running at full capacity a source at OCP said.
The fertilizer complex was built at a cost of 5.3bn dirham ($0.5bn).
Jorf Lasfar is planned as a phosphate production hub, part of OCP's expansion plan which is split in two phases. Construction of the first phase took from 2013 through to July 2015 and added a capacity of 4mn t/yr of DAP/MAP. The second phase of expansion will begin in 2020 with six proposed DAP/MAP units to be built, adding another 6mn t/ year capacity.
This will make OCP the largest single phosphates producer in the world.
Ma’aden’s profits drop 55pc in 2015
Saudi phosphate producer Ma’aden posted a net profit of Saudi riyal 605mn ($161mn) in 2015, a decrease of 55pc com- pared to the previous year.
Ma’aden CFO Khalid Al-Rowais said that the company has been impacted with the decline of commodity prices, spe- cifically in the aluminium business.
Annual 2015 phosphate sales amounted to 5.5bn riyals, a slight dip from 5.6bn riyals netted in 2014. DAP sales rose by around 11pc to 4.5bn riyals during the year. Full-year rev- enues across all products improved slightly by 2pc to 10.96bn riyals.

Americas Petrogas increases stake in Bayovar
Canadian independent Americas Petrogas has acquired an additional 30pc interest in the Peruvian phosphate explora- tion block Bayovar mineral concessions 5, 6, 7 and 8, from its partner, Peruvian Co-venturers.
The acquisition was wired through the mineral exploration company’s Peru-based subsidiary, bringing Americas Petro- gas’ net stake in Bayovar to 89pc. The other stakeholders are Indian Farmers Fertilizer Co-op and its affiliate, GrowMax Agri Corp.
Americas Petrogas will pay $8mn towards the deal, over a period of three years.
“We are pleased to have acquired this additional 30pc inter- est in the Bayovar Concessions which show the potential to be a world scale beneficiated phosphate rock export proj- ect,” said Abby Badwi, the executive chairman of Americas Petrogas.
“This acquisition results in the company holding close to a 90pc interest in Bayovar which we believe will facilitate the timely and efficient development of the project.”
