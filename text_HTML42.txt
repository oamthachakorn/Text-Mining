Exchange Rate: USD 1 = RMB 6.4
Urea
Production
China’s prill urea output was 804.3kt during the first week of September, down by 0.38% from the week before. Granular output was down significantly by 15.86%, reaching 151.5kt. According to statistics of 9 September, daily urea output was 193.6kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 71.83%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 75.33%, while gas-based producers’ average is 63.29%.
Domestic market
Domestic urea market prices dropped a bit because of weak demand. More than a week had past since the Beijing military parade; urea makers had resumed production. However, seeing that current market trends are unclear, distributors were cautious in purchasing, and unwilling to keep much inventory on hand.
In North China, Hebei Province urea markets remained sluggish; prices went down $3-5/t. Market demand was weak, and prices dropped almost to the bottom. Presently, mainstream ex-factory prices are $236-239/t. Also, East China urea markets were not strong in Shandong Province; the main urea makers there reduced prices further. Due to the off season, agricultural demand had stopped, while industrial buyers purchased only as needed. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $231-241/t.
In Central China, Henan Province markets did not improve; prices stayed low. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $238-244/t. In Southwest China’s Sichuan Province, urea markets remained stable; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $258-266/t.
Urea inventories in the main seaports amount to 607,000 tons, down 102,000 tons from last week; of that, 200,000 tons is in Yantai Port, 50,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 80,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port, 40,000 tons in Rizhao Port,
Page 3
20,000 tons in Yingkou Port, 180,000 tons in Jinzhou Port, 8,000 tons in Laizhou Port and 19,000 tons in Lianyungang Port.
Raw materials
Domestic anthracite markets as a whole remained stable; most big coal companies’ sales remained depressed. Markets were off season. The oversupply of coal kept increasing and prices kept declining.
North China anthracite market prices fluctuated little overall. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $111-113/t at Yangquan and Jincheng, almost unchanged from last week. In Central China’s Henan Province, anthracite prices stayed stable as usual. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices were $138/t in Henan Jiaozuo
and $142/t in Yongcheng, the same as last week. Southwest China’s anthracite markets remained unchanged; middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $109/t.
Ammonium Sulfate
Domestic ammonium sulfate markets were still on the upswing. Market demand is healthy; producers are confident in the market. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 64.8% average operating rate, almost up 2% from last week; meanwhile, caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers operated at about 80% on average, the same as last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $78-86/t in Shanxi Province, $91-97/t in Hebei Province, $94-109/t in East China, $88-100/t in Northeast China, and $94-100/t in Southwest China.
On 31 August, Hebei Huafeng held an ammonium sulfate tender; the final transaction price was $95/t, up $8/t from the last tender. On 1 September, Guangdong Shaogang auctioned 3,000 tons of ammonium sulfate; the closing price was $114/t.
The main seaports’ combined ammonium sulfate inventory is 150,000 tons, up 23,000 tons from last week, with 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 35,000 tons in Beihai Port, 5,000 tons in Yingkou Port and 60,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port.
Phosphate & NPK
Production
Typical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 80% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm still did not raise operating rates. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and maintained an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.
Domestic phosphate
DAP – Domestic DAP markets kept running steadily overall. Most DAP makers tended to existing orders; they made few new sales. Sales for the autumn fertilizer application period started gradually, the downstream markets in North China and East China had plenty of DAP products. Mainstream prices remained stable.
Central China DAP markets were almost unchanged. The main DAP makers maintained high operating rates; some output went to domestic markets, and the rest was sent for export. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content stayed at 422/t in Hubei Province, and the same product delivered to North China destinations is $445/t; delivered to Xinjiang AR destinations is $469/t.
Southwest China’s DAP producers mainly sent their products to seaports, and only some companies had
domestic market orders. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content are $406/t – $460-465/t FOB – and the same product delivered to North China destinations is $441-453/t.
DAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 453,000 tons (down by 6,000 tons from last week); of that, 120,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 100,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 80,000 tons in Beihai Port, 40,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 70,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 13,000 tons in Nantong Port.
MAP – Domestic MAP markets remained flat on the whole; after raising the prices last week, most MAP makers had no actual transaction on the new prices. The downstream NPK
Page 4
purchasers were unwilling to buy, they purchased only as needed.
Central China MAP markets kept steady; Hubei and Henan provinces’ MAP makers maintained stable operating rates, with most of them focused on orders already in hand. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $336-344/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $375-383/t for powder MAP with 60% content, the same as last week.
Southwest China MAP producers lowered their operating rates ; some even chose to stop production and overhauled. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan province are $320-331/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $336-344/t for powder MAP with 58% content in Yunnan Province, also like last week.
The main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 92,000 tons, down 53,000 tons from last week, including 30,000 tons in Yingkou Port, 27,000 tons in Fangcheng Port and 35,000 tons in Nanjing Port.
SSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets showed good momentum; most makers maintained high operating rates, some even running at full load. Mainstream ex-factory prices stayed at $56-66/t for SSP (12%) and $75-86/t for SSP (16%) in Yunnan Province.
Domestic TSP markets kept running normally, mainly fulfilling export markets. Mainstream FOB prices stayed at $305-330/t. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 95,000 tons, down 15,000 from last week – 40,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 25,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.
Domestic FMP markets were still quiet on the whole. Demand in the main markets was too low to sustain the market for long. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Yunnan and Hubei Provinces are $69-75/t for FMP (12%) and $84-91/t for FMP (15%).
International phosphates
The global phosphates market trade remains slow and giving the indication of down trend in Asia markets, but stable in West. For Brazil MAP 63 units, the market is having a stabilised price situation in the range $465-470/t cfr. This is for the spot offers coming from Russia in September. Russia and East Europe domestic market continues for Russian producers for the MAP and the NPKs. For the Morocco MAP to Brazil, the last reference is said at the $480/t cfr level. In NOLA market, the domestic DAP is giving the level in mid $430s/short ton fob. The main activity in Asia markets is from Pakistan, as the India demand starts to slow down to contact business only at the level in low $460s/t cfr India. The new business to Pakistan is understood in low/mid $460s/t cfr on two cargoes from China. The new tender for over 300,000t NPs to Ethiopia is coming this week. As in the last year, Morocco and Russia are main supply options.
Raw materials
Sulfur: Domestic sulfur markets did not improve, and prices
continued to fall. Sales were weak; most refineries continued to sell down their sulfur inventories. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $156-183/t in Northeast China, $183-191/t in North China, $175-203/t in East China, $167-188/t in South China and $177-183/t in Southwest China.
Imported sulfur markets were still weak on the whole; seaport sulfur inventories picked up slightly. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 1,050,000 tons of sulfur on hand, 72,000 tons more than last week, with 362,000 tons in Nantong Port, 50,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 350,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 80,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 35,000 tons in Beihai Port, 12,000 tons in Longkou Port and 160,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.
Sulfur Price and Inventory
Note: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.
Phosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets remained steady; rock prices saw no change. Some rock producers wanted to raise prices, but considering the current market, that would be hard to do.
Guizhou Province rock market prices were stable. FOT prices for 30% content stayed at $52/t from Wengan and $63/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock producers maintained their rock prices constant, mainstream prices stayed at $41-44/t for 28% content at Mabian, $34/t for 28% content at Leibo.
Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock makers’ mining rates were low. Their rock prices kept unchanged: $58/t for 28% content, $66/t for 30% content. In Central China, Hubei

International potash
There is still weak tendency in the world potash markets. For the latest business, the reports are of the decline in price of granular MOP for Europe, USA and South America. For such markets the import pricing is reported to be €290s/t cfr West Europe, the $290s/short ton for New
Orleans and the range of $305-310/t cfr Brazil. The other South America markets are more less stable at the level $330/t cfr for granular MOP in the small volumes. In the Asia markets, the challenge of strong USD$ against the forex of all markets is still great. In Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam the forex weakness is delaying the new business, and preventing new tender activity.

New Fertilizer Project in China
1) Urea Project (1000tpy, Product)
Note: some new projects have been completed in 2011, and were delayed to put into production to 2012, such as Guodian Chifeng, Guizhou Jinchi, Jinxin Chemical, Kuitun Jinjiang Chemical and Yangmei Heshun.
We revised the 2011’s table and put these projects into 2012’s table. In addition, 520k tons of urea capacity of Inner Mongolia Tianrun has been delayed to 2013 due to uncertain factors. So the actual new capacity of urea in 2011 putting into production was 3.14m tons.

   |     |     |  Province’s NPK markets showed good momentum; prices  |     |  
   |     |     |  rose  |  a  |  bit. Mainstream  |  ex-factory  |  prices  |  there are  |     |  
   |     |     |  $297-313/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $359-375/t for  |     |  
   |     |     |  SOP-NPK (15-15-15). The price of SOP-NPK was up 16%  |     |  
   |     |     |  from last week. In Central China, Henan Province’s NPK  |     |  
   |     |     |  markets saw no adjustments. Local demand was weak, but  |     |  
   |     |     |  main NPK makers sent output to surrounding markets – the  |     |  
   |     |     |  transportation situation was tight. At this stage, mainstream  |     |  
   |     |     |  ex-factory prices there are  |  $289-305/t for  |  MOP-NPK  |     |  
   |     |     |  (15-15-15), $344-359/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as  |     |  
   |     |     |  last week. In North China, Hebei Province NPK markets  |     |  
   |     |     |  remained flat overall. The average operating rates were still  |     |  
   |     |     |  low; mainstream ex-factory prices stayed at $297-320/t for  |     |  
   |     |     |  MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $344-359/t for SOP-NPK  |     |  
   |  Domestic NPK – Domestic NPK markets as a whole  |  (15-15-15).  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  
   |  remained stable; some NPK makers tried to raise prices, but  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
