Sulphur tracks firm phosphates trajectory
The sulphur market is stable-to-firm. Prices in China have risen marginally to around $160/t cfr for granular sulphur and most sources believe the low-$160s/t cfr is achievable. In China, demand is being driven by export commitments for DAP into India and a firm NPK market leading to healthy in- terest in MAP production. Sulphur stocks are low and traders and buyers are active.
India also continues to pick off tonnage, despite reports of high levels of domestic sulphur inventory. Latest deals reflect the mid-$160s/t cfr. A lot has been made of the mon- soon deficit predicted at 80-88pc of normal. But its impact on fertilizer demand is still highly debatable. Bottom line, India still needs to buy sulphur and DAP for the rabi season.
All of which makes Aramco's July lifting price at $144/t fob (reflecting close to $160/t cfr China) seem a slightly modest increase which has surprised some observers. The increase is $2/t over the June number.
Nevertheless, the outlook for the next 30-60 days remains for modest price gains on the back of a stable-to-firm phosphates market. DAP demand in the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, Bangladesh and India) is estimated at 4mn t im- ports for 2H 2015. Factor in the emergence of Latin Ameri-

Asia
China
Demand is firming in China on the back of firm DAP orders for India and a relatively healthy MAP market for domestic NPK production. Sulphur prices have moved up as a result with numerous sources reporting that $160/t cfr has already been achieved for granular sulphur and that fresh business will probably take place in the low-$160s/t cfr. In terms of actual business:
One trader is reported to have sold a cargo of granular
sulphur into the north of the country at $160/t cfr.
Another deal for the south was reported in the high- $150s/t cfr, thought to be of Indian origin.
Another trader confirms selling 50,000t at $159.80/t cfr.
There are unconfirmed reports of a small sale of sulphur at $165/t cfr.
Another driver is the relative lack of domestic supply. Reports indicate that Puguang will lower gas production in the second half of the year, though unconfirmed, possibly limiting sulphur supply to around 100,000t/month during this period.
All of which has combined to make traders more confident about taking positions, with end-users also buying. With port inventories not that high and imports limited traders are hoping to achieve higher prices.
Molten sulphur prices are also reportedly firming on the back of higher granular levels. Prices are now talked in a low- $140s/mid-$150s/t cfr range.
However crushed lump pricing is more opaque. Domestic prices are reported to be firming but there is an isolated report of a Chinese trader purchasing Russian product at $130-132/t cfr.
Sinopec in China has raised its sulphur offer prices again. On 9 June, the price out of Wanzhou was raised by RMB10/t to RMB 1,200/t. The price out of Dazhou is RMB 1,190-1,200/t, an increase of RMB20-30/t.

Phosphate market summary
The global phosphates market is relatively balanced. Suppliers are comfortable and those with unsold tonnes, particularly for Latin America, are not under pressure in anticipation of further seasonal demand emerging. On the demand side, India and Latin America remain the focus although trade activity in India has slowed slightly on adequate supply for the kharif season.
Bangladesh’s DAP/TSP tender continues to hold the mar- ket’s attention this week. The awards are expected to be confirmed in the next couple of weeks before shipping commences late June/early July. As it stands, if all those invited open l/cs, then it seems that China will mop up almost all the 400,000t DAP that Bangladesh has tendered for while some have indicated that Australian DAP could also be in the supply mix.
Based on this likely outcome, Chinese producers are set for a fairly comfortable Q3 against continued demand from India, Pakistan and Southeast Asia. Moreover, Latin American MAP demand will also provide some Chinese producers with an additional outlet although this shipping window will likely close before the end of July for the product to arrive in time.
So it is no surprise to see a slight firming in Chinese DAP prices to the mid-$460s/t fob minimum. This is in con- trast to reports in India of buyers countering offers with lower numbers below the mid-$470s/t cfr on account of adequate supplies for June/July. It is estimated that India has booked close to 3mn t during April-July. Moreover, concerns over the strength of the monsoon and a weak rupee are also playing a role in this downward price pres- sure being placed by the buyers. But in reality, barring a disastrous monsoon, suppliers know that India needs to buy another 2.5mn t this year. Factor in the additional demand from Saudi Arabia and China’s traditional demand markets during these next few months and an uptick in price seems more likely, albeit this will be limited and India pricing will depend on several key factors including the maximum retail price (MRP), the value of the Indian rupee and the strength of the monsoon.
Main Chinese Port Inventories (’000 t)
RMB 1,260/t, up noticeably on deals done in the RMB 1,190- 1,200/t ex-works last week. Crushed lumps are set RMB 40-70/t below this depending on type.
It is estimated that the domestic price might move up soon because Aramco just announced $2/t increase for July ship- ments.
Port stocks have risen marginally this week by around 8,000t to 972,000t. Of the total, 340,000t are at Nantong, 80,000t at Qingdao, 157,000t at Fangcheng, 120,000t at Zhangjiang, 4,000t at Behai and 210,000t at Xhenjiang.
India
There is plenty of talk regarding a prospective poor monsoon (latest estimates suggest a rainfall at 80-88pc of normal) but the impact of this on DAP consumption is still highly debatable. Bottom line the phosphates market has slowed because of high levels of buying in 1Q and early 2Q and the DAP import line up for India in June is healthy at 850,000t. Kharif is covered and thoughts are now turning to potential rabi demand. Some sources believe the sulphur market will be relatively quiet for June until phosphates demand picks up in July and August.
Nevertheless, sulphur trade activity continues apace, with the following developments seen this week:
FACT closed a tender on 10 June for 25,000t for 6-10 July arrival. It is understood that it received one offer from Swiss Singapore in the mid-$160s/t cfr. An award had not been reported at press time.
A trader is reported to have sold a 10-12,000t cargo of sulphur to Coromandel in the low/mid-$160s/t cfr.
SPIC is reported to have taken a 20,000t cargo of Kuwaiti sulphur in the mid-$160s/t cfr for June.

The Swiss Singapore vessel MV Fratzis Star reached Vizag to discharge 8,800t for KPR and others and will then proceed to Cochin to discharge the balance of 26,200t for FACT.
Meanwhile the MV Nikator arrived at Paradeep on 10 June with 27,148t sulphur for PPL.
Australia
Australian sulphur imports jumped significantly in April to reach 147,542t according to GTIS, almost all of it sourced from Canada. This brings January-April year-to-date imports to 272,168t, virtually unchanged from the same period a year earlier. Canada accounts for virtually all the tonnage, representing an increase in shipments from this source of nearly 15pc, mainly at the expense of Qatari sulphur which shipped virtually nothing in 2015 versus nearly 32,000t in the first four months of 2014.

greece
The MV Ekmen is under loading at present in Greece for shipment of under 10,000t of granular sulphur to Brazil. The relatively uncommon route is a result of lower asking prices by Mediterranean buyers.
Morever, in Brazil buyers of small parcels are heard to be paying above $170/t cfr for prompt tonnes, offering better netbacks to some Mediterranean sulphur suppliers. Lower freight rates, as a result of lower oil prices, also attributed to better netbacks.
Suppliers of Med sulphur are heard to be in negotiation with buyers outside of the Med, including Argentina.

US
Syncrude has stopped shipments again because of H2S is- sues; it has halted shipments three times since mid-April. Refinery utilization in the US Gulf coast reached 98.4pc the week ended 5 June, the highest figure since the EIA started tracking that data in June 2010. Overall US refinery produc- tion was 94.6pc the week ended 5 June, the highest level since December 2014.
East Europe
Russia
GazpromExport has cancelled its tender for 36,000t of crushed lump sulphur, citing improved netbacks from con- tract selling with Austrofin. The tender was for June ship- ment out of the Black Sea.
Latin America
Brazil
Anglo American has yet to issue a tender for the import of around 37,000t of sulphur for July shipment. Trading sources say it will hold the import inquiry around mid-June.
The MV Ekmen is reported to be under loading in Greece with around 10,000t of granular sulphur. The market is reported to be paying above $170/t cfr for prompt tonnage. This offers better netbacks relative to Med markets.
2015 year-to-date Brazilian sulphur imports are running more or less at parity with 2014 levels according to latest data released by GTIS.
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
Year-to-date imports for January-May now stand at 798,513t, down 0.4pc compared to the same periof of 2014, according to the data.
Of this total, the US constituted the single largest source with 266,613t, although this number was down 35.4pc year on year.
Kazakhstan was very close behind with 262,095t, a drop of only 3.4pc year on year.
The major gains were made in Russia, which saw shipments to Brazil rise significantly to 206,888t, a rise of 426.2pc on the 39,314t shipped in the same five months of 2014.
