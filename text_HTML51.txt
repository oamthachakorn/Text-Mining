ANALYSIS
Undertone firmer on prospects of pent-up demand
A firmer undertone was evident in global urea markets as the first week of February progressed, albeit after some downward adjustments from select sources. The January slide in prices from all origins has halted, and some improvements were registered in delivered values, which in turn prompted more buyers to reappear for coverage.
Priced substantially above other sources, Egyptian producers did concede a discount of around
$9/mt on deals concluded at $224/mt FOB last week, but producers are since claiming to have recaptured the lost ground. Outages in Egypt on a ruptured pipeline were initially expected to fuel substantial price- increases, but a rapid return to normality will likely limit prospects for significant improvement in the short term.
European values also lost some ground based on sales concluded last week from the Middle East and poorer returns on US sales to regional producers at that time, but the reversal in the US pricing has since provided better netbacks and boosted expectations for further gains.
The US has been and remains the key market in supporting a change in direction so far. Prompt granular urea barge values at New Orleans gained $17/st from the start of the week to the end, although the average week over week rose only $1/st. However, forward physical sales for late February and March reached
$208/st FOB. Overall US traders were marginally bullish on granular urea heading into next week's annual TFI Business Meeting in Orlando, Florida.
More optimism has also spilled over to FSU supply of granular urea. After failing to achive interest much above $190/mt FOB in prior sessions, GrodnoAzot opted to reject bids more than $10/mt higher in its February 1 tender, and is aiming for more when retendering February 5 for the sale of 20,000 mt.
Brazilian prices for granular urea have improved on the back of firmer US sentiment, and suppliers are optimimistic that relatively inexpensive credit available to small and mid-sized farms will combine with significantly higher corn prices in the domestic market to stimulate forward offtake and imports of urea.
Other importers in the Americas also appear to have sensed that urea values may be closer to a floor, and have emerged with requirements for prompt and forward positions of prilled and granular urea. Prices are being tested this week for both grades in Mexico, while buying interest also reappeared for granular imports from Canada.
Markets and supply-sources in Asia have been relatively quiet leading up to celebrations and holidays for lunar New Year, but buyers needing to cover short positions for prompt loading did have to concede higher costs to secure cover.
While too early to predict a major surge in prices, traders that shorted prills and granular urea at netbacks some $20/mt below current values appear unlikely to secure cover at a margin on positions that need to load by March, and some positions could well result in substantial losses.
Highlights of the week
∙US NOLA prompt and forward prices gained all week, and
∙Inland distributors can support $5-10/st higher barge costs even without raising inland prices
∙Brazilian buyers face higher offers, accordingly, and are left with few options but to accept
∙Middle East netbacks up on US and Brazilian improvements and spot sales
∙Egyptian prices adjust lower via sale of 20,000 mt for prompt loading
∙Baltic prices surge as traders cover in, and prior short sales look scary
∙Black Sea values stable to firm and traders unwilling to add aggressive shorts
∙Chinese domestic market quiet ahead of lunar New Year, but demand is up
∙Chinese sellers reject bid to cover prior low-priced trader shorts
∙Turkish prices set to move up as traders are unwilling to provide additional aggressive quotes
Short term outlook
Improving. Oversupply remains, but the return of buyers needing to cover pent-up demand is set to influnce prices positively in the short term. A price-rally is not in the cards yet, but cannot be excluded if demand from the US remains strong and Brazilan developments trigger added purchasing in the region.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Prices hold for remaining urea
Granular urea bins at the distributor and retail level across the Midwest are exhausted in many
cases. Increasingly quotes to retailers are not based on prompt pick up, but on when warehouses can be restocked by barge when the upper Mississippi River system reopens for the spring.
This situation is why prompt offers for the remaining granular urea as far north as the Twin Cities in Minnesota are holding at $260/st FOB, while river-open prices for the same point are closer to $250/st FOB. The lowest prompt price tag in the Midwest region remains $235/st FOB around St. Louis, Missouri, which still is accessible by barge.
Canada: Coop Federee purchase suggested
Canadian importer Coop Federee is reported to have booked a cargo of 20-25,000 mt granular urea with a trader supplying from the Baltic in February or early March at $212/mt CFR basis one-port discharge.
Evidently convinced that the market for granular urea may have reached a floor, the importer is suggested to be seeking an additional cargo for March loading.
US NOLA: Thin trading, wide price spread
By the end of the week's trading, prompt granular urea barges had changed hands at $187-204/st FOB New Orleans, but with the market trending higher on amost each transaction.
New Orleans values jumped starting February 2 after CF went shopping for prompt barges. The producer paid $198/st FOB New Orleans or more for two-four barges, but stepped away from the market when offers rose to $200/st FOB.
Multiple sales were confirmed as low as $187/st FOB February 1, but most prompt business appears to have occurred around $195-200/st FOB.
Bids for 2H February started the week at $194/st FOB, but forward business has been booked up to $208/st FOB.
Import lineup
Meanwhile, a 40-45,000 mt cargo of granular urea and a 30-35,000 mt cargo of granular urea have been booked for March arrival in the US. The urea was bought at $195-200/mt FOB Middle East. The smaller of the two cargos is believed to belong to Keytrade, and will arrive in early March, thanks to taking the short route through the Suez canal. The larger cargo has been linked to just about every importer to the US market, but confirmation of ownership could not be secured at press time.
Previously Koch was confirmed as owning a spot Chinese panamax due into New Orleans at the end of March, while Dreymoor will bring a PIC 40,000 mt contract cargo to the US Gulf next month.
Mexico: Group testing prices February 4
The Mexican Group of Importers is evaluating offers for 25,000 mt prilled or granular urea February 4. The enquiry called for offers to be submitted for the quantity to load in February/early March for discharge at three East Coast Mexico ports.
Other importers are also contemplating purchases, and will be following the Group tender closely for price guidance.
Mexican imports of urea from January through
November were meanwhile assessed by customs at
1.43million mt, down by 0.5% on the same period in 2014.
Imports from China were down by 5.9% to 756,000 mt and Russia was off by 1.2% to 484,000 mt. Arrivals from the UAE were up from zero to 52,000 mt while Ukraine was down by 52% to 43,400 mt.
November imports were off sharply from 149,000 in 2014 to 19,000 mt in 2015. Russia accounted for 18,200 mt of the November 2015 volume while arrivals from China were down from 127,000 mt in 2014 to 140 mt in 2015.
US S. Plains: Sales may support higher prices
Some distributors along the Arkansas River who have sold most of their granular urea at $240/st FOB in recent days, believe demand is sufficient to move back up to $245/st FOB.
Many sellers in the region report a steady stream of retail demand, almost all of which appears to have been sold to meet prior sales to farmers. This means a great deal of retailer space remains to be filled before the top-dress run on winter wheat gets underway in force.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Credit and domestic corn values to aid imports
As was highlighted in the February 2 Short Term Urea Forecast, optimism for additional demand for fertilizers in Brazil, particularly of urea, is fuelled following an announcement made by the Brazilian government in conjunction with Banco do Brasil (Bank of Brazil) regarding available credit.
Up to Brazilian Real (BRL)10 billion ($2.51 billion) in credit were to be made available to farmers from February 1, according to Brazilian media channel Canal Rural.
Small to medium sized farmers can receive loans for input purchasing through the National Program to Help Medium Sized Rural Producers (PRONAMP). With credit issues now resolved at rates of 7.75% p.a. for loans up to BRL 710,000 ($178,000) and at 8.75% for loans up to BRL 1.2 million ($300,000), farmers will have a highly significant advantage compared to rates charged by commercial banks in excess of 20% p.a.
The early credit announcement follows complaints in 2015 that credit was not available until May/June, significantly cutting farm budgets and fertilizer demand. Brazilian calendar 2015 urea imports of 2.85 million mt were down by about 32.5% on 2014, according to GTIS customs data. The decline was mainly attributed to these credit issues and the sinking value of the real against the US dollar.
On a further positive note for Brazilian farmers, domestic corn prices have surged substantially despite the sideways move in international corn values. Corn prices for domestic buyers in Rio Grande do Sul where farmers have harvested about 20% of the full-season crop are up by 45%. This is primarily due to a surge in corn exports, triggered via the significant depreciation of the Brazilian currency. Domestic livestock producers have faced shortages of corn due to the increase in exports, forcing values higher.
Favourable prices are expected to increase forward corn-planting. Farmers in southern Brazil have been reducing full-season corn acreage over the past decade in favour of more first-crop
soybeans. Consequently, more than 65% of Brazil’s corn crop is now produced as a second crop planted after soybeans.
Brazil: Prompt values move higher
Delivered values for granular urea to arrive in February/early March are up this week following confirmed purchases ranging from a repeat of last week's $195/mt CFR up to $205/mt CFR.
The earlier Fertipar deal for 40,000 mt at numbers suggested in the upper $180s/mt CFR is based on open origin and furthermore with an option to load as late as May/June. Trammo is still suggested as the supplier.
Offers for additional cargoes for forward delivery are pegged no lower than $210/mt CFR, but these are yet to elicit firm buying interest.
Colombia: Imports through November off slightly
January-November imports of urea into Colombia of 489,000 mt were down by about 1.4% on the same period in 2014.
Arrivals from China in 2015 were down by 8% and Venezuela was off by 14% to 169,000 mt and 142,000 mt, respectively. Russia was up 22% to 93,000 mt, UAE was up from zero to 45,000 mt while Venezuela suffered 56% setback to 18,600 mt.
November imports were down by 54% on the prior year, to reach 46,300 mt in 2015. China accounted for 27,000 mt (down 48%) and Venezuela was at 18,600 mt (down 56%).
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic Sea: Grodno to retender as prices move up
GrodnoAzot opted not to accept bids at a $200-202/mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent in its February 1 tender to sell 15,000 mt granular urea for prompt loading from the plant, and has issued a revised tender to close February 5 for 20,000 mt.
The producer is seeking netbacks above $210/mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent, which contrasts netbacks available from recent business in Canada, reported at $212/mt CFR to Coop Federee for a $190/mt FOB return to the seller, at best.
Grodno has meanwhile withdrawn from the export market for prills, preferring to concentrate on sales to the domestic market at returns well in excess of a $200/mt FOB equivalent, according to the producer.
Prilled values are also up via sales to traders short on prior sales. Producers claim netbacks ranging from $188/mt FOB to $193/mt FOB. The high end reflects deals done for prills to load in combination with other products such as DAP and NPKs.
The low end of the range is up sharply on returns in recent sales to Turkey, reported in prior Fertilizer Week issues, that would generate netbacks in the low $160s/mt FOB.
Russia: November exports up, but Jan-Nov declines
Russian producers exported 513,000 mt urea in November 2015, up 20.2% on November 2014. Shipments to Brazil of 121,000 mt were nevertheless down by 45%, but Turkey was up from 3,300 mt to 67,000 mt. Peru and Guatemala accounted for about 40,000 mt each, up from zero in November 2014.
January-November exports of 4.3 million mt were however off by 8.9% on the same months in 2014. Brazil retained the lead with 1 million mt, but this was down by 12.7% on the prior year. Shipments to the US were up 28% to 591,000 mt while Turkey did not yet fully recover with 272,000 mt, a 3.1% decline.
Peru accounted for 206,000 mt, a 21% decline, and Germany was off by 21.4% to 198,000 mt. Ukraine was ahead 24.3% to 190,000 mt while shipments to Mexico declined 58% to 160,000 mt.
Black Sea: Trade still lacks substantial drive
Trade in prilled urea from Yuzhnyy/TIS remains slow following sales as reported last week. Neither sellers nor buyers are prepared to make the necessary adjustments in price ideas needed to trigger additional deals in the short term, but sellers have the definite upper hand as requests for cover from traders increase.
Offers for February from producers and marketers were firmly above $195/mt FOB at the beginning of the week, with trades confirmed at $200/mt FOB. March is quoted no lower than $205/mt FOB, and firm bids bids are suggested at that number. The weekly range has been set accordingly.
Various estimates circulate on the pricing in the deal between Salavat and EuroChem pursuant to the Salavat tender last week. While unconfirmed, consensus is building for a number around an even $180/mt FOB Tuapse or possibly marginally higher.
Salavat prills regularly sell at a significant discount to regular Black Sea prills due to quality issues, and the sales-price is therefore not included in the week's Black Sea assessment. The level accepted by the producer is nevertheless widely used in negotiations for regular quality material, but efforts to that effect are being rejected by sellers.
January shipments from Yuzhnyy/TIS did meanwhile marginally exceed 100,000 mt, and shipments plus fully firm nominations for February are close to 23,500 mt:
EUROPE
Turkey: Buyers largely retreat after recent purchases
Seemingly covered via purchases of more than 230,000 mt as highlighted in prior issues, Turkish buyers are not out in force again this week.
Gubretas is evaluating offers received in its February 4 tender for 10,000 mt for prompt loading for Yarimca, but a decision is not expected to emerge before February 5. Details on offers submitted were not released, but repeat deals below $200/mt CFR with credit are highly unlikely given current quotes from the Black Sea around that number on FOB basis with payment at sight.
France: French Bay values down by about €5/mt
Trades in granular urea in the French Bay this week were concluded in a relatively wide spread at €217- 225/mt FCA, with the most recent deals done at the low end of the range.
The low end reflects about $230/mt CIF, duty paid, which in turn suggests values from Egypt some $10/mt below the most recent sale at $215/mt FOB.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: Outlook improving via sales formula deals
Middle East producers are enjoying improvements in returns on spot sales and on quantities priced via formulae, with the netbacks from markets assessed at $195-204/mt FOB.
Contract cargoes destined for Thailand are about $10/mt lower based on spot sales into that market below $200/mt CFR, but that number appears very unlikely to be repeated in the short term.
Two traders are reported to have booked cargoes from Oman for February/early March loading at $195/mt FOB and $200/mt FOB, respectively, and SIUCI has adjusted offers for additional March availability to $205/mt, according to traders in discussions with the producer.
US prices that surged to a peak of $204/st FOB barge at New Orleans over the week would provide sellers with returns around $218/mt CIF Mississippi River. Forward deals were also concluded some $5-7/mt lower, for netbacks at $197-204/mt FOB Middle East after deduction of freight, charges and a small margin to intermediaries on cargoes with freight fixed in the spot market.
South Africa: December imports up, calendar year lower
South African urea importers took delivery of 63,900 mt in December 2015, an increase of 28.5% on December 2014. UAE arrivals of 27,000 mt were up by 47% while China and Saudi Arabia were up from zero to 24,500 mt and 12,500 mt, respectively. Qatar was down from 26,000 mt in November 2014 to zero in 2015.
Calendar 2015 imports were nevertheless down by almost 27% on 2014, to 663,000 mt. Qatar retained the lead with 231,000 mt, a 1.6% decline, while arrivals from Saudi Arabia were down 11% to 184,000 mt. The UAE accounted for 141,000 mt, up from 45,000 mt in the prior year.
Russian arrivals were down 15% to 28,000 mt while China nosedived from 236,000 mt in 2014 to 25,000 mt in 2015, and Oman was off by 73% to 22,000 mt.
Egypt: New sale at lower number
Mainstream bids for granular urea from traders are in the low $210s/mt FOB, but these are rejected by producers. Suppliers are stating firm intent not to concede numbers below the $215/mt FOB low concluded for a spot prompt 20,000 mt this week, and also cite significant demand at substantially higher returns in the domestic free-trade market.
A subsequent sale at $220/mt FOB has been reported, but this could not be verified and has not been included in the week's assessment.
HFC is planning to tender next week for the sale of as much as 30,000 mt granular urea to load by the end of February, and other producers are likely to follow with tenders.
MOPCO reported this week that the rupture/explosion that occurred January 25 on the PetroGas pipeline between Port Said and Damietta feeding the MOPCO I, II and III ammonia and urea units interrupted all output of urea. The producer expects pipeline repairs to be completed within about 10 days, and regular flow of urea to recommence around February 15.
MOPCO is confident that gas supply to its plants at Damietta will be not interrupted this summer in favour of power generation.
New LNG import facilities and the need for Egypt to draw in foreign currency from export sales will keep summer operating rates around 70-75%, the company said in Cairo.
The government plans as many as three new LNG regasification terminals over the next two years, taking the total to five. The three new terminals are all planned for the Red Sea coast.
The Damietta pipeline incident had limited impact on other producers. Egyfert (EFC) is reporting output at about 80% of rated capacity and Alexfert (AFC) is at 85%. Helwan (HFC) reported February 3 that output was restored after a 72 hour outage, and the plant is now running at 90% of rated capacity.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: November imports down, but Jan-Nov up
Imports of urea by India ascertained by customs in November 2015 were 620,000 mt, a 51% drop on November 2014, but Iranian arrivals were up from 33,000 mt to 311,000 mt.
Chinese arrivals were down from 1.16 million mt in
November 2014 to 169,000 mt in 2015 while
Oman was up 71% to 134,000 mt.
The January-November volume was nevertheless up by 59% to 8.66 million mt with China in the lead at 4.6 million mt, an increase of 27%. Omani arrivals were up by 58% to 2.07 million mt and Iran was up from 407,000 mt to 1.62 million mt.
Imports from Ukraine were 118,000 mt and Qatar accounted for 71,000 mt.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Indonesia: Kaltim formula tender yet to be floated
The expected Pupuk Kaltim tender for the sale of up to 500,000 mt granular urea to load via formula contracts through June is yet to be floated by the new management of the producer.
Local reports suggest that Kaltim low regional prices in recent weeeks may result in a switch from urea exports to ammonia exports, but this is yet to be confirmed.
With regional urea values improving slightly while prices for ammonia continue to decline, urea may again become the favoured product. That will however be contingent on further increases to match Kaltim's costs assessed above $230/mt FOB which form part of the formula agreements with urea offtakers.
China: Market defies short traders
Activity in China is at low ebb due to the regional lunar New Year festivities, but prices for prilled and granular urea have been moving up in recent days, triggered not only by domestic demand for blending and
direct application, but also by traders short on prior sales seeking cover for relatively prompt shipment for export.
Sales of prills are reported back up to $195/mt FOB, and standard quality granular has traded a fraction below $200/mt FOB. Offers for additional February tonnage are suggested closer to $205/mt FOB for both grades from main ports.
Smaller lots from river ports can still be secured in the low $190s/mt FOB, according to regional traders, but bids from buyers attempting to cover prior shorts requiring values into the $170s/mt to become profitable are being ignored/rejected.
Thailand: Liven books granular
Liven booked a cargo of about 20,000 mt Middle East granular urea with a Thai importer for February loading. The trader did not disclose the price agreed, but local reports suggests a delivered value in the mid to upper $190s/mt CFR.
This implies a producer-return in the low $180s/mt FOB from the Middle East for Liven to generate a margin.
Offers are since up significantly for Middle East material, reflecting recent sales to other markets in the $190s/mt FOB and forward quotes above $200/mt FOB.
Malaysia: NAFAS books prills from China
Malaysian importer/farmers' union NAFAS secured cover for 6,000 mt prilled urea for February loading for western Malaysia discharge around an even $200/mt CFR, according to regional traders. Netbacks to Chinese suppliers from river-ports are assessed below $185/mt FOB.
South Korea: Sales of Chinese granular at low prices
Pricing slightly south of $200/mt CFR is reported in the two tenders for granular urea in South Korea in the end-January tenders by Pungnong (6,000 mt) and KG Chemical (3,000 mt). Shipment was requested by 20- 29 February in the sessions.
Freight and transaction charges are assessed marginally above $15/mt. This is indicative of netbacks to sellers loading from small Chinese river-ports in the low $180s/mt FOB, more than $12/mt below current mainstream quotes for large parcels to load from main ports.
Philippines: Imports through October decline
October imports of urea by Philippine buyers of 56,800 mt were down by 49.4% on the 112,000 mt imported in October 2014. Arrivals from Malaysia were nevertheless ahead by 33% to 30,800 mt while China was off 63% to 22,700 mt.
The October arrivals lifted the January-October volume close to 590,000 mt, down by 3.8% on the prior year. China was ahead 2% to 275,000 mt, and arrivals from Qatar were up by 247% to 93,500 mt. Shipments originating in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia were down by 63% and 87% to 25,300 mt and 6,000 mt, respectively.
New Zealand: Calendar 2015 imports up close to 10%
Calendar 2015 imports of urea into New Zealand of 598,000 mt were up by about 9.7% on calendar 2014, with Saudi Arabia in the lead with 346,000 mt, an increase of 3.1%.
This was followed by China with 115,000 mt, up by 1.5%. Arrivals from Malaysia were 61% ahead at 71,000 mt, and Indonesia was up 26% to 58,000 mt.
Imports in December 2015 of 75,800 mt were down 16.1% on December 2014, while arrivals from Saudi Arabia in December 2015 of 31,900 mt were off by 48%. China accounted for 28,800 mt, up from 204 mt in December 2014, but Malaysia was down by 48.4% to 14,200 mt.

ANALYSIS
UAN prices continue to slide as buyers wait for floor
UAN
UAN prices continued to fall with except in Germany where there were no trades reported. Abu Qir's tender next week will provide and indication on the extent of discounts required for buyers to re-enter with the intent of shipping to Europe.
Some producers are all still contemplating UAN production cuts to rather than selling at break-even at best, or at a loss.
Abu Qir is looking to improve on the $140/mt FOB price achieved in its January 26 tender, but this appears unlikely at present. Dependent on the outcome in its February 8 tender the producer will limit or altogether stop production of UAN.
Bunge bought 25,000 mt of UAN from Nitron for Argentina, likely to be loaded from CF production out of the US.
Achema's 1.36 million mt/year UAN plants are still at limited output due to a technical issue in one of its ammonia lines since January 2016. The units are expected to start production in February, with availablity ample in March.
GrodnoAzot remains quiet on UAN, and is reported to be continuing to place output in the domestic market, claiming returns well above those currently available in the export market.
US activity is seasonaly modest, but barge offers have not declined in the last couple of weeks, while inland resale values also are relatively steady. Next week's TFI annual business meeting and the March US planting forecast likely will provide key guidance for UAN prices going forward.
Terminals at Rouen and Germany are well covered with very little capacity to take on more UAN in the short term. Prices have declined to €150-155/mt FCA in France with Germany reporting no recent business.
China will be quiet during the lunar New Year holiday period, but producers are continuing to limit production on poor netbacks. Even so there will be some quantities available to load at the end of February. The Chinese price is assessed at $145-150/mt FOB.

Any hope for an big increase in demand for AS has now dissipated due to upcoming holidays in China and an end to buying for the Safrinha crop in Brazil.
Chinese producers are in little hurry to sell before Chinese New Year celebrations with caprolactam grade product now reported available at an even $100/mt FOB.
Offers for caprolactam grade AS from China into Brazil meanwhile are widely available at $130/mt CFR, although there is little business done as buying for the Safrinha crop continues to wind down.
Turkish buyers have shown some interest in securing product with KemerovoAzot linked to the sale of 6- 8,000 mt caprolactam grade AS into Turkey, possibly to Gemlik. Reports at press time suggest business was concluded at $130/mt FOB equivalent, although other market sources contend this level is too high.
Finland’s Norilsk Nickel is reportedly in the freight market for 6-8,000 mt steel grade AS to load for prompt shipment from Pori to Samsun for Toros.
Ammonium Nitrate/CAN
AN prices remain soft for yet another week, despite the increases in urea values registered in main markets such as Brazil and Turkey. The undertone in urea is also relatively firm for forward positions, but AN will remain overpriced in the short term as FSU producers try to maintain netbacks close to $190/mt FOB for AN while quoting urea a mere $10/mt higher.
Demand is subdued with the exception of some small quantities for North Africa. Turkish and Brazilian buyers appear content to stay sidelined until and unless prices match urea values more closely, with premiums for the nitrates within historical levels.
Buyers also point to the depressed market for UAN where sales from Egypt were made last week at $140/mt FOB. That number reflected urea values around $200/mt FOB on a pure nutrient basis, while Egyptian urea traded at the time at $224/mt FOB.
Prices for CAN in NW Europe remain under pressure on limited demand while supply is set to increase substantially in about two weeks when OCI is due to restart its Geleen plant.
MARKETS
UAN
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Modest shift in UAN quotes
US UAN indications arguably are up marginally this week. However, the difference from earlier reports is very modest and reflects higher costs from some inland terminals rather than improved enduser support. The current Midwest price spread is $6.94-7.00/unit FOB.
US NOLA: UAN quotes holding firm
More and more traders are confirming that despite lower bids and offers in the paper markets, prompt UAN- 32 barges are not available below $160/st FOB New Orleans.
Much of the more bearish talk in the marketplace has been fueled by the rumor that CF is supporting a cargo sale through a trader to Argentina that would net no better than $130-140/mt FOB US Gulf. However, domestic physical offers and barge offers from UAN importers have not reached near these levels.
US Atlantic Coast: Import competition drives UAN lower
UAN truck prices along the US East Coast have fallen as low as $5.31/unit FOB in the Chesapeake region. Prices are still posted up to $5.94/unit FOB from terminals further south.
The driver for the current decline appears to be the willingness of sellers of UAN from EuroChem, Acron and possibly other suppliers to compete hard for business in order to clear tank space for further imports. Postings along the Atlantic seaboard were over $6.72/unit FOB in prior weeks.
As a result of this competition, indications for spot UAN Cargos to the US East Coast have declined $5/mt from the prior week to $170-175/mt CFR. Some importers argue they can buy below this level but no completed business has been confimed in the $160s/mt CFR so far.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Argentina: Bunge will be supplied by Nitron
Reports from other participants in the session suggest that Nitron booked the recent Bunge requirement for 25,000 mt of UAN-32 for Argentina at $171/mt CFR.
The origin of the cargo was not revealed, but indications from the freight-market are that the parcel may load from the US.
Bunge's prior purchase for Argentina was booked October 22 with EuroChem around the $220/mt CFR marker.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: November exports continue to head for the US
Russia exported 103,216 mt UAN-32 in November 2015, up 12% on the same period last year, according to GTIS data.
Russian exports to the US in November fell 4% to 87,894 mt, but still comprise 85% of Russian exports to the US. Ukraine was the second largest receiver of UAN from Russia in November 2015 at 15,024 mt, up from zero the previous year.
Russia was the largest global exporter of UAN in the January-November 2015 period, followed by Lithuania. Total Russian exports for the first 11 months of this year were 1.56 million mt, a 6% decline year-on-year. Again most of its UAN volumes were directed to the US (88% market share).
EUROPE
Germany: No deals reported, pipeline and tanks are full
There has been no reported activity in the German UAN market in recent weeks as storage tanks and the pipeline are full. As such an assessement of no recent business has been applied to the €173-176/mt FCA
range.
Rouen: Prices plunge to €150-155/mt FCA
French UAN-30 prices fell sharply this week to €150-155/mt FCA for March/April positions.
The French UAN market remains 90% covered for the season ending April as participants hold off from buying the remainder with a belief that prices have not yet reached their floor.
Price ideas for May/June fell €10/mt to around €145/mt FCA.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Abu Qir issues another UAN tender
Abu Qir issued a new export tender for 25,000 mt UAN closing February 8 for loading from Damietta February 11-15 dates.
The producer is targeting a price of $140/mt FOB in this session following its 5,000 mt sale to Trammo at this level in its January 26 tender. Should the producer fail to sell its 25,000 mt, it may elect to cut UAN production.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Markets to remain quiet for the next fortnight
Upcoming Chinese New Year holidays are expected to create a lull in the UAN market until the end of February.
According to reports, Chinese UAN producers Jinkai and Huaihua will recommence limited production after the holidays to build up inventories until 40-50,000 mt of UAN is available for spot sale.
Producers suggest they will target $150/mt FOB in future sales but buyers contest they are looking for product priced nearer $145/mt FOB.
AS
NORTH AMERICA
US S. Plains: AS values hold after prior plunge
After the sharp decline in ammonium sulphate postings in the south at the end of January, distributors have held steady at $220-230/st FOB in the last couple of weeks. Seasonal demand will not emerge for another few weeks, and peak AS use in the south usually coincides with the first urea application on the rice crop, when the two products are blended.
Mexico: Jump in AS imports from Belgium
Mexican AS imports for November 2015 were just 23 mt, a decrease of 100% on the same period in 2014.
Total imports for the January-November 2015 period registered 213,982 mt, down 20% year-on-year.
Mexican imports from Belgium for the first 11 months of this year grew significantly reaching 144,069 mt, up on the mere 17,000 mt recorded for 2014.
Off-take from Belarus was 16,886 mt, up 62%.
Due to Mexican sanctions on AS originating from China and US, imports from these countries have slumped. Off-take from China reached just 6,500 mt for January-November 2015, a 96% decline on the prior year, while imports from the US were just 416 mt, down 99% year-on-year.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Little interest in AS now
Brazilian demand for AS is slow as buying for the Safrinha crop continues to wind down. Offers for caprolactam grade AS from China are now reported available at the $130/mt CFR level although there is little business done.
Safrinha corn plantings are now over 3% complete in Mato Grosso and Parana. Plantings are expected to be pushed beyond the ideal planting window, which ends February 20, due to unprecedented forward sales and current record high prices. This is expected to help boost nearby farm fertilizer demand, draining some pipeline inventories.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: KemorovoAzot AS sale into Turkey
KemerovoAzot is linked to the sale of 6-8,000 mt caprolactam grade AS into Turkey, possibly to Gemlik. Reports at press time suggest business was concluded at $130/mt FOB equivalent although other market sources contend this level is too high.
Russia: Reduced availability prompts fall in exports
Russia AS exports for November 2015 were 32,189 mt, a 49% decrease on the prior year period.
Total shipments for the January-November 2015 period reached 510,841 mt, a fall of 26% on reduced availability.
Russia exports to Ukraine during the first 11 months of this year were 178,083 mt, up 17% year-on-year.
Shipments to Turkey for the period were 140,977 mt, down 40%.
Exports to Brazil more than halved at 42,422 mt as
China shipped more to the south American country.
EUROPE
Finland: Norilsk Nickel offering 6-8,000 mt AS
Finland’s Norilsk Nickel is reportedly in the freight market for 6-8,000 mt steel grade AS to load for prompt shipment from Pori to Samsun for Toros.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Interest in AS dries up
Interest in Chinese AS has dried up with producers in little hurry to sell before Chinese New Year celebrations. Last known sales for caprolactam grade AS were concluded in the $103-108/mt FOB range in recent weeks but product is now reported available at an even $100/mt FOB.

ANALYSIS
Suppliers pushed to concede discounts east of Suez
Further falls are noted east of Suez as buyers push for values closer to the equivalent of the Tampa February number at $310/mt CFR. Reports of ample supply in the region are helping their cause with suppliers seemingly left with little choice but to concede discounts to stimulate March sales.
Yara’s 15,000 mt sale to Namhae at $347/mt CFR surprised some regional traders who felt the drop in
values too sharp. Others argued that it accurately represented a market awash with supply as Sabic and
Petronas are still reported to have spot cargo available. It has also been suggested that Indonesia’s Pupuk
Kaltim may switch from urea to greater ammonia output potentially compounding the ample supply situation, but this was not confirmed at the time of writing.
BASF China and FACT will certainly be hoping for lower offers in import tenders for 8,000 mt and 15,000 mt respectively which close February 5, after CJ Indonesia secured 6,000 mt spot cargo from Petrokimia Gresik
at $368/mt CFR. A number of Indian buyers claim recent offers to FACT at $410/mt CFR under scrapped tenders have kept suppliers’ price ideas unrealistically high with no new offers below the $340-360/mt CFR
range for spot enquiries. CIL said it will hold out for ammonia values around $320/mt CFR before securing a small spot parcel for March delivery.
Black Sea suppliers contend that although the market remains tough in February/March, prices are stable at $260-270/mt FOB with no urgency to sell product. OPZ remains shut on one ammonia line as Ameropa busies itself with contract commitments. Sorfert continues to run just one ammonia line while Fertial is also reported to be running just one ammonia line in Arzew due to export licence issues.
Despite this, buyers appear reluctant to conclude spot business west of Suez should prices fall further, citing limited demand and low prices for other fertilizers. The market will watch with interest at what price Turkey’s
Gemlik must offer at to spur buying interest for possible exports after restarting ammonia production this week.
Mosaic's announcement this week of a Q1 production cut of up to 400,000 mt of finished phosphates in the US was expected, and it naturally means the phosphate giant will need less ammonia through March. The timing means it is unlikely that international suppliers will be in a position to extract a price increase at Tampa for March deliveries. Somewhat surprisingly, while speculation of a possible production cut by Mosaic was rumoured for months, similar rumours have not emerged with regard to ammonia output in Trinidad and Tobago, the main supplier of ammonia to the US Gulf.
Ammonia producers have cut prices by $10-22/st in all key US enduser markets, although new quotes from suppliers vary somewhat even within regions. The move is likely aimed at making up for some of the lost demand seen last fall, when wet weather substantially reduced the application window for ammonia, especially in the Midwest.
Highlights of the week:
∙CJ Indonesia tender awarded to Petrokimia Gresik at $368/mt CFR
∙BASF China closing 8,000 mt import tender February 5
∙Namhae buys 15,000 mt from Yara at $347/mt CFR
∙Pupuk Kaltim may reduce urea output in favour of ammonia
∙FACT issues 15,000mt retender closing February 5
∙Mitsui buys 3,000 mt KAFCO cargo under formula price
∙Sabic and Petronas may have spot cargo available
∙Turkey's Gemlik restarts ammonia output
∙Fertial running one ammonia line at Arzew due to export licence issues
∙Black Sea quiet; prices stable at $260-270/mt FOB
Short term outlook
Stability west of Suez although downwards price pressure remains. There is room for further falls east of Suez as buyers push for lower values on ample supply.
DAP versus ammonia
Mosaic announced long awaited DAP/MAP production cuts this week as market prices again tumbled on weak demand and high stocks. The company plans to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns, which could ease the demand for ammonia.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam values fell to $1,050-1,100/mt CFR China this week, the lowest the index has been according to CRU records dating back to July 2004.
MARKETS
AMMONIA
NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Mosaic cut hits demand
A rough estimate of lost US Gulf ammonia demand during Q1 is 73,000 mt, assuming Mosaic cuts finished phosphate production by the maximum indicated figure of 400,000 mt. However, the likely figure is more difficult to estimate compared to prior years as the company has not provided more details of the likely reduction betweek DAP, MAP and its MicroEssentials line. All tnese products consume various amounts of nitrogen and the company does not provide precise details on its MicroEssentials output.
US Northern Plains: Ammonia slightly lower
There no consistent reports out of the Dakotas regarding ammonia values, with some suppliers suggesting price cuts in the region are not as aggressive as seen in other regions. Sellers would only admit to about a $10/st decline from prior weeks to $490/st FOB. However, there remains time for buyers to push for cuts that more closely reflect ammonia costs seen in other US markets.
US S. Plains: More aggressive offers
Producers are backing lower prices for ammonia to ship on a prompt and forward basis in Oklahoma, Texas, southern Kansas and elsewhere. Prices have declined an average of $22/st from late January to $315-330/st FOB, according to distributors in the region.
Orders for ammonia are coming in based on these offers, with deliveries likely to be spread from coming weeks into March for use as pre-plant applications on corn acres.
US NOLA: Barge indications narrow
Inland ammonia resale values dropped this week, which cut into the potential return available for ammonia barges in the US Gulf and leaving the current week's range at $301-330/st FOB New Orleans.
The decline in the average price was only $10/st over the last week. However, that drop was the result of $20/st being subtracted entirely from the top end of last week's range of $301-350/st FOB.
US Midwest: Some suppliers offer cheaper ammonia
Not all suppliers are matching up, but prompt ammonia offers are more aggressive from some US producers and traders this week. Midwest retailers are finding offers from river and pipeline terminals at $430/st FOB this week, down $20/st from prior indications.
There are rumors of sales at even lower levels, based on trucked ammonia from plants farther afield, but there also are postings remaining at $450/st FOB from some sellers.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: November 2015 exports recover to 2013 levels
Russian ammonia exports for November 2015 were 300,009 mt, up on the 111,823 mt exported in the same period in 2014, and more or less in line with exports for 2013.
Total exports for the January-November 2015 period were
3.2million mt, up 3% year-on-year boosted by increased shipments to Belgium and Finland.
The largest recipient of Russian ammonia during the first 11 months of 2015 was Ukraine at 2.1 million mt, including product transported by pipeline to Odessa for export.
Another 540,694 mt was destined to Belgium during the period, up 104%.
Russia exported 215,392 to Finland, up 9% on the prior year.
Black Sea: No new trade; Ameropa charters Solaro
Another quiet week in the Black Sea with values assessed stable at $260-270/mt FOB. Ameropa has chartered the Solaro for 2-3 months to cover freight requirements.
The vessel is slated to arrive in Yuzhnyy February 18 to load 25,000 mt, possibly for GCT Tunisia.
Koch’s Clipper Orion sailed February 3 with 30,000 mt OPZ product and 10,000 mt from Ameropa for SFC
and Namhae in South Korea.
EUROPE
Turkey: Gemlik restarts output
Local reports suggest Gemlik restarted ammonia production this week after suspending output mid- December due to low AN values. It possible that Gemlik is now receiving cheaper gas compared with the end of 2015 due to gas contracts linked to lower oil values, making ammonia production more viable despite current prices pegged no higher than $300/mt CFR Turkey.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Algeria: Fertial runs just one ammonia line
Fertial is reported running just one ammonia line at Arzew following issues securing exports licences.
Sorfert still has one ammonia down at its Arzew plant.
Saudi Arabia: Sabic may have additional cargo
Reports suggesting Sabic has an additional cargo outside contract commitments for March lifting have not been confirmed by the producer.
Meanwhile, it is suggested that Qafco is experiencing technical issues at Qafco IV.
Middle East spot values have been assessed indicatively at $275-280/mt FOB on netbacks on Yara's 15,000 mt sale to Namhae at $347/mt CFR, taking into account freight costs of around $70/mt.

Bangladesh: Mitsui purchases 3,000 mt from KAFCO
Mitsui purchased 3,000 mt spot cargo from KAFCO under a formula pricing arrangement for lifting on the Gashcem Dollart February 5-6. The cargo will be taken to Singapore where Mitsui has a contract supply agreement.
India: Iran ammonia imports down, but Qatar up
Indian ammonia imports in November 2015 were registered by customs at 197,542 mt, a 13% increase on the same period in the prior year on greater volumes sourced from Qatar and Russia via Ukraine.
Total imports for the January-November 2015 period reached 1.9 million mt, an increase of 8% year-on year.
India sourced the majority of its ammonia during the first 11 months of this year from Iran at 575,334 mt, a 5% decrease on 2014.
Imports from Qatar were 411,929 mt, up 22%, while off- take from Russia shipped via Ukraine leapt 73% to 376,807 mt.
India: FACT retender closes February 5
Indian importer FACT retenders February 5 for 15,000 mt ammonia to be delivered to Cochin in two lots late February and first half March. This follows the scrapping of its February 1 session which attracted no offers.
Its January 21 tender for the same volume was also scrapped as offers for the two lots by Trammo and Muntajat at an identical $410/mt CFR basis sight payment were considered substantially in excess of actual spot values.
CIL said it will wait for ammonia values to fall to $320/mt CFR or below before securing a small spot parcel for March delivery.
Zuari said it shut down its ammonia and urea plants for maintenance from January 26, 2016. It is unclear how long the turnaround will last.

ANALYSIS
Mosaic cuts production as price collapse continues
Mosaic announced long awaited DAP/MAP production cuts this week as market prices again tumbled on weak demand and high stocks.
The US company plans to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns. With phosphates prices and sentiment collapsing in markets around the world, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best moment for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system. However, many sources think the cut does not go far enough and that it will remain a difficult task for producers to stabilise and possibly raise some DAP/MAP prices by the end of the first quarter.
Mosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market. Without any new sales, the company's DAP/MAP Tampa price is assessed at $350- 360/mt FOB. The US domestic benchmark at New Orleans remained essentially flat week over week.
In the last two weeks more than 100,000 mt of spot MAP/DAP has been committed to the US between EuroChem and PhosAgro. These cargos are in addition to two 50,000 mt MAP/DAP cargos previously booked by Koch with OCP. Another international trader is shopping for Russian phosphates to load in February for the US if enough US buyers will commit to purchases.
The Brazilian MAP market again saw declines this week as Indagro sold off further Saudi Arabian tonnage as low as $325/mt CFR. In the last two weeks, Brazil's MAP import price has reduced by as much as $35/mt. Demand remains slow to build. Brazil's consumption of all P2O5 products in the full year 2015 fell to
4.4million mt from 4.8 million mt in 2014 and imports of MAP to Brazil fell 23% to 2.3 million mt during the year, according to new ANDA data. Most sources suspect that there could be further declines to go in Brazil but that such low levels are likely to encourage buying later in the quarter.
European DAP prices also saw slight reductions this week. Demand for DAP is still slow across the continent and prices are quoted at the reduced level of around $425/mt FCA across northern Europe. EuroChem has sold the final 10,000 mt DAP from Lifosa left for February shipment to northern European markets at around $410/mt FOB while GCT has sold 3,000-4,000 mt DAP to Italy at $420/mt FOB. JPMC and GCT likely each have around 100,000 mt DAP being stockpiled due to weak sales and their prices have reduced again to spur on activity.
In early January, OCP failed to continue to achieve its price goal of $450/mt FOB in Europe. As a result its allocation of DAP for European markets was reduced to 50,000 mt from 80-100,000 mt. The company continues to hold around the same price level and notes that it will manage its DAP allocation to demand and not accept current low prices in Europe. Despite this, the Moroccan DAP price has been indicatively reduced to $420-430/mt FOB due to market levels.
Vast stocks of DAP continue to impact the market in India. There is little import business expected until the end of Q1 when new Nutrient Based Subsidy rates are announced. A 15,000 mt DAP vessel arrived this
week for Blue Deebaj from Chinese producers, which was previously reported at around $390-395/mt CFR and Ma'aden has also confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with February or March shipment. Traders and importers are now assessing DAP prices at $370-380/mt CFR based on global prices after recent reductions in other markets. Current Indian DAP prices are assessed in the $380- 395/mt CFR range with downward pressure.
Export levels from China further reduced this week as the lunar New Year approaches. The Malaysian National Farmer's Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR from a Chinese producer while a Thai buyer is believed to have purchased 15,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer, although this is not confirmed. The Thai buyer had asked for $380/mt CFR. While larger producers have reduced some production and are holding export sales at $390/mt FOB as they await the domestic season, smaller producers in Hubei have had to make export sales as low as $368/mt FOB in order to keep up revenues, which has dragged down export prices.
Despite the weaker price environment, Saudi Arabia's Ma'aden confirmed over 210,000 mt of sales for the coming two months. The shipments include DAP sales to India, Southeast Asia and East Africa, an MAP sale to Australia and mixed DAP/MAP shipments under formula pricing to Brazil and Argentina/Uruguay. Prices for the DAP sales are quoted in the $380-400/mt FOB range. Sabic is currently indicating prices in the $370s/mt FOB and has postponed DAP/MAP availability to the beginning of March due to slow demand.
Mosaic's Q1 cutback seems unlikely to change much in the near term. Global stocks remain high and demand has yet to jump in major markets. Sentiment has reduced significantly in recent weeks leading PhosAgro's chief executive Andrey Guryev to say this week that DAP prices are likely to fall a further 10% in the next few weeks. Suppliers hope that the Mosaic cut, coupled with a return in demand for a range of markets at the end of Q1 can offset the recent price pressure.

Sulphur
There were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February. The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq's $30/mt reduction of its Qatar sulphur price to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its official selling price to $105/mt FOB. Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downwards pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.
Ammonia
Further falls are noted east of Suez as buyers push for values closer to the Tampa February number of $310/mt CFR. Reports of ample supply in the region are helping their cause with suppliers seemingly left with little choice but to concede discounts to stimulate March sales.
Agricultural Developments
Wheat prices moved lower this week, on reduced export demand, but offset by small gains in corn, soybean and rice prices.
Soybean harvest in Brazil has progressed beyond 4% completion, according to Ag Rural. Combine Harvesting in Mato Grosso was seen at 8% complete (11% same time last year). Reported yields have so far been mixed, and the USDA attaché in Brazil this week lowered their soybean production forecast to 98 million mt. This remains a record volume, but below the 100 million mt originally forecast.
Safrinha corn plantings are now over 3% complete in Mato Grosso and Parana. Plantings are expected to be pushed beyond the ideal planting window, which ends February 20. This is due to unprecedented forward sales and current record high prices. This will help to boost nearby farm fertilizer demand, draining some pipeline inventories.
Crop conditions in Argentina have turned dryer over the past two weeks. If this dry period is extended, yields of both soybeans and corn may be impacted, as both crops are in critical development stages.
Rice prices in Thailand increased to a six month high this week. Low water availabilities added some worries to the upcoming cropping season and may be detrimental to fertilizer demand.
Wheat planting in India inched higher through the week, with planted area now 29.3 million hectares, 5% below the same time last year.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US S. Plains: DAP quotes lower due to lack of interest
DAP is not moving from warehouses in the southern US east or west of the Mississippi River yet, but distributors have been tempted to lower posted prices in hopes of attracting demand. At press time, quotes for DAP from warehouses along the Arkansas River were at $355/st, while inland locations south of Mason- Dixon typically were $360/st FOB. The low end of this range is $15/st below last week's postings.
US Tampa: No new exports again
Mosaic is not reporting any new export sales over the past week. Its February 3 announcement of a Q1 production cut indicated it would not participate in recent low indications cited in Brazil's market. Even earlier returns possible from Brazil and other markets in South America suggest a decline in the US export indication to $350-360/mt FOB Tampa.
This week's drop indicates a decline of $20/mt from the prior week at both ends of the range. The move down puts the export price tag roughly in line with bids for March physical positions in the New Orleans barge market.
US NOLA: DAP steady after Mosaic confirms cut
At the start of the week the bid offer spread for prompt DAP barges was reported at $310-315/st FOB New Orleans. By February 4 completed business was reported at $313-326/st FOB New Orleans by traders, as bullish buying overtook bearish sentiments expressed by many traders. In addition, Mosaic claimed a single DAP barge sale at $335/st FOB, creating a $22/st spread for the week.
On average, this week's DAP New Orleans price range is $1.50/st higher than the prior week.
Meanwhile, two more PhosAgro 30-35,000 mt cargos are planned for the US, both believed destined for United Suppliers. EuroChem also is in the freight market to load 50,000 mt of MAP for the US. These vessels are expected to arrive by the end of March.
USA: Mosaic finally announces phosphate cuts
Mosaic finally came through with its expected market related production cut announcement February 3. It said it intends to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns.
Mosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market.
Some traders were disappointed that the company hedged its plans by not committing to the full 400,000 mt of cuts, and instead said only that it would reduce by up to that volume.
Nevertheless, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best time for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system and up to 60 days before field work for most spring planting will be underway. While some further cargos from Morocco and possibly the FSU are expected to arrive in coming weeks, traders probably will not be able to add spot cargos from China to the US import lineup.
US Midwest: Modest demand yields lower prices
Modest phosphate sales volumes are typical in winter, but Midwest distributors have been willing to reflect lower replacement costs for DAP and MAP in recent weeks by cutting resale prices to retailers.
Over the last week, sales prices have slipped about $10/st to as low as $360/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River.
Mexico: DAP/MAP prices fall in new deal
Fertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The shipment is priced on a formula.
The company continues to negotiate one 40,000 mt mixed DAP/MAP/TSP cargo to Chile which is likely to load in early March.
Fertinal's current DAP/MAP price levels are quoted at 370/mt FOB as the company benefits from higher prices in the Australian buying season and as it avoids sales to the low priced Brazilian market.
Mexico: DAP/MAP/TSP exports drop 19% in 2015
Mexico exported 620,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP between January and November against 762,000 mt in the same period in 2014, representing a 19% reduction, according to GTIS.
MAP exports reached 263,000 mt during the period with 105,000 mt to Australia, 76,000 mt to Chile and 58,000 mt to Argentina. DAP exports reached 138,000 mt during the period with 41,000 mt to Argentina, 36,000 mt to Chile, 20,000 mt to Australia and 26,000 mt to Cuba and Ecuador combined.
TSP exports reached 219,000 mt including 93,000 mt to Chile, 90,000 mt to Argentina, 17,000 mt to the US and 16,000 mt to Brazil.
In December, Fertinal is believed to have exported 70,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP, bringing its full year DAP/MAP/TSP exports to almost 700,000 mt, which would be a fall of 13% against the full year 2014.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Colombia: DAP/MAP imports up 7% Jan-Nov
Colombia imported 303,832 mt DAP/MAP between January and November 2015, a 7% increase on the same period 2014, according to GTIS.
Between January and November, Colombia imported 160,120 mt DAP, 12% more than the same period a year earlier. During the 11 months, Colombia imported 134,827 mt from the US, 7% higher than the 125,900 mt in 2014, while Chinese producers increased import volumes to 19,075 mt from 9,281 mt.
Colombia's MAP imports reached 143,172 mt, a slight increase from 140,541 mt in the same period a year ago. US shipments fell to 123,571 mt from 127,983 mt, while imports from China rose to 16,938 mt from just 8,073 mt in 2014.
Brazil: Indagro sells MAP at $325/mt CFR
Indagro is rumoured to have sold a further 5,000 mt Saudi MAP to Fertipar at the reduced price of $325/mt CFR.
The news follows sales late last week from Indagro with Saudi MAP in the $330s/mt CFR. As a result, the Brazilian market is now quoted in the $325-340/mt CFR range.
Some sources believe the sale clears all tonnage on Indagro's recent formula vessel with Saudi Arabian product.
This week, Ma'aden has confirmed a further DAP/MAP cargo to Brazil under formula pricing with February or March shipment.
Recent sales for Latin America to traders or distribution channels by OCP, Saudi producers and PhosAgro have hit the market in another demand glut and Brazilian MAP prices plummeted.
Many suspect that the reduced prices, along with recent news that new credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, should boost demand by the end of the month or into March, which should at least stabilise the current price fall
Brazil: Full year P2O5 consumption down 7.4%
Brazil's consumption of all P2O5 products in the full year 2015 fell to 4.4 million mt from 4.8 million mt in 2014, according to ANDA data.
Imports of MAP to Brazil fell 23% to 2.3 million mt during the year, DAP imports fell to 395,000 mt from 739,000 mt, TSP imports fell to 868,000 mt from 938,000 mt and SSP imports fell to 564,000 mt from 608,000 mt.
Despite the reduced consumption and imports, domestic production of some granular phosphate products increased. MAP production rose 4% to 654,000 mt while SSP production rose 3% to 910,000 mt. However, TSP production fell 6% to 406,000 mt.
Argentina: DAP prices reduce on market prices
Sources from Argentina indicate that the recent collapse in Brazilian MAP prices has in turn reduced the expectations for DAP prices to Latin America.
As a result, the Argentina DAP spot price has been indicatively reduced to $360-370/mt CFR pending new deals.
Ma'aden has confirmed a further 50,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo to Argentina/Uruguay under formula pricing with February or March shipment.
Following the recent change of leadership in Argentina, many sources at FLA Colombia were buoyant that Argentine fertilizer buying will recover over the coming years after declines under the previous leadership.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Prices decline further on new sales
EuroChem sold its 10,000 mt DAP remaining for February shipment from Lifosa to northern European markets.
Last DAP sales to Northern Europe are believed to have been around $410/mt FOB.
There are expectations from some sources that northern European bids may have fallen to as low as $410- 415/mt FCA, but EuroChem is still holding its Lifosa DAP prices at around $410/mt FOB.
The company is planning a turnaround at the Lifosa plant for around three weeks starting in March, which is likely to reduce normal DAP tonnage by 40-50,000 mt.
EuroChem is also believed to have sold a 40,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo from Kingisepp to the US or Latin America but prices are currently unconfirmed.
The sale would leave EuroChem with around 20,000 mt DAP and 60,000 mt MAP remaining from Kingisepp for February shipment.
EuroChem had said it may seek to reduce DAP/MAP production if prices remain depressed in Brazil but the company has yet to make any extra production cuts.
Last week, PhosAgro sold a 24,000 mt DAP cargo to Turkey's Igsas at $390/mt CFR with duty unpaid and likely 270 days credit.
Based on current market prices and the new sales the Baltic/Black Sea DAP spot price has declined to $340-410/mt FOB and the Baltic/Black Sea MAP price has fallen to $330-340/mt FOB.
Russia: PhosAgro CEO sees more falls in fert prices
The current decline in fertilizer prices is likely to continue, likely driving some high-cost Chinese producers out of business, PhosAgro's chief executive officer told Reuters on February 4.
Prices for phosphate, potash and nitrogen fertilizers are likely to weaken by at least another 10% in the next few weeks, Chief Executive Officer Andrei Guryev said.
High stocks, weaker currencies, lower commodity prices and limited demand in a range of markets have dragged down fertilizer prices, but Guryev said a further fall may push out some Chinese producers, helping to ease those stocks and lift prices later in 2016.
"Sometimes, it is quite positive for the market to drop one level down because that is the only way to find a lift which will take you up," Guryev said.
Prices for DAP may decline by 10% to $320/mt on an FOB basis but would likely recover to around $400/mt FOB later in the year, he added.
PhosAgro increased output by 1 million mt in the last two years to 6.8 million mt and plans to continue growing production.
EUROPE
Europe: DAP market prices reduce slightly
Demand for DAP is still slow in Europe but prices are quoted at the reduced level of around $425/mt FCA across northern Europe. Sources indicate that European buying may build later in Q1.
EuroChem have sold the final 10,000 mt DAP from Lifosa left for February shipment to northern European markets.
In early January, OCP failed to continue to achieve its price goal of $450/mt FOB in Europe. As a result its allocation of DAP for European markets was reduced to 50,000 mt from 80-100,000 mt. The company continues to hold around the same price level and notes that it will manage its DAP allocation to demand and not accept current low prices in Europe.
Despite this, based on current global market DAP prices, the Moroccan spot DAP price has been indicatively reduced to $420-430/mt FOB pending new sales.
GCT and JPMC are offering around $400-420/mt FOB to Europe in February, with GCT confirmed to have sold 3,000-4,000 mt DAP to Italy at $420/mt FOB.
Some sources note that new bids from European buyers have reduced to the $390-410/mt CFR range.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Saudi Arabia: Sabic postpones sales as prices fall
Sabic postponed DAP/MAP availability to the beginning of March as demand remains weak across key markets.
Sabic says its price ideas are now $370-380/mt FOB.
Ma'aden have confirmed a range of shipments for the next two months totalling around 210,000 mt DAP/MAP.
The company has confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with a likely netback of around $385/mt FOB RAK and a 15-20,000 mt DAP sale to East Africa at around $400/mt FOB RAK.
In addition, Ma'aden has agreed a 22,000 mt DAP sale to a Southeast Asian buyer at $390/mt FOB RAK.
The company has two mixed DAP/MAP cargoes to Latin America (one shipment to Brazil and one to Argentina/Uruguay) at formula pricing totalling around 100,000 mt. Ma'aden also has signed a 40,000 mt shipment, likely MAP, to Australia also at formula pricing.
Ma'aden has also signed government-to-government agreements with Bangladesh for granular phosphate shipments in 2016 and plans to start executing sales in the next 1-2 months.
DAP prices are currently assessed at $370-395/mt FOB from Saudi Arabian producers.
Saudi Arabian MAP has recently been sold in Brazil by Indagro in the $325-340/mt CFR range.
Jordan: Sales still slow, indicative prices decline
There are no confirmed new DAP sales from Jordan this week and with market prices falling dramatically, the Jordan export price has also dropped on an indicative basis.
The country exported just 25,000 mt DAP of its 80,000 mt allocation for the combined months of December and January and is likely to now have around 100,000 mt DAP in stock.
JPMC plans to carry out a month-long turnaround at its operations in March.
With indications that new European levels may have slipped below $420/mt CFR and following the news of a Russian cargo to Turkey at $390/mt CFR, the Jordan DAP export price has declined on an indicative basis to $400/mt FOB.
Tunisia: Prices reduce on low demand, high stocks
GCT sold 3-4,000 mt DAP of its February allocation to Italy at around $420/mt FOB, but new offers to these markets are believed to now be around the $400/mt FOB level.
Following recent DAP sales from Russia to Turkey at $390-395/mt CFR, GCT may be offering as low at $380/mt FOB to the Turkish market, although this is not confirmed.
Currently Tunisian prices are assessed in an indicative range of $400-420/mt FOB pending further deals.
GCT sold around 40,000 mt of its 60,000 mt DAP allocation in both December and January. The company is still believed to still be operating at around 60% of its 110,000 mt/month capacity and GCT's DAP stocks are currently quoted at around 100,000 mt.
Morocco: DAP prices hit more pressure
OCP continues to hold DAP prices at $440-450/mt FOB to Europe without any new sales, but the current market has dropped significantly and Moroccan export prices have been decreased to an indicative $420- 430/mt FOB.
Morocco cut its allocation for Europe in January to 50,000 mt from an expectation of 80-100,000 mt after further price declines across the continent. The company is planning for another 80-100,000 mt DAP/MAP sales to Europe in February, but says it will reduce this level again if necessary.
The company's DAP FOB values have likely been boosted by sales to African markets. OCP is aiming for 200-250,000 mt DAP/NPK/NPS shipments to African markets in February, including at least one shipment to Ethiopia, and is looking to sell 25-30,000 mt DAP/NPK into its domestic market.
However, there are indications that European DAP prices have fallen to as low as $390-430/mt CFR and OCP may soon be forced to make sales at further-reduced levels. On the other hand, OCP's strategy may help limit the current price declines before a possible demand return in some markets later in Q1.
OCP also plans to send a further DAP/MAP panamax to the US during February, but there are no February shipments planned to its distribution channel in Brazil without some improvement in consumption.
The Moroccan MAP price has been lowered to $400/mt FOB, but with no recent sales in Europe and Latin American levels indicating a netback around $70/mt below this, the level is likely to decline further.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Pakistan: No activity as Fauji begins production
Fauji has now finished the two-week turnaround at its Port Qasim plant and returned to granular phosphate production.
There are no new reported DAP imports to Pakistan. With higher than normal stocks and the possibility of reduced consumption in Q1, there are unlikely to be significant imports of DAP during the period.
Based on indications from India and recent prices from Pakistan, the DAP price has reduced to an indicative level of $395/mt CFR with further downward pressure.
India: Glut in demand reduces indicated prices
Indian DAP importers are struggling to sell on vast stocks and there is little import business expected until the end of Q1 when new Nutrient Based Subsidy rates are announced.
One 15,000 mt DAP vessel arrived this week from a Chinese producer to Blue Deebaj, which was previously reported at around $390-395/mt CFR, although the price was not confirmed.
Ma'aden has also confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with February or March shipment.
Traders and importers are now assessing DAP prices at $370-380/mt CFR based on global prices after recent reductions in other markets. Current Indian DAP prices are assessed in the $380-395/mt CFR range with downward pressure.
Most companies are expecting the DAP subsidy to be cut in a range of INR 2,000-3,000/mt ($29-44). The government may also force producers/importers to reduce the maximum retail price along with the subsidy reduction.
Many companies have revised DAP MRP's to INR 23,700-23,800/mt since January from INR 23,700- 24,000/mt in order to match with IFFCO's recent price reduction to INR 23,700/mt.
At current MRP levels and exchange rates, DAP importers are believed to have a breakeven level of around $365-375/mt CFR if the subsidy is cut in the range of INR 2,000-3,000/mt. If there is a significant reduction in the MRP as well, this level may reduce by as much as $15-25/mt.
DAP stocks remain at the very high level of 2-2.5 million mt and domestic DAP production levels are returning to normal levels after the recent reduction in phosacid prices. As a result, there are unlikely to be significant DAP imports until at least the end of Q1.
Although unconfirmed, a major domestic tender for 80,000 mt DAP in the Punjab region is believed to have received offers as much as $50/mt below the current import price assessment as suppliers and importers
attempt to clear stocks. As a result, current sentiment is that DAP import prices for India have to reduce further but that even massive price reductions are unlikely to spur on import activity for quite some time.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: FOB levels reduce as Golden Week approaches
New sales from Hubei producers and falls in market DAP prices have reduced the current Chinese FOB levels ahead of next week's New Year holidays.
Chinese producers are believed to have secured sales to Southeast Asia this week. The Malaysian National Farmer's Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR from a Chinese producer while a Thai buyer is believed to have purchased 15,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer, although this is not confirmed. The Thai buyer had asked for $380/mt CFR.
Market DAP prices in India are now indicatively assessed as low as the $380/mt CFR level with downward pressure and little buying activity expected during the first quarter.
As a result, Chinese export DAP prices are assessed in the $368-$378/mt FOB range although many of the larger producers continue to hold levels at around $390/mt FOB and are focusing on the domestic market.
While larger producers have reduced some production and are holding export sales as they await the domestic season, smaller producers in Hubei have had to make export sales in a time of little demand in order to keep up revenues, which has dragged down export prices.
The domestic market for DAP remains slow and has now effectively stopped with all of the transport systems in use for mass migration during the Chinese New Year holidays.
Despite this, domestic prices remain stable on a price guarantee basis this week and most sources expect that the domestic market will see at least a month's worth of strong buying activity after the New Year, keeping much of the Chinese DAP out of export markets until around April.
Regarding MAP, Chinese producers have managed to keep up some export sales to the ongoing seasonal buying in Australia but there are no new exports to Brazil. Chinese producers have no current plans to send to Brazil as current market prices are too low compared to their domestic market or the Australian sales.
The domestic MAP market also remains largely inactive with many NPK plants already announcing that they have completed their sourcing of raw materials for upcoming production after the Chinese holidays. Activity should increase following the New Year.
Australia: MAP prices quoted relatively high
Indications from the Australian MAP market imply that prices in the on-going buying season are currently at significantly better netbacks to suppliers than the weak levels seen in Brazil.
China's Wengfu and YTH are believed to still be sending MAP to their distribution channels in Australia and sources quote prices for MAP at around $390/mt CFR.
Mexico's Fertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The cargo is priced on a formula.
High competition is reportedly taking place for sales in Australia, with more Chinese producers recently achieving Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) recognition, adding to the number of companies accepted to export granular phosphates to Australia.
As a result, other countries which export to Australia, such as Mexico and Saudi Arabia, are expected to have lost market share to Chinese producers during the season.
Regarding exports, there are no new sales reported from Australia's Incitec Pivot but with new price ideas reducing across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, export DAP prices have reduced on an indicative basis to $370-380/mt FOB.
Southeast Asia: Nafas gets DAP in $380s/mt CFR
The Malaysian National Farmer’s Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR.
The DAP is believed to be of Chinese origin and is likely to be for prompt shipment, although this is not confirmed.
It is unclear whether the 15,000 mt DAP asked for by a Thai buyer last week has been purchased. The buyer asked for $380/mt CFR. A Thai buyer recently purchased 10,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer at $388/mt CFR.
In addition, Ma'aden has agreed a 22,000 mt DAP sale to a Southeast Asian buyer at $390/mt FOB RAK or around $400/mt CFR with February or March shipment. Further details were not available at press time.
Philippines: DAP/NPK imports rise on Philphos closure
The Philippines imported 90,000 mt DAP between January and October 2015, an increase from 54,000 mt on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. The vast majority of the DAP came from Chinese producers.
The country also imported 145,168 mt NPKs during the ten months of 2015, a decline of 8% from 159,124 mt previously. Of this volume, 47,404 mt NPKs were shipped from Vietnamese producers, 30,000 mt from Yara, 26,738 from Namhae.
Imports of NP products also rose to 107,776 mt from 70,310 mt previously, including 104,838 mt from Chinese producers.
The Philippines did not export any DAP/NPK/NPs in 2015.
Philippines producer Philphos remains out of action after damage caused by Cyclone Haiyan in November 2013. According to Filipino news agency InterAksyon the plant's machinery remains intact and its granulation plant is back in working condition, but Philphos is not believed to have purchased raw material for production at this point.
Recent news reports have suggested that Philphos has struggled to collect insurance for the damage and may have defaulted on some of its interest and principal payments since the supertyphoon.
New Zealand: DAP and Rock imports decline
New Zealand's DAP imports during 2015 reached 238,000 mt, a 20% decline on 297,000 mt previously, according to GTIS.
Chinese DAP shipments increased to 183,000 mt from 151,000 mt, increasing its market share to 77% from 51% in 2014. US producers increased DAP shipments to 46,000 mt from zero but shipments from Incitec Pivot in Australia fell to 7,000 mt from 59,000 mt in 2014.
Phosphate rock imports also declined 10% to 638,000 mt from 712,000 mt in 2014. South Africa shipped 67,000 mt compared with 63,000 mt previously, while Vietnam loaded 58,000 mt against 65,000 mt, Jordan
failed to send any rock to New Zealand after sending 59,000 mt in 2014. OCP increased its New Zealand rock sales to 440,000 mt from 398,000 mt.
Japan: China increases DAP shipments in 2015
Japan imported 367,000 mt DAP in 2015, a 2.3% increase from 359,000 mt during 2014, according to customs data via GTIS.
Chinese producers increased shipments to Japan by 25% to 197,000 mt in 2015, while US producers loaded 130,000 mt, down from 154,000 mt the previous year.
Saudi, Moroccan and Jordanian producers reduced total shipments to Japan to 40,000 mt DAP from 47,000 mt previously.
Japan's phosphate rock imports reached 293,000 mt in 2015, a fall from 313,000 mt in 2014. During the period, OCP shipped 53,000 mt rock, Chinese producers 72,000 mt, South Africa loaded 70,000 mt, Jordan 53,000 mt, Nauru 20,000 mt and Vietnam shipped 21,000 mt.
Japanese NPK imports in 2015 are seen at the lowest level since 1994 at 76,907 mt. A 35% fall from 117,545 mt in 2014.
NPK imports from South Korean producers fell to 32,138 mt from 60,485 mt an almost 50% decline. Imports from China declined to 25,770 mt from 27,784 mt and imports from Yara fell by 500 mt.
TSP
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Market’s TSP indications fall
In response to both reduced MAP prices in Brazil and lower TSP prices in other markets like Europe, TSP prices on an indicative basis to Brazil have reduced.
Currently TSP is quoted by sources in the $300-320/mt CFR Brazil range but there have been no recent deals.
Consumption for SSP was largely flat during 2015 in Brazil but TSP levels are said to have fallen significantly. According to ANDA, TSP imports fell to 868,000 mt in full year 2015 from 938,000 mt previously while TSP production fell 6% to 406,000 mt.
PHOSPHORIC ACID
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Plans advance for phosphate complexes
Egypt is advancing plans to develop its phosphates sector with two major new complexes, the first of which is scheduled to begin construction this month.
Both projects are driven by a government shift away from exporting raw materials and a new focus on the increased value of downstream products.
The El Wady complex, the least advanced of the two projects, is due to be incorporated in the coming weeks after completing its pre-feasibility study last year. The joint venture between Misr Phosphate and Abu Qir and will be constructed in two phases, with the first to focus on the production of phosphoric acid.
About 3.1 million mt of rock is required and "secured at preferential prices," according to the prospectus. The project "will be heavily supported by the Egyptian government".
Production of 518,000 mt/year phosphoric acid (MGA) is planned for Phase 1, all for export. Part of the phosacid production will be used in Phase 2 to produce 345,000 mt/year DAP/MAP, with the rest (about 207,000 mt P2O5 exported). Phase 3 is production of about 345,000 mt/year TSP.
The investment cost is estimated at $1.05 billion and strategic investors are now being sought, with the project's sponsors aiming to retain a 40% stake.
In November President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi approved the construction of El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals' phosphate and compound fertilizers complex at Ain Sokhna.
It will produce DAP, MAP, TSP, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid (see Fertilizer Week on January 16, 2015), with the fertilizers destined for the domestic market with surplus production available for export. Construction will be compressed into 30 months, El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals said in Cairo this week.
South Africa: Phosphoric acid exports plunge
South Africa exported just 147,000 mt phosphoric acid in 2015, a decline from 281,000 mt in 2014 and 431,000 mt in 2013, according to GTIS data.
During the period, South Africa's phosphoric acid exports to India were just 63,000 mt, a slight fall from 66,000 mt in 2014 and a 74% decline on the 2013 figures. In addition, sales to Turkey, Netherlands and the UAE combined declined 69% against 2014 to just 22,000 mt.
Foskor's South African plant has suffered a series of technical issues, power shortages and most recently strike action, all of which have combined to lower operating rates and cut into export availability.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Acid shipments reach 328,000 mt in January
Phosphoric acid shipments to India reached 328,000 mt P2O5 solution in January according to port data, bringing full fertilizer-year shipments to 2.6 million mt solution.
For February, the country already has 104,000 mt P2O5 solution set for delivery, including at least 20,000 mt from JPMC and 48,000 mt from OCP, port data show.
Bangladesh: BCIC announces Phosacid tender
Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corp (BCIC) has announced a tender to buy 10,000 mt +/- 10% phosphoric acid solution (52-54% P2O5), closing on March 8.
Shipment of the phosphoric acid should take place within 30 days from the receipt of L/C to BCIC's TSP jetty in Chittagong.
BCIC recently received offers on its tender for 10,000 mt +/- 10% phosphoric acid solution (52-54% P2O5) which closed on January 20. It is unclear whether the new tender is considered a retender.

Peru: Vale's rock prices under negotiation
Phoshate rock producer Vale is yet to complete its negotiations for new phosphate rock contracts from Peru.
The company is negotiating contracts to its regular buyers in India, Southeast Asia and other markets. It is expected to complete negotiations by the end of February.
Other rock suppliers, including OCP and some Egyptian companies, have reduced their rock prices by around $10/mt depending on grade and Vale is widely expected to accept a similar reduction.
Vale's current price for its 66.5% BPL rock is around $90/mt FOB depending on the market.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Misr Phosphate expands mining with three sites
Misr Phosphate is now operating three phosphate rock mines in Egypt, and recently began work at a new site.
Alongside production estimated at about 2 million mt/year for Abu-Tartour, the government-owned entity began operations at El Sibiya site close to the Red Sea two months ago, with its first shipment due to load out of Safaga.
El Sibiya produces 27-30% P2O5 rock, as well as 24-25% P2O5, Misr Phosphate said in Cairo.
The company also resumed operations at the Red Sea Mine, which produces higher-grade 30-32% P2O5 ore. There are said to be 500 workers on site and production estimates vary from 15,000 mt a month currently to about 40,000 mt.
Misr Phosphate receives only a small percentage of revenue for managing operations at the Red Sea mine but hopes to be awarded outright control in the near future.
Combined production from the three mines is estimated by the company to reach about 3 million mt/year.
Misr Phosphate and El Nasr Mining are still considering price-coordination to establish a single FOB price for each grade of rock exported from Egypt. The idea is understood to be encountering resistance from traders.
Jordan: Q1 rock contracts settle $10-13/mt lower
Jordan's JPMC has now settled most of its phosphate rock contracts with customers for the first quarter at a $10-13/mt decrease from prices in the second half of 2015, the producer said.
In India, buyers of Jordan's higher-grade rock (73-75% BPL) will pay about $120/mt FOB in Q1 with consumers in Indonesia and Japan paying as much as $125/mt FOB.
Lower-grade rock for the Indian market (68-72% BPL) was settled at around $110/mt FOB, with buyers outside India paying around $115/mt FOB. JPMC is still believed to be negotiating some final deals with Indian customers.
As a result of the new contracts and after recent news that OCP concluded its 72% BPL contract price at $130-140/mt FOB, the India (71-75% BPL) Spot/Contract price is now assessed at $126-152/mt CFR pending any further contracts.

India: Rock shipments pass 500,000 mt in January
Phosphate rock shipments to India reached 526,000 mt in January according to port data, bringing full fertilizer-year rock shipments to 6.9 million mt.
For February, the country already has 238,000 mt rock set for delivery, port data show. The February tonnage includes two shipments from OCP totalling 107,000 mt, two shipments from JPMC totalling 88,000 mt and one shipment of 44,000 mt from Algeria.

The Kenya Tea Development Agency is seeking 67,587 mt NPK 26-5-5 for 2016 and is pre-qualifying suppliers as part of a two-phase tender process, according to the agency's website.
Companies seeking prequalification must submit technical proposals by February 23, 2016.
KTDA last April bought 70,000 mt Uralchem product from Mekatrade at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.

OCP aims for energy independence by 2020
Moroccan phosphates giant OCP plans to boost investments in renewable energy as it looks to achieve energy independence by 2020, according to news agency SeeNews.
The company is targeting a generation capacity of 600 megawatts by 2020 by investments in wind, solar and hydro energy along with cogeneration, the Moroccan Energy Minister Abdelkader Amara said at a mining conference last week.
Since 2010, OCP has raised co-generation capacity to 350 megawatts, which covered 60% of their electricity needs in 2015.
The news comes as King Mohammed VI inaugurated the company's JPH-1 fertilizer production hub, which is dedicated to African markets. Production at the site started at the end of 2015.
The plant is part of OCP's ambitious strategy to increase fertilizer production to 12 million mt by 2017 with a second hub set to come online by the end of Q2 2016.
LEGISLATION
Brazil receives early farm credit boost
The Brazilian government, in conjunction with Banco do Brasil (Bank of Brazil), have announced that BRL 10 billion ($2.51 billion) in credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, according to consultancy 'The Soybean and Corn Advisor'.
This early announcement of credit follows complaints in 2015, when credit was not available until May/June, significantly cutting farm budgets and fertilizer demand.
Small to medium sized farmers can receive loans for input purchasing through the National Programme to Help Medium-Sized Rural Producers (PRONAMP). Loans for BRL 710,000 ($180,000) have an interest rate of 7.75% and loans of BRL 1,200,000 ($304,350) see a rate of 8.75%. These rates are unchanged from 2015 and are significantly below free market interest rates, which are thought to be over 20%.
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
Pemex finalises Fertinal takeover
Pemex has completed its acquisition of Fertinal in Mexico, with longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Fabio Covarrubias of the phosphate producer confirming he has handed over control this week.
In a letter to Fertinal employees, Covarrubias said government controlled petrochemical giant Pemex was in a position to make the phosphate operation on Mexico’s west coast more vertically integrated thanks to Pemex’s ammonia capacity. This in turn should move Fertinal back into the list of low-cost phosphate
producers, he said.
The takeover will cost Pemex around $680-690 million, according to Mexican media reports.
The sale of Fertinal has been a subject of industry speculation for much of the last two decades. Ultimately this deal may prove to be more of a signal about Pemex's intentions for its nitrogen assets than anything else.
Pemex controls Petroquimica Cosoleacaque, with nearly 900,000 mt ammonia capacity on Mexico's east coast, although the units do not run at capacity. The lack of competitive ammonia freight to Mexico's west coast versus competing supplies from Trinidad and Venezuela mean the Pemex subsidiaries are not in a position to routinely supply Fertinal.
However, now that Pemex owns Fertinal it should be be easier to arbitrage deliveries to the west coast, as a way to reduce costs of delivering ammonia to the DAP, MAP and TSP producer.
PRODUCTION
PhosAgro fertilizer production increases 10%
Russian producer PhosAgro increased its total fertilizer production by 10.4% to 6.8 million mt in 2015, the company reports.
Despite a fall in commodity prices during 2015, phosphate-based fertilizer and MCP feed phosphates production rose by 12% during the period to 5.4 million mt.
PhosAgro's DAP/MAP production rose 12% to 2.6 million mt while NPK production increased 11% to 1.9 million mt. NPS production rose 10% to 272,800 mt.
Separately, phosphate rock production rose 4.7% to 7.9 million mt while phosphoric acid production as a feedstock increased 9.3% to 2.1 million mt.
Regarding nitrogen output, AN production rose 56% to 455,300 mt and urea production rose 1.3% to 978,000 mt. Ammonia production for feedstock use declined 5.8% to 1.1 million mt.
Overall sales volumes for phosphate-based fertilizers and MCP rose by 12% to 5.3 million mt but sales volumes of nitrogen-based fertilizers fell 1.4% to 1.4 million mt.
Despite some issues with demand at the start of 2015 in the Russian domestic market, PhosAgro still managed to have flat sales volumes to the domestic market during the year at 1.6 million mt of fertilizer. The company is optimistic that government support for agricultural production in Russia could boost sales in 2016.
Regarding exports, the company increased its overall fertilizer sales to Europe by over 30% to 1.3 million mt and hopes to achieve further sales in 2016. Sales to India increased dramatically, partly as a result of PhosAgro's new contract to IPL for NPK and DAP.
However, sales to the Latin American markets reduced due to low soybean prices and economic challenges facing the region.

ANALYSIS
Southeast Asia potash prices fall further
Potash prices in Southeast Asia were assessed to have dropped within the last week as the Lunar New Year is just around the corner.
Prices across Southeast Asia were stable except for Malaysia, where a major supplier confirmed a February arrival vessel of 30,000 mt at around $260/mt CFR. Although the price falls within the low end of last week's range, other indications suggest that some pressure still remains as the tender season winds down.
Vietnamese MOP prices continue to hold at the upper end of the range at $295/mt CFR although this could change in the coming weeks with Vietnam’s application season nearing. If demand in the country increases, some suppliers may attempt to push for higher prices, increasing the width of the region’s assessed range.
Some major global suppliers were hoping to talk business with Brazilian importers at last week’s FLA conference in Cartagena, Colombia but those meetings did not take place. Indications are that the price in Brazil is stable this week but confirmed deals in the $230s/mt CFR could be seen within the month if demand does not accelerate, as some traders expect it to do between now and March.
Indian importers are now expecting potash subsidy rate cuts of $22-29/mt, which would further add to their
arguments for a significantly decreased 2016 contract price. According to sources, many traders are anticipating it to be agreed at between $240-270/mt CFR. Given the country’s 1.6-1.8 million mt inventory
level, this would not be surprising and negotiations could be noticeably delayed, following as similar trend to those in China.
In China, the port wholesale price is assessed unchanged at RMB 1,980-2,200/mt FCA in the lead up to New Year festivities. Once contract talks begin, likely at the end of February, negotiations will be slow because the country does not need to bring in any foreign tonnes over the next couple months.
US potash values held relatively steady with only a modest decline reported at New Orleans for imported barges. In the Midwest, modest movement from distributors to retailers and to the fields continued this week thanks to hard ground. These pre-spring applications of potash (and phosphates) are typical this time of year. This suggests Q1 demand in the key US corn and soybean growing region of the Midwest will be in line with prior years.
Highlights of the Week:
∙Japan December MOP imports down 51% y-o-y
∙Malaysia MOP price sees $5/mt decrease
∙Brazil January through September imports down 8% y-o-y
∙US NOLA barge prices assessed lower
∙Indian importers expect higher subsidy rate cuts
∙Colombia November MOP imports up 44% y-o-y
∙Mexico November MOP imports down 72% y-o-y
Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade- weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the
spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.
MARKETS
MOP
NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: Barge offers drift lower
Imported potash barges continue to inch lower as some importers continue to accept lower bids in order to reduce their positions ahead of the expected reopening of the upper Mississippi River system in mid-late March. The bottom of this week's range was cited at $205/st FOB, although some suppliers are holding out for at least $210/st FOB.
Mexico: November MOP imports down 72%
Mexico imported 9,283 mt of MOP in November, a decrease of 72% from the same month in 2014, according to the latest customs data via GTIS.
Of this, 6,307 mt was shipped by SQM. This can be compared to November 2014, when the Chilean producer sent 12,756 mt to Mexico. Uralkali and Canpotex each loaded around 1,000 mt in November 2015.
The month’s MOP imports brought Mexico’s January through November total to 243,068 mt – 17% more
than in the same period of 2014, despite the decreased November shipments.
SQM remained the country’s largest supply partner, having shipped 94,904 during the 11 months of 2015,
compared to 70,907 mt the year before. Mexico imported 74,677 mt from Canpotex and 64,895 mt from Uralkali, respective increases of 27% and 10% from 2014.
US Midwest: Some truck sales at latest postings
New granular potash sales from distributors to retailers are sparse, but reports from the Midwest suggest the $260/st FOB price tag sought by some Canadian suppliers has been accepted in the market. So far only about a $5/st discount is indicated for some, but not all, offshore material.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Colombia: November MOP imports up 44%
Colombia imported 50,657 mt of MOP in November, a 44% increase from the same month in 2014, according to the latest GTIS data.
K+S shipped 28,829 mt to the Latin American country in November, up from 4,885 mt in November 2014. The remainder of the tonnes were shipped by Uralkali (12,760 mt) and Canpotex (7,061 mt).
January through November, Colombia imported 516,087 mt MOP, a 13% increase from the same period in
2014. Uralkali, the country’s largest supplier, shipped 234,584 mt during the 11 months of 2015, compared to
169,617 mt in 2014.
Colombia also imported 175,464 mt from Canpotex and 76,107 mt from K+S, with the former decreasing shipments by 5% and the latter increasing shipments by 69% from the same period of the previous year.
Brazil: Jan-Dec MOP imports down 8% y-o-y
Brazil imported 292,489 mt of MOP in December, down from the 657,396 mt it received in the same month of 2014, according to Anda data.
Canpotex was the country’s largest supplier with a market share of 35% for the month. BPC supplied 25% of
the imported product, while 14% came from Uralkali and 13% from K+S, according to GTIS data.
In the full year of 2015, Brazil imported 8.3 million mt MOP, a decrease of 8% compared to the 12 months of 2014. Of this, 34% of the tonnes were imported via Canpotex.
Other January through December shipment shares were held by BPC (20%), Uralkali (17%) and K+S (15%). Brazil imported the remainder of the full-year volumes from ICL and SQM, a total market share of around 12%.
Potash consumption in Brazil was up slightly in December compared to the same month of 2014. It totalled 327,501 mt, a year-on-year increase of 4%, according to Anda. However, consumption in the full year of 2015 was 5.2 million mt, down 4% from the 12 months of 2014.
Brazil’s MOP production in December was 28,113
mt, a minor decrease on the December 2014 level of 29,147 mt. The country therefore produced 279,138 mt in the full year of 2015, down just over 2% from 2014.
Some major potash suppliers were hoping to conduct business with Brazilian importers at last week’s
conference in Cartagena but this did not happen. There are now expectations that demand, and subsequently trading, will increase in March.
The business price range in Brazil remains $240- 250/mt CFR and demand is still weak, sources say. There has been a lack of indications to suggest that prices in the $230s/mt CFR deserve to form part of the range, despite previous suggestions of deals at $235/mt CFR.
On a positive note, some sources have said that farmers are starting to make more money off of their trading, which could contribute towards increased demand later on in Q1. Producers are also reportedly attempting to work with partners in the country who are not bankrupt in an attempt to make more regular agreements.
The Brazil granular bulk MOP spot price is assessed stable at $240-250/mt CFR.
EUROPE
Southeast Asia: Slight price drop following pressure
The assessed range for the Southeast Asia MOP spot price has been lowered to $255-295/mt CFR following reports of continued market pressure last week.
Prices across the region were said to be stable with the exception of Malaysia, where indications ranged from $250-260/mt CFR. According to one seller, business can be seen at as low as $250/mt CFR although there are no confirmed deals below this low end.
One major supplier confirmed a February vessel bound for Malaysia with 30,000 mt standard MOP at a price of around $260/mt CFR. There are no confirmed tenders to report in the region as the season nears its end but there could be two more that have yet to be announced, sources say.
Indonesian prices are still higher than in Malaysia at around $270-280/mt CFR based on most indications but there are no new deals to report.
In Vietnam, the high end of the current range has reportedly been maintained by suppliers despite previous suggestions that it would slip. Shipments are expected to start arriving in February, in line with the application season. Standard MOP is still seen at around $295/mt CFR, with granular priced at around $315/mt CFR, according to sources.
Europe: Demand remains weak as buying season looms
The granular MOP buying season in northwest Europe is expected to start in the next few weeks although farmers in the region remain relatively inactive for now, according to sources.
Recent rainfall in the Benelux countries has not helped the current lack of business as farmers have not been using fertilizers. Potash demand remains low, partially because farmers are in no rush to consider application.
There could be a slight rise in granular MOP prices once demand increases but this is not likely to happen until the buying season begins, sources say.
At the beginning of January, some product was flowing freely because it was ready to be transported. However, warehouses then filled, resulting in pressure on prices as producers described the need to try to move tonnes. It now appears as though previous discounted offers have failed to spur demand.
The northwest Europe granular MOP market is assessed unchanged again this week at €280-290/mt CIF
with no new confirmed business to report.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
South Africa: December MOP imports down 41%
South Africa imported 40,263 mt of MOP in December, 41% less than it did in the same month of 2014, according to GTIS data.
Chile’s SQM supplied 31,401 mt of this, 23% more than in November 2014. The lower monthly import volume can be attributed to decreased K+S shipments, which totalled 8,796 mt in November compared to 20,500 mt in November 2014.
In the full year of 2015, South Africa imported 377,367 mt of MOP, a meagre 1% drop from 2014 volumes. Of this, SQM shipped 135,362 mt, an increase of just 1,000 mt compared to 2014.
Other shipments throughout the 12 months were received from APC (90,800 mt), K+S (86,622 mt), Uralkali (41,950 mt) and ICL (17,566 mt).
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Importers expect higher subsidy rate cuts
Potash importers in India are now expecting 2016-17 subsidy rate cuts of INR 1,500-2,000 ($22-29)/mt, according to sources.
This, combined with potential discounts on the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) in the country, may result in low breakeven prices for importers, given current ideas that the 2016 contract will be agreed at somewhere between $240-270/mt CFR.
If subsidy rates are cut by $22-29/mt, importers’ breakeven would be around $225-230/mt CFR, taking MRP decreases and a US dollar to INR ratio of 1:68 into account.
Alternatively, if the subsidy rates were cut by the same range and there was a further INR 1,000 ($15)/mt decrease on the MRP of INR 16,000 ($237)/mt CFR, then importers would have a breakeven of as low as $215-225/mt CFR after considering capital requirements for four to six months due to the high inventory level.
Given how low these potential breakeven prices are next to the expected range of the new contract, importers would likely try to maintain margins through reducing MOP discounts.
Potash inventories were estimated to be 1.6-1.8 million mt as of the end of January. As a result, most suppliers are continuing to offer heavy discounts in the range of INR 2,500-3,000 ($37-45)/mt.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Lunar New Year approach slows activity
The Chinese MOP port wholesale spot price is assessed unchanged at RMB 1,980-2,200 ($301-335)/mt
FCA as the country’s residents prepare for New Year festivities.
It has become increasingly evident that negotiations over the new contract price will be difficult this year. They are expected to start at the end of February.
Large suppliers across the global markets are waiting for the benchmark that the new contract will establish, but there will be little news to report on this front over the couple weeks.
In the full year 2015, China imported more than 9 million mt of MOP for the first time since 2007. Much of this tonnage will need to be sold on before a formal agreement to bring in regular shipments over the next year is agreed.
Japan: Dec MOP imports down 51% y-o-y
Japan imported 19,150 mt of MOP in December, a decrease of 51% from the same month of 2014, according to GTIS data.
Of this amount, 8,239 mt were received from BPC, which increased its monthly market share to 43% from just 6% in 2014. Uralkali shipped 5,509 mt, up from 2,805 mt, while Canpotex decreased its shipments to just 1,536 mt from 16,174 mt in December 2014.
The December tonnes bring Japan’s full year 2015 import volume to 494,113 mt, down from 534,365 mt in the full year of 2014. Canpotex remained the country’s largest supplier despite decreasing its shipments by
11% year on year to 346,959 mt.
Other full year 2015 imported volumes were from Uralkali (43,065 mt), BPC (40,761 mt) and K+S (27,546 mt).
Philippines: October MOP imports more than triple
The Philippines imported 16,081 mt of MOP in October 2015, according to the latest customs data via GTIS. The amount is up from 5,853 mt in October 2014.
Canpotex, the largest Phillippines' largest supplier, shipped 12,027 mt in October, a 75% increase from the same month of the previous year.
Between January and October, the Philippines imported 129,095 mt of MOP, up from 106,739 mt from the same period in 2014. Of this, 61,724 mt arrived via Canpotex.

K+S cuts saline waste production by 50%
K+S cut its saline waste water production by 50% at the end of 2015, in line with the timing of its original goal to do so, according to a company press statement.
The potash producer said that it invested about €400 million ($437.2 million) in new facilities in order to
reduce the amount of saline waste that it was creating in Germany to 7 million cubic metres.
“Water protection is an integral part of our sustainable potash production and an important condition for the preservation of almost 4,500 jobs in the Werra-Fulda potash district,” K+S Managing Director Dr Rainer
Gerling said.
Further measures are expected through to 2017 via the Hessen state government’s four-phase disposal plan, which will further reduce waste water production by 1.5 million cubic metres per year.
In December, K+S was given the permission to continue with limited injections of waste at one of its potash plants into the Werra river until December 21 by the Kassel Regional Council. This was even though
the authority is not expected to complete its technical assessment of the company’s waste disposal until the summer of 2016.

ANALYSIS
Further price falls following large Middle East drops
There were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February.
The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq's $30/mt reduction of its QSP to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its OSP to $105/mt FOB.
Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downward pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.
Nonetheless, no Middle East spot offers were heard, and traders suggested that sellers had no spot availability until the end of February and were focusing on contractual volumes.
Price decreases were again reported across the board for Chinese sulphur, with falls in domestic, port, and international assessments. Many traders had already left on holiday, and the outlook for prices following the Spring Festival holidays will depend largely on how much product sellers push onto the market, as buyers in China are likely to need some tonnes for the domestic fertilizer season.
Some in the Indian market pegged prices as low as $100-105/mt CFR, but other players were sceptical. Adnoc’s OSP for February equates to the low-to-mid-$110s/mt CFR. Demand has been limited as Indian buyers have shown a preference for sulphuric acid and are currently comfortable with stock levels. India’s
November 2015 imports increased 4% year on year to 90,490 mt, though imports for the first 11 months were still down 19% at 1.25 million mt.
Meanwhile, the announcement of production cuts at Mosaic’s US phosphate operations provided another
bearish demand signal.
In contract news, Russian suppliers and Morocco’s OCP failed to reach a consensus and will therefore not settle Q1 contracts. Morocco’s other contracts settled so far have been reported ranging from the low $90s/mt to the mid-$110s/mt CFR, while Russia’s other contracts with North Africa were reportedly in the
upper $110s/mt CFR.
Russia’s November 2015 exports plunged 42% year on year, with imports for the first 11 months of the year
down 29% at 2.62 million mt.
Further European Q1 contracts were reported settled at decreases of $5/mt, though in some cases buyers continued to push for greater declines.
In other trade news, Kazakhstan’s December 2015 imports decreased 59% year on year to 163,781 mt,
leaving full-year imports down 21% to 2.75 million mt.
Highlights of the week:
∙Chinese prices drop further
∙China's imports climb 17% in 2015
∙Indian buyers steering clear of spot
∙Reliance closes latest tender
∙Some Brazil Q1 settlements at $110-115/mt CFR
∙Med prices also down
∙Some European Q1 settlements down $5/mt from Q4
MARKETS
SULPHUR
NORTH AMERICA
US Gulf: Mosaic believed to have reduced Q1 supply
Mosaic is believed to have negotiated lower liquid sulphur volumes for delivery to its US Gulf phosphate operations during Q1, but it is unclear if it has turned away all of the sulphur to cover its announced phosphate production curtailment. This is because Mosaic said it would cut up to 400,000 mt of finished products, rather than providing a specific figure.
Correction: Last week's edition of Fertilizer Week should have posted a US Tampa contract liquid sulphur price tag of $95/lt FOB. The February 28 edition did not correctly update settled Q1 business, and instead posted $110/lt FOB. FW regrets any confusion that ensued.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Kazakhstan: Exports down 21% for 2015
Kazakhstan’s December 2015 imports decreased 59% year on year to 163,781 mt, leaving full-year imports
down 21% to 2.75 million mt.
China was the main outlet for Kazakh tonnes in 2015, taking 1.34 million mt of exports, 13% less than in 2014.
China remained a key outlet in December, taking 77,384 mt of the December exports.
In December, Kazakhstan also sent 30,794 mt to Brazil, 18,000 mt to Benin, 16,000 mt to Lebanon, 11,991 mt to Lithuania, and 9,612 to Ukraine.
Kazakhstan had been increasing export volumes in
recent years as the sulphur stockpile at Tengiz was drawn down. TengizChevroil’s stockpile was fully
depleted in H1 2015, with export volumes decreasing in H2 2015.
Russia: November exports down 42% on year
Russia’s November 2015 exports of sulphur plunged 42% year on year, with imports for the first 11 months
of the year down 29% at 2.62 million mt.
The largest taker of November volumes was
Morocco, with 46,271 mt. Other key outlets were
China (25,746 mt), Israel (20,186 mt), and
Argentina (14,038 mt).
Russia’s volumes to most of its key destinations
declined in 2015 to November, although exports to Lithuania more than tripled to 198,189 mt and exports to Israel increased 40% to 115,068 mt.
Exports to the US reached 59,689 mt compared with only 10,998 mt over the same period in 2014 as the country increased its intake of solid sulphur.
Russia: Q1 contracts settled but no Morocco
Suppliers of Russian sulphur said they had settled Q1 contracts with North African buyers aside from OCP.
Settlements were reportedly in the high $110s/mt CFR.
Russian suppliers will skip Q1 contracts with Morocco.
EUROPE
Europe: Further Q1 contracts settled at minus $5/mt
European Q1 contracts for sulphur appeared to be near full settlement, with further settlements confirmed at $5/mt decreases from Q4.
Some buyers are pushing for greater decreases in the wake of the recent decline in the US contract price as well as falling prices elsewhere around the world.
European sellers had originally offered a rollover in December, but had since decreased this to minus $5/mt.
As downstream markets struggle, European sulphur buyers argue that they need to have similar raw material price decreases to their international counterparts in order to remain competitive. The US settlement at a decrease of $15/lt therefore provided extra impetus for a decrease.
But sellers have argued that the European liquid market itself is relatively balanced, with little basis for large price decreases.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
South Africa: Imports drop by a third in 2015
South Africa’s 2015 imports of sulphur were 33% lower than 2014 at 421,992 mt.
Tonnes mainly came from Saudi Arabia (35%), Kuwait (25%), Qatar (19%), and Canada (17%).
December imports were a mere 243 mt.
Foskor's phosphate plant has suffered a series of technical issues and labour disputes, and continues to have issues with power shortages, all contributing towards a lower operating rate and reduced sulphur imports.
It is worth noting, however, that some of the imports would likely have been for re-export to neighbouring Zambia, where South Africa sent 171,234 mt in 2015, 25% less than in 2014.
North Africa: Q1 sulphur contracts mostly concluded
North African Q1 contracts for sulphur supply are mostly settled, though some negotiations continued.
Contract settlements have been reported in a wide range from the low $90s/mt CFR to the upper $110s/mt CFR.
Meanwhile, Morocco’s OCP is not expected to settle Q1 contracts with Russian suppliers, as the two sides were unable to reach a consensus.
On the spot market, one source suggested that producer was being offered below $90/mt CFR, but this was not confirmed by sellers or traders.
Middle East: Spot assessed lower but business limited
Middle East spot prices were assessed lower based on sellers’ official postings as well as falling bids and
prices around the world.
However, spot availability from Middle East sellers is reportedly lacking until the end of February, with sellers focusing on contractual business.
The lower end of the range is in line with Tasweeq’s February QSP of $89/mt FOB, while the upper end is in line with Aramco’s February price of $115/mt FOB. However, the upper end of this range is unlikely to be
achievable on sales to any region in the current market, although most deem the lower end lower than is necessary to achieve sales.
UAE: Adnoc posts $105/mt FOB OSP for February
Adnoc posted an official selling price (OSP) of $105/mt FOB Ruwais for February, down $17/mt from its January level, according to market sources.
This represents a delivered price to India in the low-to-mid $110s/mt CFR.
It follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for February at $89/mt FOB Ras Laffan,
down $30/mt from its December level. Aramco posted its February price mid-January at $115/mt FOB Jubail, down $13/mt from its January price.
Qatar: Tasweeq cuts QSP to $89/mt FOB for February
Tasweeq announced its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) for February at $89/mt FOB Ras Laffan, down $30/mt from its January number.
This marks the biggest drop in the QSP since April 2014. It is well below Aramco Trading's official February price of $115/mt FOB, which the producer posted in mid-January.
Prices have been under considerable pressure as a result of weak downstream fertilizer markets as well as increased global supply.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Assessment down but business lacking
Indian spot prices were assessed down at $110-120/mt CFR following global price falls, but firm indications and business were lacking.
Some in the Indian market pegged prices as low as $100-105/mt CFR, but other players were sceptical. Adnoc’s OSP for February equates to the low-to-mid-$110s/mt CFR.
Demand has been limited as Indian buyers have shown a preference for sulphuric acid and are currently comfortable with stock levels.
Meanwhile, most sources were under the impression that Reliance’s 25,000 mt sulphur sales tender, which
closed January 28, was in fact scrapped, though this was not confirmed.
India: Imports up in November but down for 11 months
India’s November 2015 imports of sulphur increased 4% year on year to 90,490 mt, though imports for the first 11 months were still down 19% at 1.25 million mt.
Qatar supplied the majority of the November tonnes as the source of 45,374 mt.
Other sources of tonnes in November included
Kuwait (27,483 mt) and Bahrain (12,607 mt).
Qatar and Saudi Arabia were the main sources of Indian sulphur imports over the first 11 months of the year, with market shares of 34% and 28% respectively.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Price falls across the board but spot dead
Price decreases were again reported across the board for Chinese sulphur.
For international business, sources suggested conclusions around $100/mt CFR for granular product, but nothing was confirmed at this level. Some buyers were reportedly bidding around $90-95/mt CFR, and there were unconfirmed reports of offers at $100/mt CFR. Some argued that the lack of spot business meant that the real price level was $110-115/mt CFR, the upper end of which was in line with Adnoc's OSP of $105/mt
FOB, though well below Aramco’s February price of $115/mt FOB.
Sources mostly reported crushed and molten sulphur in the $90s/mt CFR. There was a third-party report of a granular deal at $85/mt CFR as well as a molten deal at $88/mt CFR for March shipment.
Some importers questioned whether they would be able to obtain product at Tasweeq’s QSP of $89/mt FOB, with many believing that the low level was offered as an opportunity for the producer’s offtakers to make up
for negative margins in previous months.
There was limited activity at all major ports, as many traders had already started taking holidays. At Nantong and Zhenjiang, granular product was offered around RMB 850-860/mt FCA, with prices at similar levels even at Qingdao, where quotes tend to be higher.
Port inventories climbed to around 1.44 million mt with traders on holiday while many consumers stopped moving product to plants from late January. Inventories may rise as high as 1.6-1.7 million mt by the end of the Lunar New Year holidays.
Domestic prices also fell further. Sinopec’s Puguang reduced its prices twice within three days, with its price at Wenzhou port down to RMB 880/mt FCA from RMB 930/mt last week and plant prices down to RMB 870/mt EXW from RMB 900/mt. The producer needs to clear as much stock as possible because of the Chinese holidays. Its inventories were around 25,000 mt at port and 60-70,000 mt at plant including granular and molten volumes.
Other refineries also lowered prices by up to RMB 70/mt.
Phosphate companies argue that sulphur prices should fall further because of downstream weakness. As these buyers will be producing at relatively high rates following the holidays for the domestic Spring season, they will need some sulphur. Price movement will therefore be highly influenced by how many tonnes sellers attempt to push into the market.
Japan: December exports down a third
Japan’s December 2015 exports of sulphuric acid plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year
exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.
The Philippines was the largest outlet for 2015 exports, taking 1.26 million mt, though this was 5% less than in 2014.
Exports to India, on the other hand, climbed to 503,372 mt from 379,532 mt.
Volumes to Chile declined to 319,910 mt from 421,635 mt, while exports to China plunged to 26,541 mt from 114,985 mt.
Most of the remaining volumes went to
Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Australia.
The Philippines was the key destination for Japanese exports in the month of December, taking 109,994 mt.
Other export destinations included India (18,098
mt), Australia (10,499 mt), and Taiwan (6,500 mt), with around 5,000 mt to each of Singapore and Vietnam.

ANALYSIS
Sellers comfortable but Asia outlook bearish
A lack of spot business persisted in global sulphuric acid markets, but for many producers and traders no news was good news as broader markets fell under further pressure.
With prices plunging yet again on sulphur and fertilizers this week, sulphuric acid remained relatively unscathed for now at least following the price drops in the latter half of 2015.
Indeed, sources viewed reported business to Brazil in the $40s/mt CFR – unchanged from or even higher than sales to the country in late 2015 – as something to be positive about. This is being helped by the lack of spot sales, for now at least, from Mexico to the likes of Brazil and Morocco.
Mexico’s exports for the first 11 months 2015 were 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014
as the Boleo mine was running producing acid with minimal internal use. For 2016 it is believed that most if not all of Boleo’s volumes have been committed to Chile.
Although Morocco’s OCP remains out of the spot market, this is at least partially because of the large volume
of pre-booked tonnes the buyer has arriving in Q1, which may have also left European producers more comfortable in the immediate term.
Spot prices for European exports of sulphuric acid were therefore assessed stable at $0-10/mt FOB Northwest Europe given a lack of new business and indications.
Market participants were more negative about Asian regions, with many pegging prices lower than the current assessment of $0-10/mt FOB Japan/South Korea and/or expecting price falls in the near future, as spot availability in the region is expected to increase.
Spot prices to India were assessed unchanged, but the country offered no spot demand as buyers were comfortable. The country has been a key outlet for Asian exports, and its November imports increased 72% year on year to 95,293 mt, with imports for the first 11 months up 66% at 1.24 million mt.
Pressure will increase on prices in Asia if the PASAR smelter in the Philippines successfully ramps up following technical issues in the wake of its restart. Exports from the Philippines for the first 10 months of the year fell 40% year on year to 131,357 mt, and the country did not export any acid in October.
Japan’s December 2015 exports of plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down
4% at 2.71 million mt.
Highlights of the week:
∙Further sources peg Brazil in $40s/mt CFR
∙Mexico exports to November up 75%
∙OCP out of spot as large volume pre-booked
∙Asian and European FOB steady for now
∙Indian demand weak
∙India imports to November up 66%
∙Japan 2015 exports down 4%
Base Metals
Base metal prices finally showed signs of stabilisation and recovery, with increases across the board driven by a weaker dollar as expectations of a further base rate hike by the Federal Reserve diminished. Indeed, copper and aluminium reached one-month highs while lead and zinc achieved their highest levels in four months. LME copper was up to $4,578/mt.
DAP & Sulphur
Some questions remain regarding Mosaic's liquid sulphur needs and sulphuric acid production during Q1. The producer's Q1 sulphur agreement is assumed to have included an adjustment to its contracted volumes to account for its reduced need to make acid. However, since Mosaic has committed only to cutting "up to" 400,000 mt of finished phosphates the possibility remains of the producer either carrying over acid into Q2 or potentially selling spot acid in Q1.
There were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February. The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq's $30/mt reduction of its QSP to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its OSP to $105/mt FOB. Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downwards pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam values fell to $1,050-1,100/mt CFR China this week, the lowest the index has been according to CRU records dating back to July 2004.
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
NORTH AMERICA
US: Spot market quiet on limited demand
The US spot market remained quiet, though sources suggested that contractual volumes continued moving.
Some argued that the domestic market was long, limiting import demand.
Meanwhile, spot prices were assessed stable in the $40s/mt CFR pending further indications.
Mexico: November exports reach 131,421 mt
Mexico exported 131,421 mt of sulphuric acid in November 2015, up 65% year on year. This brought exports for the first 11 months of the year to 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014.
The US remained the main destination for Mexican exports, taking 70,970 mt of the November volumes, most if not all of which was likely sourced from Grupo Mexico’s La Caridad smelter.
Mexico also sent 38,280 mt to Brazil and 21,780 mt to Morocco in November, having sent sulphuric acid to Morocco for the first time on record in September.
For January to November 2015, exports to Chile climbed to 225,054 mt from 39,286 mt in the equivalent period in 2014 and 45,066 mt in 2013, while exports to Brazil were up to 178,966 mt from effectively nothing in 2014 and 2013.
The increases are the result of production at the Boleo mine, which began producing copper January 17, 2015 and has been a key source of marginal acid supply.
CRU estimates that Boleo’s maximum consumption of sulphuric acid in 2015 was around 60-100,000 mt, while it is able to produce around 700,000 mt.
In recent months, length in the Chilean market forced Mexico to divert cargoes from Chile to Brazil and Morocco at exceptionally low or even negative FOB prices.
Conversely, Mexican imports for the year to November were down 2% at 168,856 mt, with 99,956 mt from South Korea, 46,086 mt from China, 18,755 mt from Japan, and 4,030 from the US. Imports from China are up from effectively nothing in previous years.
EUROPE
Europe: FOB steady as sellers comfortable
Spot prices for European exports of sulphuric acid were assessed stable at $0-10/mt FOB Northwest Europe given a lack of new business and indications.
Although some sources have suggested lower prices, particularly based on volumes previously agreed for sale to North Africa, most believe that negative FOB spot business is unlikely for now.
Sources suggest that contractual offtake remains relatively firm, while the large volumes scheduled for Q1 arrival to Morocco also leave sellers more comfortable.
With recent Brazilian business reportedly in the $40s/mt CFR, the current European FOB range seems reflective.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP out of spot as large volumes pre-booked
OCP is understood to still be out of the sulphuric acid spot market, and is likely to remain so for the remainder of February.
Morocco has a large volume scheduled to arrive in Q1, and given the weakness in downstream fertilizer markets and falling sulphur prices, there will be little incentive for OCP to seek additional tonnes on a spot basis. The buyer reportedly has several vessels waiting at ports.
Sources are now waiting to see what OCP’s likely requirement will be for Q2.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Demand lacking as buyers comfortable
Spot prices for sulphuric acid imports into India were assessed unchanged at $20-30/mt CFR, though spot business is scarce.
One source said they have heard business in the $30s/mt CFR, but such levels would likely be difficult to achieve at this stage.
Buyers were pushing for numbers as low as the upper $10s/mt CFR, but were comfortable on stock levels with no strong demand.
Meanwhile, traders said that CIL has actively started discussing contract prices for 2016 for balance quantities, but there was no confirmation.
India: November imports jump 72%
India’s November 2015 imports of sulphuric acid increased 72% year on year to 95,293 mt, with imports for
the first 11 months up 66% at 1.24 million mt.
The vast majority of the November tonnes came from South Korea, while 18,643 mt came from Spain. This marked the first time India has imported sulphuric acid from Spain.
Japan and South Korea were the main sources of Indian acid imports over the year to November, supplying 503,750 mt and 479,667 mt respectively.
Imports from China increased to 119,652 mt from nothing in previous years, while those from the Philippines climbed 15% to 66,791 mt. Imports from North Korea also increased from nothing to 45,590 mt.
Brazil: Prices in $40s/mt CFR limit negativity
Sources suggested that the recent tenders from Yara and Mosaic were awarded in the $40s/mt CFR, though details were not confirmed.
Prices were pegged as high as the mid-to-high $40s/mt CFR, but the upper $40s/mt CFR would suggest increasing prices, which seems unlikely given price movements in broader markets.
The Yara requirement is reportedly being met by tonnes from Peru.
Yara’s tender for 18,000 mt for delivery early March closed January 15, while Mosaic was heard to be
seeking 12,000 mt a week later.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Domestic prices stabilise as stocks cleared
Acid prices in China were relatively stable over the course of the week, as destocking was mostly completed.
Recent production cuts by sulphur burners and pyrite plants have also been supportive.
Many smelters prices are now less than RMB 100/mt EXW and may be negative after March. This is down from RMB 150-300/mt in H1 2015, and it is likely that smelters may be at negative prices within Q1.
Import prices were pegged from the high $10s/mt to the low $20s/mt CFR.
Japan/South Korea: Spot unchanged; falls expected
Spot prices for East Asian exports of sulphuric acid remained assessed at $0-10/mt FOB Japan/South Korea given a lack of new business and indications.
Sources have suggested levels at either end of this price range, though more believed that lower prices were likely, most prevalently minus $5/mt to $5/mt FOB. Indeed, some sources believe that Asian prices will decline further over coming weeks as availability eases. For now though, firm spot indications were scarce.
Japan: Exports inch down 4% for 2015
Japan’s December 2015 exports of sulphuric acid plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.
The Philippines was the largest outlet for 2015 exports, taking 1.26 million mt, though this was 5% less than in 2014.
Exports to India, on the other hand, climbed to 503,372 mt from 379,532 mt.
Volumes to Chile declined to 319,910 mt from 421,635 mt, while exports to China plunged to 26,541 mt from 114,985 mt.
Most of the remaining volumes went to Southeast
Asia, Taiwan and Australia.
The Philippines was as usual the outlet for largest share of Japanese exports in December, taking 109,994 mt.
Other export destinations included India (18,098 mt), Australia (10,499 mt), and Taiwan (6,500 mt), with around 5,000 mt to each of Singapore and Vietnam.
Philippines: No acid exports in October
Exports of sulphuric acid from the Philippines for the first 10 months of the year fell 40% year on year to 131,357 mt, and the country did not export any acid in October.
Indonesia was the main destination, receiving 64,900 mt from January through October.
The remainder has gone to Malaysia, Australia and
India also received product.
The country resumed exports in August and
September, having not exported any acid over the
May-July period.
In recent years, exports from the country have begun to play a larger role in the regional trade dynamic as the PASAR smelter has operated while adjacent consumer Philphos has remained closed since November 2013 following Typhoon Haiyan.
The smelter shut April 16, 2015 for maintenance and work to increase capacity. The sulphuric acid capacity was 500,000 mt/year and work at the site
was intended to double acid production, though a major increase in acid output is not likely to be felt until at least mid-2016.
Although the plant has sold some tonnes since its restart, it has also reportedly had some delays ramping up, and the current and future production of the smelter remains one of the key uncertainties in global acid markets.
The Philippines’ October 2015 imports increased to 95,878 mt, up from only 2,114 mt in October 2014. However, total imports for the first 10 months were still down 13% at 375,205 mt.
Almost all of the imports have come from Japan, although Taiwan was the source of 8,444 mt, the majority of which (6,037 mt) was imported in June 2015.
