ANALYSIS
CF Industries sells large UAN quantity into France
UAN
UAN discussions at this week’s IFA conference were focused how much CF will sell into Europe over the summer months.
At press time CF had sold as much as 100,000 mt UAN-32 into Rouen to Invivo with the first 35,000 mt shipment already fixed. Business was reported concluded at about $180/mt FOB US Gulf ($160/st FOB barge New Orleans equivalent). Given freight estimates of around $35/mt and current euro/dollar exchange rates this would translate to about €194/mt FCA for UAN-30 loading from tanks in France, plus provisions for margins and carrying costs. Smaller forward sales of UAN-30 into France have been concluded at €192/mt FCA.
Little other UAN is reported available with Abu Qir yet to issue another export tender. GrodnoAzot also reportedly scrapped its May 22 tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32.
Despite the CF export business to France and Argentina, US UAN values have not firmed and inland distributors report US producers are responding rapidly to prompt demand for more UAN.
Ammonium sulphate
Demand from Brazil remains one of the few AS market drivers with supplier offers still reported at $160- 170/mt CFR. Recent further declines in corn prices and difficulties getting credit in the country have stalled potential purchases for the time being though. Caprolactam grade product offers are reported at $160- 170/mt CFR while granular AS is nearer $220-230/mt CFR.
TCCC will likely soon issue another AS import tender for 6,000 mt. Current prices for Chinese caprolactam grade product for Thailand are pegged at $150/mt CFR providing netbacks around $130/mt FOB.
Ammonium nitrate/CAN
The May 26 Yara annnouncement of a €50/mt drop in the price for CAN for new season deliveries in Germany to €225/mt CIF highlighted an otherwise slow week in trading in solid nitrates. While so far not announced by Yara, the price for Germany will also apply for deliveries in Benelux.
Exports of AN from the FSU remain limited, but a slight uptick in netbacks was evident over the week despite the concerns on financing in Brazil as highlighted in the above.
Importers in Turkey cite offers for AN at attractive forward prices, and may opt to purchase early rather than wait for the traditional summer lull basis prices indicated by sellers that reflect netbacks to FSU producers substantially below current numbers.
MARKETS
UAN
NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: Market mostly watching with CF exports
Domestic barge trades were thin this week for UAN-32, leaving most of the market to focus on recent CF Industries' export commitments of around 130,000 mt. Traders report that 100,000 mt is committed to France, while the 30,000 mt balance is covering a sale to Argentina. Indications based on enduser values in those markets suggest a net to the producer of about $180/mt FOB US Gulf or roughly the equivalent of $160/st FOB in a barge, allowing for loading costs.
While this is far less than recent spot domestic business around $240/st FOB New Orleans, CF is expected to increasingly participate in the export market to balance its supply against increasing output from other US inland producers, including the OCI plant under construction in Iowa.
US Midwest: UAN demand steady but application delay
The US Midwest region has been wet throughout much of May, but has not suffered through the flooding reported in many states to the south. However, overall movement of all products is down as much as 40% in some areas compared to historical averages for the month. However, none of this is worrisome to distributors as they fully expect to make up sales during June. Even though little UAN has been used in the region, distributors report retailers are ordering more than expected in many areas.
UAN pricing in the remains at $9.22-9.63/unit FOB. UAN demand is benefitting from the recent wet weather, as much of the corn ground remains too soggy for ammonia application equipment. In addition, corn growth has been more rapid than in prior years. This week's US Department of Agriculture survey found 74% of the expected corn crop had emerged nationwide, compared to the five-year average of 62%. As the corn gets taller, ammonia application becomes less attractive and anecdotal evidence suggests farmers and retailers are buying more UAN and urea to ensure proper nitrogen applications in coming weeks for corn in the region.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic: GrodnoAzot scraps latest UAN-32 export tender
GrodnoAzot reportedly scrapped its May 22 tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32. This follows the scrapping of its May 11 session for the same volume.
EUROPE
France: CF sells up to 100,000 mt UAN to Invivo
CF Industries has sold as much as 100,000 mt UAN-32 into Rouen to Invivo with the first 35,000 mt shipment already fixed. The business was reported concluded at about $180/mt FOB US Gulf ($160/st FOB barge New Orleans equivalent). Given freight estimates of around $35/mt and current euro/dollar exchange rates this would translate to about €194/mt FCA for UAN-30 loading from tanks in France, plus provisions for margins and carrying costs.
Small forward sales of UAN-30 into France have been concluded at €192/mt FCA with some sellers still holding back from concluding business in anticipation of selling at even higher prices in the coming month.
Netherlands: Prompt UAN business continues
Prompt sales of UAN continue to be made into the Netherlands with prices reported at an even €215/mt FCA.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Next Abu Qir UAN-32 tender likely for June
Abu Qir has not yet issued another export tender. The supplier is thought to be waiting until sufficient tonnes are accumulated and for export licenses covering the month of June.
AS
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: AS business slow due to credit difficulties
Brazilian demand for AS is steadily increasing although recent further declines in corn prices and difficulties getting credit in the country have stalled potential purchases for the time being.
Latest production estimates for the country's corn crop continue to rise due to favourable weather, adding further to corn inventories and lower prices. With the cost of inputs continuing to rise and domestic corn prices hitting six months lows (according to the IGC), the next season's planted area is likely to decline possibly impacting future AS consumption. Concerns over Brazilian farmers' access to credit at preferential interest-rates was also a common theme at the annual IFA conference held in Istanbul this week.
Caprolactam grade product offers are reported at $160-170/mt CFR while granular AS is nearer $220-230/mt CFR.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Thailand: TCCC may issue another AS tender soon
TCCC will likely soon issue another AS import tender for 6,000 mt. Current prices for Chinese caprolactam grade product for Thailand are pegged at $150/mt CFR.
AN
EUROPE
Turkey: Marketers indicate forward availability of AN
Marketers of ammonium nitrate have been approaching Turkish importers this week with indications of availablility as far forward as November and December at prices around $230/mt CFR with 180 days credit, duty paid.
Buyers have been counter-indicating some $15/mt lower, but purchasing interest in the positions is evident. The $222.50/mt CFR average of the bids and offers would suggest a $209/mt CFR value for dutiable Russian or Ukranian tonnage, inclusive of credit, for a 205/mt CFR cash equivalent or about $185-190/mt FOB from the Black Sea, depending on cargo size and discharge port.
CAN
EUROPE
Germany: Yara posts new season CAN price
Yara notified its clients May 26 that the price for CAN in Germany effective June 1 onwards has been fixed at €225/mt CIF inland ports. The posting was down by €50/mt on the previous season price posted at €275/mt CIF, and was also down by €3/mt on the €228/mt CIF price published June 10, 2014, applicable for deliveries from mid-July 2014.
