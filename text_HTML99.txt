ANALYSIS
Chinese strategy to support prilled prices pays off
The Chinese strategy to hold off on sales of prilled urea below $290/mt FOB is still working, and has provided producers with improving returns again this week. Sales are reported above the $300/mt FOB marker for prills to cover traders short on sales in India via the IPL tender and to Pakistan in the recent TCP sessions. Prilled values are now rapidly approaching those for granular urea.
Unlike prills, traders were generally cautious to short Chinese product in recent weeks, and attempts by sellers to secure traditional premiums for regular Chinese granular have not been successful. Superior Chinese product such as the China Blue granular does however still trade at premiums above $10/mt on prills.
A softer sentiment is definitely apparent for granular urea in the region, evidenced not only by limited buying interest in China, but also via low bids for the 60,000 mt premium quality product from Kaltim in Indonesia this week.
A shift in concentration from prilled to granular urea will obviously occur if regional values of the two grades should closely match, as enduser markets favour Chinese granular over Chinese prills.
The overall market for granular urea nevertheless depends increasingly on sustained values in the US barge market, but these were also southbound for forward positions this week.
Finding the trend for granular urea barges in the US has been problematc all year, as traders continually sold forward tons substantially lower than the prompt market. This pattern was repeated this week, as spot granular urea barges changed hands in the $330s-$340s/st FOB New Orleans while 1H July barges sold around $305/st FOB. This pattern has made the US less attractive than other markets for granular urea, which ultimately has led to thin supplies on a prompt basis for the last couple of months.
In Europe, buyers remain cautious and the majority of importers of granular product are yet to get on the band-wagon for significant quantities for August and beyond. Some buyers have nevertheless opted to hedge the forward market by purchasing parts of envisaged requirements close to current values. These decisions were undoubtedly influence by erratic output in North Africa in recent weeks.
Brazilian importers that were off for a holiday June 4 continued to play a waiting-game this week, evidently feeling convinced that a buyer's market will return in July. Procurement anywhere close to the offers in the high $330s/mt CFR currently on the table is not regarded an advisable move by the importers, despite repeat reports of Middle East cargos originally intended for Brazil being diverted to the US and Australia.
Prilled values were not only gaining in China. Limited availability out of the Black Sea following Group DF's decision to suspend urea output from Cherkassy triggered a 25,000 mt purchase by NF Trading to load in June to cover quantity-commitments via NF Italia, mainly to industrial clients. The $298/mt FOB Yuzhnyy price suggested in the deal did raise some eyebrows in the trade, as offers for smaller quantities from Yuzhnyy were available to load in June some $5/mt lower.
On the demand side, planting in the US slowed this week, with corn approaching completion. The US set 2015 blending volumes at 13.4 billion gallons, below market expectations and well below the 15
billion gallons that were legislated.
The Brazilian government has finally released the details of the 2015/16 Harvest Plan. President Dilma Rousseff announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the support programme, to BRL 187.7 billion ($59.8 billion), termed a 'generous surprise' by the Agriculture Minister Katia Abreu. While the overall level of support is deemed generous, it may not be entirely supportive for domestic fertilizer purchasing.
Farmers rely heavily on subsidised interest rates in production loans to purchase fertilizers. Funding allocation for these loans has been upped 7.5% y-o-y, to BRL 94.5 billion ($30.12 billion). For medium sized producers, production loan interest rates have been set at 7.75% per annum (p.a.), while larger producers who take a bulk of the funding will see rates of 8.75% p.a. These rates are close to market expectations. Last year interest rates were 6.5% p.a. Most of the funding increase has gone towards loans that will be available at market interest rates that are around 17-23% p.a.
While the 20% funding increase may seem favourable on the surface, it is unlikely to provide any significant support to fertilizer purchases. Brazilian delegates at the recent IFA conference voiced concerns over the availability of credit.
The Indian Meteorological Department continues to be downbeat on its monsoon forecast, this week lowering likely rainfall levels to 88% of normal (93% last week). Indications are for 66% chance of a 'deficient' monsoon and only a 6% chance of a 'normal' season.
Highlights of the week
∙Offers to TCP in Pakistan plentiful, but at high prices compared to India`
∙Kaltim fails to achieve targets in June 3 sales tender for 60,000 mt granular
∙US granular settles into more modest price-range
∙Chinese prilled values surge close to granular on trader shorts
∙New Indian urea tender yet to be announced but is suggested imminent
∙Pakistan's ECC clears more imports, but tenders yet to be floated
∙Brazilian importers reject high offers as news on increased credits emerge
∙Algerian exports continue and output to normalize shortly
Short term outlook
Mixed. Market perception remains for significant oversupply in Q3 and into Q4, but cuts in output and pockets of regional shortages could well support current values into July. Forward length point to significant downward adjustments in prices, but the timing of the corrections is still open for debate.
Continued price-strength beyond July 15 does however appear questionable and traders are already evaluating timing for possible short positions. Once and when over the "edge", urea values will undoubtedly suffer from lack of market liquidity, suggesting that downward corrections may be quite substantial.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
US Southern Plains: Conditions still drying out
Retailers are adding to their urea positions but relatively little product has moved to the ground this week, mostly due to the soggy conditions. Once corn acres are more supportive for application equipment, a surge in demand is expected that distributors will find difficult to meet.
New tows have not been able to start up the flooded Arkansas River for a week and another week of at least slow movement is anticipated. As a result, truck values generally remain around $390/st FOB in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
US: April plunge in arrivals aided recent price strength
Even though the plunge in US urea imports during April was expected, much of the marketplace did not forecast quite such a decline as was reported this week by the US Department of Commerce. April arrivals fell to 695,753 st (631,183 mt) from 1.06 million st (963,427 mt) one year earlier. Apparent denial on the part of many traders about the April volumes likely fueled the strong prices seen in May's barge market.
Most of the decline in arrivals was spread relatively evenly across traditional suppliers to the US. Somewhat surprisingly the decline in shipments from Caribbean suppliers Venezuela and Trinidad was the most stark, with just 4,439 st arriving in April 2015 versus 151,704 st in April 2014. The largest suppliers to the US duiring April of this yea included Qatar at 170,685 st, UAE at 145,916 st and Canada at 127,139 st.
For the first 10 months of the US fertilizer year through April, US urea imports were 7.23 million st (6.56 million mt) versus 6.61 million st (6 million mt) for the prior year period. Key subscribers for July-April of this year included Qatar at 1.42 million st, China at 1.37 million st and Canada at 798,691 st. While the year- over-year totals still show a significant surge in US imports this year, the April shortfall and long-held anecdotal views that the US needed to make up for a severely depleted supply chain at the start of the fertilizer year suggest that US supplies are relatively snug given typical spring demand.
Canada: Urea imports and exports on the rise
Canadian exports of urea in April were up by 88.5% and January-April exports were lifted by 14.7%. January-April imports were up by 36%.
April exports of 142,000 mt were destined almost exclusively to the US, as was the January-April volume of 401,000 mt.
April imports of 104,000 mt were up by 10.2% on April 2014. The US accounted for 42,000 mt, down by 8.7%, while deliveries from Russia of 28,500 mt were up by 59%.
January-April imports of 281,000 mt were up by 36% on 2014, but arrivals from the US of 98,000 mt were off by 6.9%. Germany accounted for 34,000 mt, up by 53% while arrivals of 32,000 mt from Bahrain lifted imports from that nation from zero in the prior year. Russia accounted for 31,000 mt, Qatar for 21,000 mt, UAE for 19,000 mt and Kuwait for 17,000 mt.
US NOLA: Trades and prices pick up
The high end of the granular urea barge market started the week and generally held at $345-348/st FOB, but prompt barges also traded as low as $335/st FOB. Offers for 2H June barges were as high as $340/st FOB, but most trades occured at $316-320/st FOB. Forward business for 1H July is substantially discounted at $305/st FOB.
Meanwhile, full tows will not be able to move up the Arkansas River to Tulsa Oklahoma for as long as two weeks while flood waters ease.
There are reports that EuroChem's June cargo that was due in the Gulf June 11 now will not reach the Southwest Pass to the Mississippi River until June 16. A Koch cargo out of Oman previously expected in the first half of this month now appears likely to discharge at the end of the month. Finally, traders report CF Industries temporarily stopped making new truck sales out of Donaldsonville Louisiana plant this week in order to catch up on its barge commitments, but the company has not posted any news relating to the rumor.
Mexico: Interest in prilled and granular urea
Mexican importers indicate interest in additional volumes of granular urea for the West Coast (WCM) and there is also open interest in prills for the East Coast (ECM).
Indications from buyers for WCM granular are around $325/mt CFR, but importers appear in no hurry to cover, citing prospects of further price-concessions in coming weeks. Offers are well above $330/mt CFR despite the slight weakening in recent netbacks to Chinese producers.
Importers of prills for ECM are yet to concede demands from sellers of prills from the FSU based on FOB values from the Baltic and the Black Sea in the upper $290s/mt FOB and are aiming some $15/mt below indications around the $320/mt CFR marker.
Mexican imports of urea in March were up by a full 125% to 120,000 mt. Chinese product accounted for 58,000 mt, up from zero in March 2014. Deliveries from Russia of 49,000 mt were up by 5% to 49,000 mt.
Q1 imports of 215,500 mt were nevertheless only up by 8% on the prior year, but imports from China registered an increase of 254% to reach 119,000 mt. Arrivals from Russia were down by 34.4% to 82,000 mt and shipments from Qatar were down to zero from 33,000 mt in Q1 2014.
US Midwest/N Plains: Retailers travel farther for urea
Granular urea is in tight supply from the Dakotas to Illinois, although pricing has only moved modestly higher in recent days. Buyers in the Dakotas have been willing to shop for truckloads from Missouri and Iowa rather than risk delays possible when ordering by rail. As a result business in the last few days in the Dakotas has occured up to $400/st DEL this week, up $5/st from last week's high. On the other hand warehouse pricing in Iowa and Minnesota continues at $370-375/st FOB.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Peru: Urea imports through Q1 up significantly
Peruvian imports of urea identified by customs via GTIS in the first quarter of 2015 of 119,000 mt were up by 86.6% following a massive increase of 262% to 63,600 mt in the month of March. Deliveries in March from China of 43,400 mt were up from zero in March 2014 while Russian arrivals of 20,200 mt were up by 15%.
China also dominated Q1 imports with deliveries of 70,200 mt, up from zero in Q1 2014. Arrivals from Russia were however down by 26% in the quarter, to 48,200 mt.
Colombia: Imports of urea down significantly in Q1
Imports of urea by Colombia as identified by customs via GTIS in March were down by 22.6% on March 2014 to 24,400 mt. This brought the Q1 total to 71,000 mt, down by 35.4% on the prior year.
The imports in March and in the first quarter of the year were about equally split between supplies from China and Venezuela.
Renewed interest in imports of granular urea emerged this week for a cargo in combination with a requirement in El Salvador. Indications from sellers for Chinese product in the upper $330s/mt CFR for two ports on the west coast did not elicit significant buying interest.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Ukraine: Urea exports continue to trail prior years
Exports of urea from Ukraine continue to suffer from cutbacks in output from Group DF units and the overall instability in the country. March exports identified by customs via GTIS of 168,600 mt were down by 16% on March 2014, and Q1 exports of 436,000 mt were down by 13.9%.
March shipments of 85,000 mt to Turkey were down by 24%, but the 25,000 mt loaded for Spain was up from zero in March 2014. Shipments to Italy of 17,600 mt were off by 51%.
Turkey accounted fror 209,000 mt out of the Q1 volume, up by 9.5% on Q1 2014. Shipments to Spain were up from 6,600 mt to 59,000 mt while deliveries to Italy were down by 25.3% to 58,000 mt.
Black Sea: Prilled price up on NF purchase
Trading in prilled urea remains limited out of the Black Sea, mainly on limited availability following the closure of the Group DF plants, as reported last week. The cut in Cherkassy output triggered a purchase by NF Trading this week from a trader at a suggested $298/mt FOB Yuzhnyy for 25,000 mt to load for Italy mid- June to cover prior commitments via NF Italia originally planned to load from own production.
The price indicated is viewed with some scepticism in the trade, given offers in the beginning of the week some $4-5/mt lower.
Shipments from Yuzhnyy/TIS in May worked out marginally above 146,000 mt and the lineup for June is so far limited to about 14,000 mt loading on the Abdullatif (11,000 mt for Keytrade) and the C. Pioneer (3,300 mt for Wittraco).
EUROPE
France: Some more forward interest for July, August
Suppliers of granular urea to France for forward positions suggest that trades for July and August delivery have been concluded in the low €320s/mt FCA this week. Buyers still contend that cover for August can be obtained below €300/mt FCA.
The prompt market is void of activity, and is therefore assessed at par with last week around the €325/mt FCA marker. This implies a delivered value around $350/mt CFR into the French Bay given the stronger euro in recent days, suggesting netbacks to Egyptian producers below $315/mt FOB for an intermediary to generate a margin. Sales of July posititions would provide producers with returns around $310/mt FOB if loaded from Egypt.
Turkey: Q1 2015 imports below 2014
Turkish importers of urea for direct application are largely holding off on purchases due to the higher values perceived for Black Sea material following the closure of Group DF output of urea. Open interest is essentially limited to industrial users such as Kastamonu that tenders June 4 for 3,500 mt for June delivery.
Turkish imports of urea in Q1 2015 as identified by customs via GTIS of 356,000 mt were meanwile off by 5.5% on the first quarter of 2014. This despite March imports of 152,000 mt that were up by 9% on the prior year.
March imports from Ukraine of 81,000 mt were up by 23% on March 2014 and deliveries from Iran of 40,500 mt were up by 266%. Arrivals from Russia were down by 66% to 15,000 mt and China accounted for 12,000 mt.
Q1 arrivals from Ukraine of 175,000 mt were up by 19% and deliveries from Iran of 105,000 mt were up by a full 471%. China accounted for 34,300 mt, up from 1,600 in Q1 in 2014. Shipments of 15,000 mt from Russia were down by 89.6% and arrivals from Romania of 9,500 mt were down by 68% compared to Q1 2014.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Offers available despite cuts
Traders suggest that indications of availability of granular urea around the $320/mt FOB marker are available from Egyptian producers despite continuing cuts in output due to erratic supply of natural gas.
Limited prompt trades in granular urea are reported in key European outlets, but indications of interest in forward positions in France and Mediterranean markets would provide sellers with returns around $310- 315/mt FOB for cargoes loading in June when allowing for storage plus financing costs.
Algeria: Sorfert to restore urea output shortly
Algerian producer Sorfert indicated it expects its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up to commercial output shortly. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.
The producer completed loading of 15 vessels in May for contract-holders Helm, Indagro, Keytrade, OCI, Trammo and Ameropa for a total close to 100,000 mt despite the outage and the force majeure declaration that ensued. Indagro was in the freight market this week for a vessel to load 25,000 mt for the US Gulf in June 6-8 laydays from Arzew.
Operations at the first 1.3 million mt/year AOA granular urea line are reported regular with additional nominations made for carriers to load for Europe and Brazil.
Middle East: Producers still bullish on limited supply
Middle East producers cite limited availability for the next 30-45 days in support of quotes for sales outside contract commitments around $315/mt FOB despite lower bids from traders.
Returns on open business in key spot markets such as Brazil are yet to exceed $305/mt FOB, and Brazilian buyers appear in no hurry to secure additional tonnage given inbound carriers with unsold quantities on board.
Despite the rebound in US spot prices this week, forward barge values at New Orleans that would apply for vessels arriving in about two weeks around an even $320/st FOB are indicative of delivered values of $346/mt CFR, suggesting producer netbacks after deduction of freight and transaction charges marginally above $320/mt FOB. End-June/early July trades around $305/st FOB New Orleans reflect returns at $305/mt FOB Middle East.
Firm offers in paper markets for full July positions from the Middle East were posted June 4 at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $295/mt FOB against bids at $285/mt FOB.
Egypt: Natural gas shortages reflected in exports
Shortages of natural gas continue to impact urea exports from Egypt identitified by customs via GTIS, with the Q1 2015 volume down by a full 80% on 2014 to 154,000 mt. March exports of 37,500 mt were down by
84% with deliveries to France cut by 80% to 34,000 mt. Shipments to Greece of 2,600 mt were down by 88%.
Q1 shipments to France of 93,500 were off by 79.2% while cargoes loaded from Italy totaling 19,500 mt were down by 86%, and shipments to Greece dropped by 62.3% to 19,000 mt. Deliveries to Spain were down from 64,000 mt to 2,000 mt.
South Africa: Urea imports through April down on 2014
South African imports of urea identified by customs via GTIS from January through April of 99,300 mt were down by 36.1% on the same period in 2014.
Qatar accounted for 61,600 mt, down by 13.7% on the prior year while deliveries from Saudi Arabia of 28,000 mt were off by 58%. Shipments from the UAE of 7,200 mt were up from zero in the same period in 2014.
April imports of 25,000 mt were mainly sourced from Qatar, and were down by 49.3% on on April 2014.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: GTIS identifies March imports at 729,000 mt
Indian imports of urea in March as identified by customs via GTIS of 729,000 mt were up by 248% on March 2014. This lifted Q1 imports to 2.34 million mt, up by 144% on Q1 2014.
March imports from China of 438,000 mt were up sharply on the 38,000 mt imported in March 2014 and imports from OMIFCO in Oman of 314,000 mt were up by 33% on the prior year. Imports from Iran in March 2015 of 75,000 mt were up from zero in March 2014.
China accounted for 1.72 million mt of the 2.34 million imported in Q1, up by 335% on the prior year. Deliveries from Oman were up by 5.25% to 522,000 mt and shipments from Iran totaled 75,000 mt. Provisional data from the Fertilizer Association of India for April imports as posted in the May 20 update suggested a 872,000 mt volume.
A May 27 statement issued by the Indian Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers contended that supply of urea for Kharif is "adequate and comfortable", citing an increase in imports of 1 million mt and a similar increase in domestic output. A follow-up tender to secure cover to complement the relatively limited tonnage prodcured via the April 10 STC tender and the May 9 IPL session is nevertheless expected early June to make up for the estimated shortfall in availability for Kharif.
Pakistan: TCP awards Dreymoor and Samsung
Pakistani importer TCP has issued Letters of Intent to Dreymoor and Samsung at the prices offered by the traders in the May 29 and June 1 tenders, respectively.
Dreymoor was awarded the 50,000 mt in the May 29 session at $318.63/mt CFR while Samsung took the 50,000 mt in the June 1 tender at $318.53/mt CFR.
TCP has yet to receive final instructions to proceed with tenders to cover the 150,000 mt urea approved by the ECC for import pursuant to the awards made in the above tenders, but is expected to float three sessions for 50,000 mt each at the end of June/early July.
Pakistan: June 1 TCP tender attracts 13 offers
The June 1 TCP tender for 50,000 mt prilled or granular urea for prompt shipment attracted offers from 13 suppliers, each offering the full tonnage.
Samsung reduced its $319.92/mt CFR price in the May 29 session to $318.53/mt CFR and was the lowest in the June 1 tender. Dreymoor was second June 1 at $318.54/mt CFR, followed by Liven at $325.38/mt CFR and by Ameropa at $327.43/mt CFR. Transglobe was at $329.21/mt CFR, Swiss at $329.43/mt CFR, Indagro at $329.74/mt CFR, and Quantum at $329.75/mt CFR. Keytrade, Daewoo, Fertisul, CHS and Trammo were all above $330/mt CFR.
The Samsung offer was down by a mere $0.10/mt on the winning Dreymoor offer in the May 29 tender.
Pakistan: May 29 TCP tender attracts eight offers
The May 29 TCP tender for 50,000 mt prilled or granular urea for prompt shipment attracted offers from eight suppliers, each offering the full tonnage.
Dreymoor submitted the lowest offer at $318.63/mt CFR, followed by Samsung at $319.92/mt CFR and by Keytrade at $332.50/mt CFR. Ameropa was at $332.76/mt CFR, Quantum at $332.90/mt CFR, Liven at $334.38/mt CFR, Transglobe at $334.50/mt CFR and CHS at $338.37/mt CFR.
The Dreymoor offer reflected a netback to the trader marginally below $300/mt FOB from China basis freight for a large carrier on TCP terms estimated at $15-17/mt and transaction costs including L/C confirmation charges around $3/mt.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Malaysia: Mixed signals in exports through February
Malaysian February urea exports identified by customs via GTIS of 100,000 mt were off by about 12% on February 2014, but the January- February volume of 187,000 mt was up by 9% on the first two months of 2014.
February exports to the Philippines were up by 114% to 39,500 mt while deliveries to the US of 30,000 mt were off by about 50% on the prior year.
The Philippines accounted for 92,000 mt of the 187,000 mt shipped in January-February, up by 196%, while
Australia went from zero to 33,000 mtin the two months. Shipments to the US
were off by 50% per the above while deliveries to Thailand of 15,000 mt were down by 68% on the prior year.
Thailand: Urea imports up in April, Saudis supply bulk
Trade in granular urea in Thailand remains subdued due to the wide spread in price ideas tabled by sellers and buyers. Quotes in the mid- $330s/mt CFR are countered around an even $320/mt CFR, at best, and importers appear content to wait for price-concessions from suppliers.
A trader is in the freight market for a vessel to load 25,000 mt granular urea from Tianjin or Jinzhou in China to Bangkok/Kohsichang in June 10-20 laydays.
Imports of urea by Thailand in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 207,400 mt were meanwhile up by 3.2% on April 2015. Saudi Arabia accounted for 103,000 mt, Qatar for 44,000 mt, Malaysia 31,000 mt and Oman for 22,000 mt.
January-April imports of 551,000 mt were nevertheless off by about 14.6% on the first four months of 2014. Saudi Arabia remained the number one supplier with 251,000 mt, but that volume was down by 14.6% on the prior year. Arrivals from Malaysia were up marginally to 97,000 mt while deliveries from Qatar of 89,000 mt were off by 19.6%. Shipments from Indonesia of 30,000 mt were up by 20% on the prior year.
China: Offers for prilled urea up further for export
Domestic values for prilled and granular urea in China were largely in line with last week, but quotes for prills for export were up. Offers for prills for prompt export are at $305-308/mt FOB while quotes for regular Chinese quality granular were maintained marginally above the $310/mt FOB marker.
Mainstream domestic trades in prilled urea at RMB 1,680/mt ($271/mt) EXW in northern China were at par with last week. Trades were recorded in Shanxi at RMB 1,620/mt ($261/mt) FCA.
Domestic buyers are still competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export as high as RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $307/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporters.
Domestic values for granular urea for export were relatively flat at RMB 1,780-1,800/mt CPT northern ports, with the high end indicative of an export price at $315/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. A 7,000 mt sale to Namhae in South Korea this week is however reported at a netback to the seller assessed around
$308/mt FOB. China Blue meanwhile indicated returns marginally above $315/mt FOB for its premium quality product.
The softer tendency in regional export values for granular urea was also evident in the June 3 tender in Indonesia that attracted bids no higher than $302/mt FOB Bontang against the reserve set by Pupuk Kaltim at $325/mt FOB for the premium-quality grade. Kaltim has since adjusted its reserve to $313/mt FOB and is in discussions with traders.
Inventories in Chinese ports for export have increased on last week, but not substantially. Yantai inventory is assessed at 270,000 mt this week compared to 220,000 mt last week. The inventory consists of about 180,000 mt granular urea and 90,000 mt prills. Arrivals into the port have however slowed to about 5,000 mt/day from about 10,000 mt/day last week. Qingdao inventory is assessed at a mere 25,000 mt.
Indonesia: Kaltim scraps sales tender
Pupuk Kaltim elected to scrap the June 3 tender for the sale of 60,000 mt granular urea for June lifting from Bontang. The producer had set the reserve (minimum) price for the tonnage at $325/mt FOB, but failed to attract bids close to that number.
The highest bid received was from CHS at $302/mt FOB, with FertComm second at $300/mt FOB. These were down on the single bid at $305/mt FOB received by Kaltim in the May 22 tender for the sale of 30,000 mt that was also scrapped.
The producer has since adjusted its reserve down to $313/mt FOB and is in discussions with traders. Production of ammonia at Kaltim V is meanwhile close to rated capacity and urea is running around 80% of capacity.

While all reasonable efforts are taken to ensure the reliability of the fertilizer pricing and freight pricing data, FW does not guarantee its accuracy or take liability for the results obtained by using the data.
Using FW prices in contracts: Many subscribers to Fertilizer Week use Fertilizer Week benchmark prices in their contracts. When both sides in a business arrangement agree in advance to use a set of prices it creates more certainty and saves everyone time – as long as the prices can be relied upon. Fertilizer Week publishes a regularly updated methodology document with detailed definitions of every price we publish. By understanding how we calculate our prices, you will be able to build your own scenarios based on these prices
