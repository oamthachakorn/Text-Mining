ANALYSIS
Sales prices climb but market participants cautious
Further signs of slight price increases were evident in sulphur markets this week, particularly on Middle Eastern FOB levels, but market participants including sellers are cautious about prices rising too quickly and leading to a subsequent slump.
Adnoc increased its OSP by $5/mt to $145/mt FOB for June, following Tasweeq’s $2/mt increase of its QSP to $141/mt FOB.
In addition, recent spot sales out of the Middle East have been reported from the low $140s/mt FOB to the high $140s/mt FOB, and KPC’s most recent 30,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded at $146/mt FOB this week, up from the low $140s/mt FOB of its 20,000 mt tender last week. Availability is understood to be tight, and sellers report enquiries for both spot volumes and contractual top-ups.
Market participants are waiting for Aramco to finalise its July price on June 10. An increase is expected, though the scale of the increase has yet to be determined.
In addition, Middle Eastern sellers are hoping to finalise all Q3 contract talks next week in advance of Ramadan, and these talks will also provide indications of the market direction.
Domestic Chinese prices also climbed, as domestic availability was relatively tight. Sources also suggested that buyers in China were demonstrating a greater willingness to accept import prices in the high $150s/mt CFR than last week.
However, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphates demand, as monsoon delays and the weak rupee add further impetus for declines in Chinese phosphate export prices, and this may make Chinese phosphate producers more cautious about buying sulphur. Indian sulphur price ideas were also heard lower on the week, and the country's Q1 imports were down 3.8% despite March imports climbing 28.2% from a year earlier.
OCP remains out of the sulphur spot market at present as it is content with term contracts. The country’s Q1 imports climbed 8.8% on the year.
Elsewhere, the US imported another 27,500 mt of sulphur form Kazakhstan in April, further demonstrating that US sulphur buyers are implementing their previously-stated strategy to bring in solid sulphur from overseas and re-melt in the US Gulf.
Meanwhile, Fertilizer Week published its June short-term forecast, which suggests a similar trend to the previous month’s iteration, although forecast levels are lower overall given a greater than anticipated decline in May prices.
Highlights of the week:
∙Adnoc increases OSP to $145/mt FOB for June
∙KPC's latest 30,000 mt tender goes at $146/mt FOB
∙Middle East spot reported in mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB
∙Chinese domestic prices climb further
∙Market concerned over Indian phosphate outlook
∙Moroccan Q1 imports up 8.8%
∙US brings in further Kazakh sulphur in April
∙Fertilizer Week published latest short term forecast

US: Further solid sulphur brought in from Kazakhstan
The US imported another sulphur cargo from Kazakhstan in April, bringing in 27,500 mt from the FSU country. This further demonstrates that US sulphur buyers are implementing their previously-stated strategy to bring in solid sulphur from overseas and re-melt in the US Gulf.
Mosaic’s 1 million mt/year sulphur melter at its New Wales Florida phosphate complex, planned as a way to benefit from global sulphur availability, is expected to start in Q4 2015. It will reduce the buyer’s dependency on North American suppliers of molten sulphur. In the meantime, Mosaic is expected to take advantage of
existing sulphur melting facilities at Galveston, Texas, to enable it to bring in formed sulphur from overseas. After melting at Galveston, the company would use its molten carrier to transport product to Tampa.
The ability to use sulphur from a wider range of sources should give buyers more negotiating power and reduce risks around availability.
In 2014, the US imported 25,000 mt from Kazakhstan in July and 27,500 mt in September. Prior to this it had not imported Kazakh sulphur.
US: Q1 sulphur production down 2.3%
US sulphur production for March 2015 was 724,000 mt, down 4.5% year on year and up 8.4% from the previous month, according to the US Geological Survey.
This brought total production for the first quarter to 2.12 million mt, down 2.3% year on year.
March shipments were down 4.3% on the year at 728,000 mt, while Q1 shipments were down 3.2% at 2.14 million mt.
US stockpiles in March were 137,000 mt.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Contractual loading running smoothly
Sellers of Russian product report that they are currently distributing contractual volumes to buyers and everything is running smoothly.
A large proportion of Russian deliveries is aimed at Morocco.
Q2 contract talks for Russian supply are unlikely to commence until late June.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Jordan: JPMC closes 50,000 mt tender
JPMC closed a tender June 2 for 50,000 mt sulphur for July 15-20 arrival, but no conclusion was yet disclosed.
The buyer's last tender for 50,000 mt, which closed on May 7, was awarded at around $155/mt CFR.
Middle East: Spot prices firm on lack of availability
Recent spot business from the Middle East has been reported as high as $148/mt FOB, although there have also been spot sales this week in the low $140s/mt FOB.
Sellers report steady spot enquiries and enquiries for top-ups on term contracts, but say they have little to no availability for June.
One seller noted that the majority of bid levels had risen from the mid-$130s/mt FOB last week to the low-to- mid-$140s/mt FOB this week.
Market participants awaited confirmation of Saudi Aramco July price, which is expected to be finalised June 10. The seller is likely to increase the price from its June level of $142/mt FOB Jubail.
In addition, Middle Eastern sellers plan to conduct Q3 contract talks next week, as producers want to settle agreements before Ramadan begins June 18.
Kuwait: KPC 30,000 mt tender at $146/mt FOB
KPC’s tender for 20,000 mt sulphur that closed on May 26 was reportedly awarded in the low $140s/mt FOB.
The seller is understood to have subsequently sold another 30,000 mt cargo this week that closed June 2 at $146/mt FOB.
Morocco: Q1 sulphur imports increase 9%
Morocco’s imports of sulphur for Q1 increased 8.8% year on year to 1.08 million mt.
Russia and the UAE were the main suppliers in Q1, as the source of 341,810 mt and 314,997 mt respectively.
Other key sources were the US (114,611 mt), Poland (98,008 mt), Spain (68,334 mt) and Kuwait (62,996 mt).
Morocco: OCP sticking to contracts for now
The Moroccan spot sulphur market has remained quiet in recent weeks, with OCP suggesting that it is focusing on term contracts and waiting for lower prices.
Meanwhile, Q2 contracts for North African granular business are assessed at $145-152/mt CFR based on feedback from buyers and sellers. Although buyer sources had suggested prices as low as $131.50/mt CFR, this level is not considered representative of mainstream business.
UAE: Adnoc posts $145/mt FOB June OSP
Adnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $145/mt FOB Ruwais for June, up $5/mt from its May level.
This represents a delivered price to India in the high $150s/mt CFR.
The price is roughly in line with market expectations, and further indicates that prices have stabilised and show some potential for increasing.
It follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for June at $141/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $2/mt from its April level.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Price ideas lower despite increases elsewhere
IFFCO reportedly bought two cargoes from Japanese suppliers at $154/mt CFR and 158/mt CFR respectively, though it was not confirmed whether this was contractual business.
This is below where prices have been pegged recently and below FACT’s tender purchase two weeks ago in the mid-$160s/mt CFR, and Indian buyers have expressed lower price ideas this week.
If the purchases were on a spot basis, the price level is surprising given that global prices have firmed in recent weeks.
RCF has not yet decided on an award for its 10,000 mt tender that closed May 15. Offers were INR 9,093/mt EXW from Reliance, INR 10,515/mt EXW from Essar, INR 8,485/mt EXW from MRPL, and $170/mt CFR from Swiss Singapore.
India: March sulphur imports climb 28% year on year
India’s March imports of sulphur increased 28.2% year on year to 145,734 mt, leaving Q1 imports down 3.8% at 382,483 mt.
Most of the tonnes came from the Middle East, with 65,933 mt from Saudi Arabia, 31,500 mt from Qatar, 27,410 mt from Kuwait, and 6,210 mt from Bahrain.
In addition, Japan supplied 12,015 mt and
Turmenistan supplied 1,693 mt.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also the largest suppliers for the quarter overall, at 170,287 mt and 103,430 mt respectively.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Prices firming but concerns overs phosphates
Domestic sulphur prices in China increased further this week, rising around RMB 20/mt.
Prices at ports were in the RMB 1,200-1,240/mt FCA range, with the upper end of this representing offer levels at Fangcheng.
One key driver for increases was lower production levels from Sinopec’s Puguang refinery. The producer again increased its own prices, with its price at Wenzhou port now RMB 1,190/mt FCA and its ex-factory price at RMB 1,170/mt FCA. In addition to lowering its production, Pugaung has successfully lowered its stock levels over recent weeks, leaving domestic supply tighter.
Another driver of price increases was the higher FOB prices posted by Middle Eastern sellers and tight international availability of spot product, although this has not yet had a large effect on Chinese CFR prices.
Many Chinese traders had expected price declines, and so don’t currently have much stock. Although they may be willing to accept as high as $157-158/mt CFR, they would resist anything higher, as even this level leaves little margin on sales.
However, sources reported an increased willingness on the part of buyers to accept levels in the high
$150s/mt CFR that were still being resisted last week. One export seller even suggested that they had been told Chinese phosphate producers would be willing to pay $165/mt CFR.
On the other hand, although Chinese phosphate production is relatively stable, there are concerns over export prices. Indian demand for phosphate imports is being damaged by delays in the monsoon as well as weakness in the rupee, and this is adding pressure on Chinese phosphate export prices to decrease. Phosphate producers are therefore somewhat cautious in buying sulphur.
Little change was reported in crushed lump or molten sulphur.
Inventories climbed to around 980,000 mt, and are expected to reach over 1 million mt within the coming week.
Some traders expect prices to reach RMB 1,250/mt FCA soon, but others believe that this view is overly optimistic.
Japan: April sulphur exports climb 3.5%
Japan’s April exports of sulphur increased 3.5% year on year to 89,357 mt, though exports for the first four months of the year were still down 6.4% at 400,726 mt.
The vast majority of the tonnes, 61,756 mt, went to China.
Other destinations included India (11,997 mt), Indonesia (11,498 mt), and South Korea (2,717 mt).
