ANALYSIS
Global: Middle East a potential winner in India
A further slide in global urea prices evident over this week has increased the interest in the outcome of the April 10 STC tender substantially. Producers, traders and financial institutions are all watching the session intently seeking guidance on prompt and forward values, and some possibly distinct changes in trade-flows compared to recent years.
As indicated in last week's issue, competiton for the open business will undoubtedly be fierce, but volumes at the prices being targeted by the Indian importer as low as the $250s/mt CFR may not be readily available.
Middle East producers currently faced with netbacks around an even $240s/mt FOB in Brazilian business might opt to place significant volumes at similar returns in India, and competition from Iran is also expected for at least 350,000 mt to load by the May 27 STC deadline. Middle East participation outside supplies from Iran for significant volumes is however no certainty, but offers, direct and indirect, are expected from at least three of the producers
Chinese producers are still maintaining offers well above the numbers perceived necessary to secure business in India, but traders may opt to short the business aggressively based on perceived prospects to secure cover permitting margins after the STC session closes.
Following declines reported last week, aggressive quotes in Brazil by traders needing to dispose of contract tonnage from the Middle East triggered confirmed sales around $260/mt CFR this week and buyers have since lowered bids into the $250s/mt CFR.
In the Black Sea, the market has been relatively stable, and the combination of traders covering prior short sales and prospects of 150,000 mt to be shipped to Egypt by the end of July did stem the slide in prices - albeit to a limited degree.
In the US there is a seasonal divide in granular urea barge values. A a premium of up to $25/st was paid for barges already in position along the upper Mississippi River compared to barges waiting for tows in the US Gulf. Inland prices have not benefitted from this divide. This is in part due to the premium already available over barge costs in the truck markets. However, aggressive summer fill offers already are available, at the equivalent to $30-35/st discounts to current inland truck pricing. These tons would be delivered during Q3. This will not only make achieving higher truck values nearly impossible, but also prompt some sellers to price aggressively during Q2 to liquidate old positions.
Highlights of the week
∙Offers to STC in April 10 tender to provide some clarity on regional urea values
∙Egyptian April 18 tender for 150,000 mt conatins complex payment structure
∙Pakistan urea tender not yet in sight after ECC April 1 meeting
∙Brazilian granular values drop to an even $260/mt CFR
∙Middle East returns slide accordingly
∙Netbacks on European granular sales dip below $280s/mt FOB from Egypt
∙Offers for forward European granular positions down sharply
∙Qafco III, V and VI restart
∙Safco V commercial urea output maintained for mid-May
∙Black Sea prills sold by producers to traders around an even $260/mt FOB
Short term outlook
Soft, but a floor may still be in sight in the short term despite the continuing deterioration in netbacks for granular from the Middle East. Market direction will largely depend on the outcome of the April 10 STC tender, but prospects are for some further declines rather than a major price-recovery are minor.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
US Southern Plains: Wet weather still a drag on market
Granular urea is selling as low as $320/st FOB along the Arkansas River, although pricing is about $10/st higher in some areas. Sales have been slowed again by wet weather, and by concerns that demand for urea will disappoint if soybean planting in the region exceeds forecasts.
Summer fill
While distributors wait for better weather for spring business, they have turned to offers for summer fill urea. Suppliers are quoting tons that would be delivered during Q3 at $280-285/st FOB. Even though this material will not be available in time for the current season, the $40/st cheaper price tag compared to prompt sales likely will discourage retailers from risking any carryover tons.
US Midwest: Urea pricing finds support after declines
Granular urea pricing is as low as $320-325/st FOB this week from the Twin Cities in Minnesota, and similar values are suggested from terminals along the upper river system in Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. Postings are $5-10/st higher from inland warehouses that depend on rail for resupply.
Demand is steady, and distributors believe sales should accelerate not only as the ground dries out over the coming weekend, but also as the side-dress season for corn approaches in May and June.
Forward
Summer fill offers are available already, even though most of the spring season remains in the region. Truck values from the Twin Cities for delivery in Q3 are $285-290/st FOB.
US New Orleans: Seasonal divide in barge urea values
Granular urea barges available on a prompt basis at New Orleans traded as low as $265/st FOB New Orleans this week for barges in the Gulf, while granular urea barges available on up-river tows sold up to $290/st FOB.
Overall most trades occured in the low $270s/st FOB, with Chinese and non-Chinese material trading at roughly the same values. The highest price tags were for barges tied up at Cairo Illinois and St. Louis Missouri, which sold as high as $285/st FOB and $290/st FOB respectively basis New Orleans.
Summer fill
Even though the spring season is far from over for US urea consumption, importers and at least one North American producer are offering granular urea for Q3 delivery. Pricing is on a FOB truck basis from inland terminals and by barge, typically priced on a delivered basis. The indicated values in all cases generally equate to $252-254/st FOB New Orleans, allowing for a modest margin to a trader.
US: Urea poured in during February
US granular urea arrivals surged by more more than 200,000 mt during February compared to one year earlier, pushing July-February arrival totals more than 1.1 million mt over arrivals during the first eight months of the prior fertilizer year, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce.
February 2015 imports were 868,377 st (787,786 mt), up substantially from 611,160 st (554,441 mt) one year ealier. Traditional suppliers made up most of the arrivals during the most recent month, with almost all of the those countries adding to their February 2014 volume. The largest suppliers to the US in February 2015 all were in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia at 147,576 st, Qatar at 110,060 st and the UAE at 109,953 st. An exception to the trend was Canada, whose February arrivals in the US fell to 58,057 st from 96,566 st--most likely due to domestic demand in Canada.
The February imports brought the first eight months of the US fertilizer year to 5.51 million st (5 million mt), up a whopping 1.26 million st from 4.25 million st (3.86 million mt) during the prior year period.
Major suppliers during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February were Qatar at 1.09 million st, China at 971,778 st (most of which discharged in July-December) and Canada at 600,103 st.
Exports
US urea exports in February of this year were 11,860 st , (10,759 mt) down from 16,576 st (15,038 mt) one year earlier. In both months most of the tons shipped in very small lots to about a dozen countries. During July-February of the current fertilizer year 149,455 st (135,585 mt) was shipped internationally versus 193,439 st (175,487 mt) during the prior year period. Canada remained the primary destination for US urea, with 120,862 st) loaded for that country.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Central America: Incofe testing urea and AN values April 10
As was indicated in prior issues, Incofe opted to tender April 10 for 20,000 mt prilled FSU urea in combination with 10,000 mt AN and an optional 5,000 mt granular urea for first half May shipment. The prilled urea is to be delivered to Cortes/Honduras (15,000 mt) and Santo Tomas/Guatemala (5,000 mt). The optional 5,000 mt granular urea is destined for Limon/Costa Rica.
The 10,000 mt AN is to be split between Cortes (6,000 mt) and Santo Tomas (4,000 mt).
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic Sea: Limited activity as buyers hold off
Producers and marketers are still attempting to hold netbacks on prilled sales in the $250s/mt FOB, but buying interest at that level is limited, to put it mildly. Unlike marketers shipping from the Black Sea, Baltic suppliers will not benefit from the same proximity to Egypt in the April 18 General Agricultural Cooperative Association tender in Egypt, and will also not be able to consider India a viable outlet due to freight disadvantages.
Reports early in the week of a sale to Agrogen in Mexico at a netback marginally below $247/mt FOB are since termed incorrect as the buyer did not lift the subjects in the deal.
The range for the week is nevertheless set at $247-252/mt FOB to reflect actual deals concluded and a firm offer to cover a cargo at the low end of the range.
Black Sea: Repeat sale of prilled urea suggested close to $260/mt FOB
Despite numerous claims by traders of availability of Black Sea prills from the Black Sea down to $250/mt FOB, DnieproAzot claims a netback around $260/mt FOB Yuzhnyy in a sale this week to a trader short on a prior deal.
Offers are maintained at $260/mt FOB by producers and marketers, but bids are generally some $5/mt lower, and interest is limited as traders try to evaluate impacts of the upcoming April 10 and April 18 tenders in India and Egypt.
Low offers in the April 10 STC session will likely reflect netbacks to the Black Sea in low the $240s/mt FOB, at best, an unattractive proposition to FSU suppliers, but price-corrections to compete cannot be completely excluded.
The April 18 General Agricultural Cooperative Association tender is expected to provide some support for Black Sea prices, but the extended delivery period of three months and cumbersome/extended payment terms may limit producer/trader interest in the session.
Shipments and fully firm nominations for cargos to load from Yuzhnyy are meanwhile at 44,201 mt. Keytrade is expected to nominate a carrier to load 25,000 mt DnieproAzot terminal towards the end of the month.

EUROPE
France: Prices for granular urea flat for spot but forward drops sharply
Recent declines in granular urea values have yet to trigger significant spot purchasing activity in the French Bay. Offers for prompt positions remain around €310-315/mt FCA, but activity is subdued.
The low end implies delivered values at $322/mt CFR basis the euro at $1.075, and reflects around $290/mt FOB Egypt with limited provisions for costs and a margin. Offers for summer-fill and forward positions
are suggested below €290/mt FCA.
In the French Mediterranean, buyers are still citing offers at or marginally below a $305/mt CFR equivalent for prompt positions, in line with recent sales into Spain.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: Pressure builds further, but Indian prospects are good
Middle East producers of granular urea are faced with continuing pressure on prices in all key markets. No new spot deals are reported but firm offers are suggested available around an even $250/mt FOB. Firm offers in Brazil off inbound carriers have dipped to $260/mt CFR. The drop by about $7/mt on last week imply netbacks to sellers no better than $240/mt FOB Middle East and offers below $260/mt CFR in Brazil are suggested available for additional parcels off inbound carriers.
Forward US prices for cargos yet to load are assessed around an even $260/st FOB barge at New Orleans, suggesting netbacks to Middle East producers around $255/mt FOB after deduction of freight, costs and a margin to an intermediary.
Offers in Thailand down to $270/mt CFR did not elicit firm buying interest last week, and buyers appear content to await the outcome in the April 10 STC tender before embarking on additional purchasing.
Offers for April Middle East positions at FIS Cash Settled Swaps April 9 at $255/mt FOB were countered with bids at $250/mt FOB. The bid-offer spread for May was $253/mt-$255/mt FOB. June was however posted at $240-$244/mt FOB.
The above scenario continues to suggest that Middle East product will feature prominently in the April 10 STC tender in India. The regional producers have access to freights for West Coast India significantly below
the rates obtainable by sellers of Chinese product, and can also provide competitive pricing for smaller ports with slower terms for which premiums are historically paid by Indian importers.
Direct offers to STC are expected from PIC and Muntajat while SIUCI will likely provide cover to contract- holders. Saudi Arabian offers are not expected to feature prominently due to planned contract deliveries, including the upcoming Pakistan shipments, and Fertil may opt to await price-developments pursuant to the STC session.
Availability from Qafco that was reduced via the unplanned ammonia outages at Qafco III, V and VI has improved, with all units returned to regular operations in recent days. Sabic still reports that the Safco V urea unit is only expected to reach commercial output in mid-May only.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Pakistan: ECC urea import clearance still awaited
News from Pakistan's Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on the clearance of a new urea tender for the planned import of up to 350,000 mt urea had yet to emerge at press time.
The ECC will be meeting again shortly to clear the procurement and provide the necessary funding. As previously reported, the tender has been cleared by the Fertilizer Review Committee in order to cover the shortfall from the domestic industry due to curtailments in the supply of natural gas.
India: STC tender-offers eagerly awaited
As already expressed, the April 10 STC session will undoubtedly attract significant selling interest, and speculation on prices obtainable by the importer remains rife.
Chinese urea will feature prominently, but recent aggressive quotes from Middle East producers in Brazil and the US are indicative of offers into India well below current prices in China.
Latest Brazilian sales provide netbacks to the Middle East around $240/mt FOB. Should producers be willing to offer accordingly in India, these suggest possible offers from regional suppliers to India below $255/mt CFR West Coast India (WCI). Applying the former, historical spread between WCI and East Coast India (ECI) of about $3/mt in favour of ECI, this would in turn imply that bids to Chinese suppliers would be no higher than $258/mt CFR, for Chinese producer-netbacks in the mid $240s/mt FOB.
While pressure to relieve inventories and disposing of April and May production will be considerable, the level suggested may be termed unrealistically low by Chinese producers, leaving the door open for Iran and traditional Middle East suppliers to India, possibly also to some tonnage from the Black Sea.
Some market participants expressed concern over STC's added payment condition that effectively states that STC will only effect payment to suppliers once STC is in receipt of payment from the DoF. The vast majority of suppliers would however not consider shipping material to STC unless a fully workable LC is in hand and will therefore not be affected by the procedure invoked, except for shipping delays as may incur.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Thailand: Urea activity slow despite drop in prices
Activity in granular urea remains sidelined despite offers for good quality material cited at an even $270/mt CFR. Importers contend that cover could be secured closer to $260/mt CFR.
Imports of urea into Thailand of a mere 36,000 mt in February were down by 80% on February 2014. Malaysia accounted for 20,000 mt and imports from Indonesia were 9,400 mt.
The limited February volume brought January-February imports to 177,600 mt, down by 37.2% on the same period in 2014. Saudi Arabia retained the lead with deliveries of 98,000 mt, but that volume was down by 30% on the prior year. Malaysian shipments were down to 39,000 mt while deliveries from Indonesia were up by 48% to 18,000 mt.
South Korea: Koch reportedly books Namhae granular urea tender
Koch was widely linked with the sale of 6,000 mt granular urea to Namhae via the importer's April 2 tender. Details on the transaction were not released, but local reports indicate the deal was closed around $278/mt CFR, suggesting a netback close to an even $260/mt FOB for product to load from China.
Dongbu has meanwhile floated another tender for the purchase of 6.000 mt granular urea, set to close April 10.
China: Producers resist low prices, but traders still selling
Mainstream offers for prilled urea for export are being maintained by producers around the $265/mt FOB marker ahead of the April 10 STC tender in India, but traders appear confident that cover will be available for the session in the mid- to upper-$250s/mt FOB by the time offers are to be submitted. Offers for granular urea are cited around an even $275/mt FOB, but recent regional deals point to netbacks some $15/mt lower. Producers maintain that such sales are speculative, and claim no interest in covering traders that may have shorted the market.
While prices have been slipping further in the domestic market this week, the netbacks to producers for prilled and granular urea are significantly higher than those perceived in export deals.
Mainstream offers in Shandong were down by about $3/mt equivalent to RMB 1,530-1,560/mt ($247-252/mt) EXW and to RMB 1,500-1,530/mt ($242-247/mt) EXW in Henan. Deals in Shanxi were booked at RMB 1,470/mt ($237/mt) FCA. The low end reflected an export value for the prills in the low $280s/mt FOB.
A similar spread was also evident in granular urea where repeat domestic deals were claimed at RMB 1,550- 1,570/mt ($250-253/mt) FCA in Shanxi. These reflected export values for granular above $290/mt FOB.
Inventories are assessed above last week, with about 900,000 mt combined of prilled and granular urea available for prompt shipment from key ports.
Netbacks on possible sales of Chinese material in India appear set to move significantly below even the more aggressive numbers in the mid $250s/mt FOB indicated by traders. Product from Iran and traditional Middle East producers may well feature in the STC session at CFR levels that would necessitate cover from China in the low $240s/mt FOB if STC targets in the $250s/mt CFR were to be achieved.
NITRATES & SULPHATES
ANALYSIS
Firm AS prices as availability still tight
Ammonium Sulphate
Prices have remained firm amid reduced availability across the board.
Chinese product is still reported available at $128-129/mt FOB as several Chinese plants go down for planned maintenance this month.
Marginal volumes of caprolactam grade AS are available in the Black Sea if needed in the low $150s/mt FOB but no fresh uptake was noted. Steel grade is on offer from Arcelor with prices still pegged in the low $130s/mt FOB. Turkish interest is modest with Igsas issuing an import tender for 5,000 mt caprolactam grade AS closing April 10.
Brazilian AS demand has weakened with enquiries likely to increase in May for the summer application season. Helm is linked to the sale of 15,000 mt ex-China caprolactam grade AS into the country at $158/mt CFR in combination with a DAP/MAP cargo.
UAN
Small volumes of UAN-30 are still being sold into France for prompt delivery at €228-229/mt FCA. Forward sales are moving more slowly with the latest business done still around €195/mt FCA.
Given the relative lack of interest in large volumes for prompt delivery into Europe at present, Abu Qir managed to sell just 4,000 mt UAN-32 slightly below $210/mt FOB to Ameropa for prompt lifting to Spain under its April 7 re-tender. This is at least $30/mt below the producer's previous award in its February 17 session.
Ammonium Nitrate/CAN
The distinctly softer undertone prevails solid nitrates sourced from the FSU, with confirmed deals a few dollars from both sides of the $230/mt FOB marker for Russian AN from the Baltic this week, and similar indications from the Black Sea.
The slide in values appears set to continue, and prospects are for netbacks below $220/ mt FOB in coming weeks.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: AS holds ground as other nitrogens slip
Ammonium sulphate supply remains short in the Midwest, due mostly to reported production hiccups in the US. Distributors in the Midwest are holding out for $320/st FOB in many cases as spot outages are being reported. Higher quotes are likely in some areas.
US Midwest: UAN deliveries starting to stack up ahead of season
Logistics ahead of seasonal demand for UAN already has applied some downward pressure on UAN in the Midwest. Distributors report efforts to find storage space for UAN have forced them to offer more aggressive prices rather than rack up substantial demurrage bills for tank cars. The impact has not been felt in the truck markets, as the difficulty is in finding homes for multiple railcars or even barge volumes. As a result, postings to retailers remain around $10/unit FOB across much of the region.
US: AN arrivals roughly even with prior year during July-February
Ammonium nitrate imports have been relatively steady this fertilizer year when compmared to one year earlier, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce, even though the US has trailed some international values for much of the July-February period. Market watchers are assuming the steady import trend in the face of discouraging pricing was due in part to some key importers choosing to meet their customer base's needs through their historical channels. But declining US demand for non-industrial AN should start to show up in import volumes in coming months.
US AN imports during February were 74,546 st (67,628 mt), down moderately from 84,502 st (76,660 mt) in February 2014. Almost all of the most recent month's imports arrived from the Netherlands at 43,933 st and Canada at 29,999 st.
July-February AN arrivals in the current fertilizer year were up modestly from the prior year period at 358,873 st (325,567 mt) versus 341,041 st (309,390 mt). Key suppliers during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February were Canada at 267,082 st, the Netherlands at 66,236 st and Georgia at 20,723 st.
Exports
While imports have been somewhat static, the US export market during July-February was up over 18% compared to the prior year period. February exports were roughly flat at 35,635 st (32,327 mt) versus 35,444 st (32,154 st). Canada was the primary destination for US AN exports during February at 23,586 st.
However, for the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February versus the prior year period exports increased to 338,111 st (306,732 mt) from 288,775 st (261,975 mt). Key destinations for US AN included Canada at 185,200 st and Mexico at 71,526 st.
US: AS imports up, exports down
Higher ammonium sulphate imports in the first eight months of the current fertilizer year and lower exports reflect anecdotal reports in recent months about the tight supply of AS due to greater demand.
However, despite the overal gain in imports during July-February, February 2015 arrivals in the US were down from February 2014 at 45,318 st (41,112 mt) versus 65,186 st (59,136 mt), according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. Canada and China supplied almost all the imported AS in February, at 29,488 st and 15,713 st respectively.
This brought July-February arrivals to 265,353 st (240,727 mt) compared to 216,068 st (196,015 mt) for the prior year period. Key suppliers to the US throughout July-February of the current fertilizer year included Canada at 154,542 st and China at 109,191 st.
Exports
AS exports from the US were off marginally in February 2015 compared to February 2014 at 108,664 st (98,579 mt) and 115,908 st (105,151 mt) respectively. Brazil at 39,685 st and Canada at 18,993 st were the largest destinations for US AS in February. For the first eight months of the US fertilizer year, exports fell to 898,933 st (815,507 mt) from 1.03 million st (932,020 mt) during the prior year period. Key distinattions for US export AS were mostly in the Americas during July-February of this year, including Brazil at 443,166 st, Peru at 108,267 st, Canada at 58,363 st and the Dominican Republic at 57,551 st.
US: February UAN imports decline still leaves July- February arrivals in surplus
US UAN imports slowed substantially in February compared to the prior fertilizer year, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. However, the one-month drop still leaves arrivals during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year well ahead of the same period during 2013/2014. The causes for the drop in US arrivals were US importers reducing their bids at a time when other European demand was expected to increase.
February imports totaled 337,767 st (306,420 mt) compared to 479,963 st (435,420 mt) one year earlier. The majority of the reduction was seen in shipments from two key US suppliers. February arrivals this year from Trinidad and Tobago fell to 40,228 st from 117,995 st, while imports from Russia fell to 82,906 st versus 163,858 st. Canadian arrivals were up over the relevant months to 45,564 st from 26,947 st.
The February 2015 volume brought the first eight months of the current US fertilizer year's imports to 2.21 million st (2 million mt) versus 1.89 million st (1.72 million mt) for the prior year period. The key traditional suppliers remained the same year over year, with imports from Russia reaching 784,538 st during July- February, followed by Trinidad and Tobago at 502,877 st and Canada at 311,998 st. China, a relative newcomer to the US market, supplied 239,048 st in imports during July-February
Exports
US UAN exports in February were relatively modest at 51,024 st (46,289 st). The destination for 44,311 st of the total was France. July-February export cargos were 263,882 st (239,392 mt). France at 145,471 st and Argentina at 41,868 st were the primary destinations for US UAN, with CF Industries believed to have suppiled all the US exported UAN.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Central America: Incofe to test AN values April 10
As was indicated in prior issues, Incofe opted to tender April 10 for 10,000 mt AN in combination with 20,000 mt prilled FSU urea and an optional 5,000 mt granular urea for first half May shipment. The 10,000 mt AN is to be split between Cortes/Honduras (6,000 mt) and Santo Tomas/Guatemala (4,000 mt). The prilled urea is to be delivered to Cortes (15,000 mt) and Santo Tomas (5,000 mt). The optional 5,000 mt granular urea is destined for Limon/Costa Rica.
Brazil: AS demand dips before summer season
Brazilian demand for AS has decreased slightly with an expectation that enquiries will increase from May in line with the summer application season.
Helm is reported to have sold up to 15,000 mt ex-China caprolactam grade AS into the country at $158/mt CFR in combination with a DAP/MAP cargo.
Granular product is priced at $220/mt CFR.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Only small AS volumes available
Very little caprolactam grade is reported available out of the Black Sea with small volumes from Kemerovo offered in the low $150s/mt FOB for April shipment.
Arcelor closed an export tender for 2,000 mt steel grade AS Ukraine origin April 9 for June shipment. No details regarding bids were known at press time.

(1)Kemerovo
FSU: Netbacks from key markets slide further
Deteriorating values of granular and prilled urea have combined with limited demand for FSU AN to trigger added competition for open business. Netbacks to suppliers are assessed sharply lower on demands for revised quotes from buyers that would require adjustments into the low $220s/mt FOB. Sellers are yet to concede numbers at that level, but the indicative assessment has been made at $228-238/mt FOB for the week.
EUROPE
France: Prompt UAN sales continue
A small number of sales for prompt tonnes continued this week at €228-229/mt FCA. Interest in forward sales remains limited for the time being with recent business struck around €195/mt FCA.
Turkey: Igsas issues AS tender
Igsas issued an import tender for 5,000 mt caprolactam grade AS closing April 10.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Abu Qir sells small volume to Ameropa following tender
Abu Qir managed to sell just 4,000 mt UAN-32 marginally below $210/mt FOB to Ameropa for prompt lifting to Spain under its April 7 re-tender. This is at least $30/mt below the producer's previous award at $239.50/mt FOB in its February 17 session.
Traders had suggested it might be difficult to sell the cargo in Europe given that the tonnes might arrive too late for the current application season.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: AS prices very stable
Chinese prices are reported stable at $128-129/mt FOB with few new enquries noted. Several plant shutdowns are taking place in April including Sinopec's Baling facility.
AMMONIA
ANALYSIS
Continued price pressure amid real lack of ammonia activity
Traders kept themselves busy with contract commitments in the absence of much new business this week. Lacklustre demand prevails as various market participants feel prices might dip further in April before recovering into May.
Values as low as $380/mt FOB Middle East are still considered representative of current market sentiment given on-going price pressure felt from India and the Far East. Recent planned maintenance shutdowns in India have reduced demand at a time when higher phosphoric acid prices are of a concern, and some buyers in the country are now insisting prices should be no higher than $420/mt CFR. Little support is felt in the Far East where buyers in no hurry to purchase are waiting for suppliers to lower spot offers to $450- 460/mt CFR to tempt them.
Faced with such limited demand it is perhaps surprising that Koch is attempting to sell its 40,000 mt Yuzhnny cargo into the Far East this week and not taking the tonnage to the US as was first suggested. SFC said it was still in discussions with Koch at press time for around 30,000 mt to arrive early May off the Clipper Neptun, although it was unclear whether this would be on a spot basis given the parties have an existing contract. Namhae ruled itself out as a buyer of the balance cargo with the likelihood that it would be directed to Taiwan for FPG Formosa.
Should lower values be secured by Asian buyers, substantial downwards pressure will be placed on prices west of Suez. This would mark a change to the rather remarkable stability of Black Sea values assessed unchanged at $400-410/mt FOB for six weeks. Little buying activity has been noted over that period with only the news that OPZ sold 23,000 mt to OCP marginally above $400/mt FOB punctuating the monotony this week.
Shipments to the US Gulf overall should continue in a routine fashion in coming weeks, despite the planned curtailment in Trinidad and Tobago. However, Invista (a specialty chemical producer in Texas owned by Koch) has informed customers that its operations have been entirely shut down due to a malfunction April 5- 6. No further details were available at press time.
CF and some other suppliers are posting higher prices for inland US ammonia this week, presumably aimed at the late season side-dress market. These prices move ammonia costs per unit of nitrogen even further out in front of comparable granular urea values in the Midwest and elsewhere. Any shift to urea and away from
ammonia for side-dress trade primarily used for corn likely would bring the two products into balance by boosting urea use. However, US producers may be raising their ammonia price tags in part to support their UAN postings. Inland UAN postings have changed little while urea has fallen substantially in recent weeks. It remains to be seen if higher ammonia costs do anything to prevent UAN from falling once the application season for that product opens in May-June.
Highlights of the week:
∙Bad weather delays Black Sea vessel loading
∙OPZ sells 23,000 mt to OCP in low $400s/mt FOB
∙Koch's Clipper Neptun now likely fixed for Far East
∙SFC discussing 30,000 mt cargo with Koch
∙Qafco ammonia lines III,V and VI now running
∙Indian values slip further to $420/mt CFR
∙Little progress made on Tampa May price tag talks
Short term outlook
Little change from last week, as ammonia values east and west of Suez remain in danger of falling further owing to market pressure and weak demand.
Ammonia versus DAP
The biggest potential danger to a rebound in global ammonia values in the near term likely is the declining fortunes of DAP and MAP. Global phosphate producers may curtail their production if Q2-Q3 demand from Brazil and India does not support stronger prices for DAP and MAP.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices inched up further this week, continuing their recent recovery and reaching $1,670- 1,700/mt CFR China. Prices may gain further support after benzene prices surged following an explosion at the Dragon Aromatics plant in China.

NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Only anticipation left before May ammonia talks get underway
There is little to do in the US Gulf market but wait for Mosaic and Yara to begin negotiations over Tampa pricing to cover May shipments. Presumably talks will get under way in the next couple of weeks. There would seem to be little doubt that Yara and other suppliers will boost their demands above the $485/mt CFR Tampa price tag covering Mosaic's deliveries to Tampa during April. However, as noted likely it seems Mosaic would like to claw back some of its costs given the decline in DAP pricing in the US and overseas.
US Midwest: Severe weather hampering ammonia application again
There is very little difference between winter storms and spring storms regarding their impact on ammonia applications in the Midwest. This week spring flash floods and tornados have replaced winter's ice storms and snow from Kansas through Indiana.
In much of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Missouri work was stopped in its tracks, leaving distributors and retailers to wait for the ground to dry out again. On the other hand in the northern reaches of Illinois and Indiana corn planting is underway. Ammonia movement in Iowa and Nebraska has been more vigorous, and as much as two-thirds of the ammonia pre-plant material has been applied in those states.
As previously noted, almost all the ammonia available for field work at this stage was purchased under forward programs, leaving the spot market in the region relatively untested. However, distributors east of the Mississippi especially are optimistic about demand for nitrogen for use as side-dress once the corn comes up. Ammonia is arguably over-priced compared to urea in the Midwest, but retailers are likely to raise prices for urea if demand for that product increases for side-dress applications.
For now quotes east of the Mississippi River for new ammonia remain as high as $630/st FOB to retailers, while values generally are closer to $610/st FOB.
US: February ammonia imports move US ahead of prior fertilizer year arrivals
US ammonia imports have exceeded the prior fertilizer year through February thanks to a moderate increase in arrivals during that month compared to February 2014, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce.
Arrivals in the US during February 2015 were 462,500 st (419,311mt), up substantially from 323,747 st (293,701 mt) one year earlier. The increase was split between the two primary ammonia suppliers to the US, Canada at 103,589 st--up from 59,687 st one year earlier and Trinidad and Tobago at 345,176 st--up from 233,779 st.
These gains pushed the US import volume for July-February modestly ahead of the prior-year period, at 3.79 milliont st (3.43 million mt) versus 3.67 million st (3.33 million mt). There was very little variation in volumes among the major suppliers to the US during the first eight months of the current US fertilizer year through February versus the prior-year period. Most of the imports during the most recent period arrived from Trinidad and Tobago at 2.49 million st, Canada at 721,422 st, Russia at 222,805 st and Venezuela at 196,122 st.
The US export total through February of the current fertilizer year was 60,601 st (54,977 mt), down substantially from 124,799 st (113,217 mt) during the first eight months of the prior year. Primary destinations for US ammonia during July-February of this year were South Korea at 42,215 st and Chile at 11,026 st. February exports this year and last year were negligible.

Black Sea: Unfavourable weather prompts Yuzhnny port closure
Heavy winds prompted the closure of Yuhznny port in recent days leading to delays in vessel loading.
It emerged this week that OPZ recently fixed the Gaschem Stade for a voyage to Morocco towards the end of April after a sale to OCP was concluded at $400-405/mt FOB.
Despite renewed suggestions that the on-going dispute between the owners of the Russia-Ukraine ammonia pipeline and OPZ was affecting product deliveries from late last week, it is now reported that an agreement has been reached covering transactions over the next two months. A long term solution will likely follow:

Russia: Stable ammonia output boosts exports
Russian exports of ammonia climbed 121% in January, 2015 to 304,388 mt owing to regular output from TogaliattiAzot and Group DF’s Rossosh facility.
The majority of product (201,951 mt; 66%) was then taken via pipeline to Ukraine’s Yuzhnny port for export.
Black Sea pricing has remained fairly steady in recent weeks around $400-410/mt FOB with demand also stagnant:

MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: All quiet after recent sales
No new sales are reported concluded out of the Middle East following last week's Sabic sales to Mitsui and Mitsubishi under a formula pricing arrangement.
Qafco ammonia lines III, V and VI are reported restarted after a combination of maintenance and technical issues prompted shutdowns in March.
Iran: Exports now targeted beyond India
Iran continued to increase its exports of ammonia in February 2015 to 62,633 mt, an increase of 49% on the previous year.
Since sanctions against the country were lifted interest in Iranian ammonia has increased although some traders were initially reluctant to deal with the country due to financing issues.
A spot sale of Iranian ammonia (16,500 mt) was made into Taiwan in February, marking the first of what is expected to be an increasingly regular occurrence owing to competitively priced product compared with other Middle East origins.
For contract business, India continues to be the central customer taking 45,900 mt in the second month of this year:

India: Reduced buying leads to further price falls
Further weakening in Indian ammonia prices to $420-450/mt CFR is reported amid scarce market activity. A number of fertilizer companies continue to undertake planned maintenance shutdowns, reducing ammonia import requirements.
IFFCO began its 20-day Paradip plant shutdown March 28. In the meantime the buyer will receive 23,000 mt from Sabic off the Gas Columbia April 9 followed by 40,000 mt off the Clipper Mars May 10-20.
Deepak Fertilisers received an additional 7,500 mt April 8 from CIFC after securing just over 10,000 mt from Sabic earlier this month:

ASIA AND OCEANIA
Indonesia: Parna Raya ammonia unit running well
Parna Raya's Bontang ammonia plant continues to run well. Trammo confirmed it will lift 11,500 mt mid-April on an as yet undetermined vessel to be used against contract commitments in Souh Korea.
Taiwan: FPG Formosa singled out as possible Koch cargo buyer
FPG Formosa is in the frame to receive a small spot cargo from Koch off the Clipper Neptun as CPDC and TFC ruled themselves out as buyers of the tonnage. The cargo is expected to arrive in Taiwan early May after discharging as much as 30,000 mt in South Korea.
CPDC said it had also been approached by a trader to gauge interest in the purchase of cargo from Petronas for June delivery. The buyer declined the offer for now owing to a planned maintenance shutdown of its Toufen caprolactam plant from mid-April to mid-May.
Contract values are assessed around $470-480/mt CFR.
South Korea: Clipper Neptun cargo may be headed for
SFC
SFC said discussions with Koch over a possible purchase of up to 30,000 mt ammonia off the Clipper Neptun which is currently loading in Yuzhnny are on-going. The cargo should arrive in the Far East early May.
Namhae reports it has not yet received any spot offers from Koch.
Contract values are pegged no lower than $470/mt CFR with buyers having resisted additional purchases until now in the hope a price floor would soon be established. The consensus is this could be around $450/mt CFR.
SFC said it will receive 25,000 mt contract tonnage from Yara off the Viking River in April, followed by 23,000 mt from Sabic in May.
PHOSPHATES
ANALYSIS
Market dominated by expectations due to thin volume of trades
Most major suppliers are waiting for the calendar to bring importers in Brazil and India back to the marketplaces, leaving endusers in other markets to pick off cargoes offered by those producers feeling inventory pressure in the near term.
This enabled buyers to convince Russia's EuroChem to meet marketplace expectations for a DAP/MAP cargo for Argentina and to lead to further expectations that new business to Argentina/Uruguay would have to be even cheaper.
Traders working in Brazil's market said carryover sitting in warehouses in that country means any new spot cargoes would have to be priced at least $10/mt below current offer levels and it seems unlikely such business would do much more than lead to even lower price demands on subsequent shipments.
As previously reported, India's last round of buying has left it comfortable in the near term, especially given the drop in value of the rupee against the US dollar. As the Chinese domestic season for phosphate applications winds down towards the end of this month or early May, port inventories in that country are expected to embolden buyers for India to make bids below $480/mt CFR, especially if Saudi output is building. US export giant Mosaic may also participate with June cargoes, as returns at $480/mt CFR are not far below current US barge values.
If there is good news here for suppliers it is that low prices inevitably are the cure for low prices. India's clout means whatever price is concluded for that market typically sets the floor during Q2 and Q3 for global values. Other buyers can expect to see higher demands once Indian buying returns.
In the US domestic market, sales of imported DAP continue at a few dollars either side of $410/st FOB, the equivalent of $452/mt FOB US Gulf, suggesting Mosaic likely will come down to meet Brazilian expectations once pricing there is more settled. For now the producer is happy to holdout at a higher export indication until most of the US seasonal demand is met.
Highlights of the Week
∙Argentina/Uruguay aim to pick off cheaper offers while others on side line
∙Saudi continues to sell cargoes at top of range to India
∙Rumours continue of US DAP cargoes for Q2-Q3 shipment to India
∙SE Asia DAP sales completed across wide range
∙European contract price talks for phosacid finally underway, maybe
Two key enduser markets, the US and China, will have met their seasonal demands in coming weeks. This will leave producers in those countries to consider their price demands primarily on the backs of how much DAP/MAP is worth in India and Brazil. While this should lead to lower prices in May, it should also set the stage for a rebound as those endusers sweep up the lowest priced DAP and MAP. The combination of international sales and empty domestic systems in the US and China should enable suppliers to seek higher prices later in the summer.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Weather interrupts DAP work across much of region
After some positive reports with regard to demand last week, less phosphate application work was reported in recent days as storms including tornados moved through the Corn Belt.
Indications for DAP in Illinois and Iowa are as low as $460-465/st FOB this week, but quotes are a further $5-10/st higher from warehouses limited to resupply by rail.
US Southern Plains: Flat while wet weather prevails
DAP is not moving in significant volumes so far this week, as much of the region outside of Texas is too wet for field work. Distributors are more optimistic that ground conditions will have improved by late next week. In the meantime, postings still are cited at $460-480/st FOB, but expectations are that most business will be completed at the low end of this range.
US New Orleans: Market divided between up-river, Gulf indications
Business has been done at $405-410/st FOB New Orleans this week for DAP barges discharging in the US Gulf, but barges already moving north have changed hands at $415-420/st FOB, according to some traders. Nevertheless, despite some bullishness for barges available off tows already moving along the Mississippi River system, bids are lower for load dates or barges still in the Gulf. Bids for these positions, albeit so far unsuccessful this week, have been made at $400-405/st FOB.
US Tampa: Brazil not interested in DAP/MAP offers, India rumours continue
Mosaic reported no new export trade this week, following last week when the only business cited by the producer was priced on a formula for Latin America. Expectations are that Mosaic and some other global producers are waiting for greater interest late next month from Brazil. In recent weeks Mosaic has little interest in competing for business in Argentina and other markets that will likely only lower price expectations further in key Brazilian trade.
Meanwhile, rumours persist that Mosaic is trying to build an export line-up to its own system in India and other importers in that country. Expectations are that the producer might load two large cargos through June, but so far Mosaic has declined to comment on the speculation. Likely returns from India given current prices in that country and the weakness in the prompt US market make India a reasonable alternative for the US producer in coming weeks.
In the meantime, the US Tampa benchmark likely is not better than $470/mt FOB, assuming small cargoes to Central America still could yield higher returns than are indicated for Brazil and elsewhere.
US: DAP and MAP arrivals jumped in February
Importers showed improved timing in February, bringing 95,639 st (86,763 mt ) of DAP and 28,427 st
( 25,789 mt) of MAP to the US just a few weeks ahead of the annual re-opening of the upper Mississippi River system, according to the US Department of Commerce. One year earlier February DAP arrivals were just 2,341 st (2,124 mt) and MAP imports totaled just 3,024 st (2,743 mt).
Almost all of February 2015's DAP imports and also all of the gain between the relevant months was credited to imports from Morocco of 60,186 st and Russia of 33,191 st. MAP imports were almost entirely concentrated in Russian hands in February 2015, with 24,771 st discharging from that country.
DAP arrivals during July-February also were up compared to the prior year period at 448,516 st (406,891 mt). China took the lion's share of this trade, with 282,224 st imported mostly during July-December. Russia supplied 76,485 st of DAP during July-February. MAP imports in the first eight months of the US fertilizer
year through February were 904,090 st (820,185 mt), compared to 296,770 st (269,228 mt). International MAP suppliers to the US inclued Morocco at 326,597 st, China at 253,162 st and 236,845 st.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Bids and offers may remain far apart until May
Brazil's market is weighed down by carryover from the prior season, a weak domestic currency versus the US dollar and strikes in the transportation industries.
Bids and offers for new MAP and DAP cargoes in Brazil are at least $10/mt apart and neither buyers nor sellers expect to see that situation change until May, and new cargoes may not discharge before June in significant volumes.
Importers are looking to buy from US, Russian or North African suppliers at $465/mt CFR for MAP and DAP today, a value that likely will not be accepted by those sellers in the near term. Offers are suggested at $475/mt CFR for now, and Chinese material is indicated even higher.
Argentina/Uruguay: Trader buys DAP/MAP cargo, price tags still inching down
EuroChem sold 20,000 mt MAP and 20,000 mt DAP on a single cargo to load for Argentina and Uruguay in April.
While details are sparse, a previous purchase by Profertil below $480/mt CFR suggests this latest business was around $475/mt CFR for both products. This indicates a return to EuroChem of about $445/mt FOB whether it loads from the Black Sea or the Baltic, and assuming a margin for the trader involved, rumoured to be Nitron.
While EuroChem still has some April availability, a planned turnaround at its Kingisepp plant in May will limit forward availability, and may allow it to focus on its higher-priced customers in Europe, rather than selling further afield in the coming weeks.
EUROPE
Europe: Weak levels of NPK activity
NPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months, with only small deals being made despite being deep into normal spring buying season.
Weak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks and apprehension on the farmers' buying side have all impacted NPK demand and even the reduced prices are failing to attract buyers.
Indications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively. Triple 15 offers are being made as low as $325/mt FOB, according to sources, but buyers are either disinterested or are bidding significantly lower.
With OCP bringing on its new 1 million mt integrated granulation plant this month, Russian NP/NPK business will become ever more vulnerable to competition from Morocco, particularly in Africa.
We have already begun to see increased Russian (PhosAgro and Acron) activity in the Indian market, a market that Russian producers have foregone in the last two years.
Europe: Phosacid negotiations expected
The market still awaits news of Q2 phosphoric acid contract negotiations for Europe. The main players were unavailable for comment this week, indicating talks may be underway.
Europe: Europe DAP demand all but over
The DAP season over in France and the southern part of West Europe, and the end is approaching in Germany, though the season will continue through April for corn application.
Eurochem is expected to announce a new price for April but in the meantime DAP prices, almost exclusively Lithuanian, are holdiing in the range of $525-530/mt FCA Terneuzen.
Some limited demand for DAP in the local truck markets reported.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: 40,000 mt rock cargo will be country's first higher-grade export
Egypt is nearing its first ever export sale of higher grade phosphate rock with a 40,000 mt cargo expected to load within days.
A vessel is understood to be on its way to Safaga on the Red Sea coast.
The shipment, negotiated through a trader at an undisclosed price, will be delivered to India. The buyer has not been named.
Misr Phosphate was awarded a licence last year by the Egyptian government to operate the Red Sea Mine, previously held by Red Sea Mining Corp.
Misr began management of the site in September 2014 and plans to increase production to as much as 100,000 mt/month phosphate rock (30-32% P2O5 or 66-70% BPL). There are currently stocks at the mine of about 250,000 mt.
Egypt has taken steps to become more competitive in the global phosphate rock market by redistributing some mining licences. The country has only ever exported lower-grade rock, with a maximum P2O5 content of 30%.
One Egyptian trader said last month that negotiations to supply India with rock from the Red Sea Mine and a price of $93 FOB Egypt had been floated.
Tunisia/Turkey: GCT and Gubretas still locked in DAP talks
As of last week GCT had not indicated anything firm for April pricing. With the European season almost over, the Tunisians are likely to be concentrating on talks with Turkish buyers.
As of last week, Morocco's OCP was indicating $515/mt FOB in Southern Europe, which may mean a deal close to $505-510/mt FOB is possible. GCT likely will aim to match the same range.
Saudi Arabia: Ma'aden and Sabic agree Indian sales
Ma'aden is now fully committed through April and early May after agreeing recent sales into India.
Ma'aden sold a 30,000 mt DAP cargo to Kribcho in India at $489/mt CFR for delivery at the end of April.
A second cargo from the Saudi producer of about 35,000 mt was also sold into India at the same price for loading in the second half of April. Market sources suggest the buyer was IPL, though this could not be confirmed at the time of writing.
Ma'aden says it is now fully committed through April and early May but has received enquiries from May onwards from India, Pakistan, East Africa and South America. The company's last shipment to Latin America was to Yara and priced on a formula.
The seller last week indicated it was seeking $500/mt CFR for new business into Pakistan.
Under a recent MoU, Sabic sold a second DAP cargo to Zuari of 30-35,000 mt at about $485-86/mt CFR India with delivery expected by April 20. The first cargo of 30-35,000 mt was also priced similarly at $485- 486/mt CFR Mundra, according to sources, and arrived in the last week of March.
Ma'aden has now signed contracts with three Indian buyers for 700,000 mt to be delivered between April this year and March, 2016. The price will be negotiated before each shipment.
Morocco: OCP plans for Brazil still unclear
As reported last week, OCP plans to switch its attention to increased phosacid and NPS shipments through April.
Following on from last month's settlement of phosacid prices in India, OCP will now focus its attention on shipping increased volumes of acid from Morocco. It will ship reduced quantities of DAP/MAP in April while balancing granulation according to demand. The final three 50,000 mt NPS shipments for Ethiopia will be loaded through April/May along with additional NPKs for Nigeria and West Coast Africa, as detailed in last week's report.
DAP/MAP production will be limited with just 20-30,000 mt allocated for the European market and nothing firm as yet for Brazil. Serious phosphate demand in Brazil is widely said to be 30-40 days away.
After loading 260,000 mt for the US in February/March, it is believed OCP plans no more US April shipments but has allocated 1-2 cargoes for Q2.
OCP indicated a price last week for DAP of $515/mt FOB for Europe.
Q2 discussions for phosphoric acid into the Northwest European market are expected to be taking place imminently.
Kenya: KTDA awards 70,000 mt NPK tender
The Kenya Tea Development Agency awarded its annual tender for about 70,000 mt NPK 26-5-5 to Mekatrade after receiving four offers.
Singapore-based Mekatrade will deliver product from Uralchem at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.
Yara submitted the highest offer at $375/mt CFR. Ameropa came in at $367 CFR and a third trader offered at $368/mt CFR.
The volumes will be delivered in two shipments, with the first in July and the second a month later, an official at KTDA told Fertilizer Week. A production period of 28 days is required once the letter of credit has been issued.
The original tender was for 69,000 mt.

India: Rock imports to date for April reach 333,000 mt
Indian imports of phosphate rock in April are so far scheduled to reach 333,000 mt. The full line-up to date is as follows:
India Phosphate Rock Arrivals, 2015
Bangladesh: BCIC awards 30,000 mt rock tender
Wilson International won BCIC's, awarded on April 9, for 30,000 mt 72% BPL minimum phosphate rock, with its offer of Jordanian rock $159.43/mt CFR Chittagong. The rock will feed the phosphoric acid unit at BCIC's TSP plant.
India: MFL receives two offers in phosacid tender
MFL received two offers in its 10,000 mt phosphoric acid tender from Sterlite and Aries. The offers are likely to open in the next one or two days. The tender was due to close on April 6.
The latest phosacid arrivals in India are as follows:
India: Phosphoric acid Arrivals – February/March/April 2015
Pakistan: Still no new DAP sales confirmed
Firming freights have meant producers have increased their price ideas for product delivered into Karachi.
Saudi's Ma'aden indicated last week it was seeking $500/mt CFR for new business in Pakistan.
India: Three April Saudi DAP cargoes confirmed
Some new business was reported this week to India from Saudi Arabia even as buyers awaited an annoucement on the new NBS rates.
Last year the NBS rates were announced on April 4 but not until May 2 in 2013.
Kribhco confirmed it purchased a 30,000 mt cargo of Saudi DAP from Ma'aden at $489/mt CFR for delivery at the end of April. A second Ma'aden cargo of about 35,000 mt was also sold into India at the same price for loading in the second half of April. Market sources suggest the buyer was IPL, though this could not be confirmed at the time of writing.
These two sales increase the top end of the DAP Bulk CFR India Spot price by $3/mt. The benchmark is now assessed at $480-489/mt CFR.
Zuari has bought a second cargo of 30-35,000 mt from Sabic (under an MoU) at about $485-486/mt CFR with delivery expected by April 20. The first cargo of 30-35,000 mt was also priced at $485-486/mt CFR Mundra, according to sources, and arrived in the last week of March.
Ma'aden has now agreed MoUs with three Indian buyers for 700,000 mt to be delivered
between April this year and March 2016. The price will be negotiated before each shipment. The exact division is unclear though Kribcho has agreed to take about 250,000 mt, Zuari will take 100,000 mt leaving a third buyer, thought to be IPL, with about 350,000 mt.
PhosAgro is visiting several buyers including IPL/IFFCO and the two companies are considering the purchase of two to three DAP cargoes once clarity emerges over the NBS.
Price ideas for Chinese DAP are around $480 CFR with Saudi product in the mid-to-high $480s/mt CFR.
RCF is expected to take another one or two days to finalise its DAP tender.
With regard to the MRP, the current range for most producers is between INR 23,300-23,800/mt. IFFCO has maintained a lower MRP through Q1 at INR 23,200 but is planning to increase this by INR 500/mt to INR 23,700/mt. TCL, one of OCP's JV partners, is heard to have raised its MRP already to INR 24,260/mt.
India: January DAP imports up nearly 40%
India imported 116,781 mt of DAP in January, a 39% increase on January 2013, according to GTIS data.
In January, Saudi Arabia supplied 65,810 mt or 56% of the total import volume, while the US supplied 50,970 mt or 44% of the total import volume.
GTIS data for the full calendar year 2014 showed Indian DAP imports at 3.8 million mt, higher than 2013 when just 3.6 million mt were imported. Imports over the previous four calendar years had averaged 5.5 million mt DAP.
India imported 199,788 mt of phosacid in January, an 83% increase on its January 2014 imports, according to GTIS data. Almost 80% of the imports came from OCP which limited its export shipments to only its joint venture partners during Q1. For Q2 it is expecting to increase volumes to a level similar to Q4 2014 when around 100-120,000 mt P2O5 per month was supplied from Morocco.
India: January NPK imports at 2-year high
India imported 39,525 mt of NPKs in January, its largest January figures since 2012 and more than half of its full-year 2014 NPK imports, according to GTIS data.
In January, Russia supplied 38,455 mt, or 97% of the total import volume, a figure which is more than Russia provided in the whole of 2014.
In the full year 2014, India only imported 65,286 mt of NPKs, with more than half coming from Russia. The high January imports may be a sign that India could signal a return to the levels of yearly NPK imports seen between 2010 and 2012.
NPK production in India between April 2014 and February is up by 13% at 7.3 million mt as DAP producers switched to NPKs in the face of higher phosphoric acid prices.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Phosphate prices showing signs of further weakness
Chinese phosphate prices are showing further signs of weakness as major MAP demand in Brazil is yet to emerge and domestic DAP consumption is currently limited. Exports are expected to be high through April.
Phosphate and NPK producers in China can comfortably afford the current sulphur price, but are holding off as they anticipate sulphur will decline further in the weeks ahead.
Concern among sulphur suppliers at the lack of Chinese demand is causing producers to drop prices, but this is yet to stimulate a buy-side reaction. Chinese delivered sulphur is currently assessed at $150-160/mt CFR.
Some Chinese phosphate producers have planned maintenance in April and May, so operating rates are expected to decline in May, with normal production expected to resume from late June.
Distributors and traders say small and mid-tier phosphate companies may delay maintenance as they seek to supply the export market from April, rather than from late May/June. These smaller producers are likely to produce at rates of around 80% to maximise exports.
For the largest producers (such as YTH and Wengfu), for whom maintenance was scheduled in May, plants are not expected take complete shutdowns. Operating rates are instead likely to drop to 60-70% from 80% for three or four weeks, before normal production is resumed.
Exports to India between February and April will have been comparatively high due to a need by Indian importers to replenish stocks ahead of the next season and on the Chinese side, facilitated by the removal of seasonal export restrictions from the beginning of 2015. The weaker RMB has also encouraged Chinese suppliers to take advantage of additional export opportunities.
The lower end of DAP Bulk FOB China Spot is assessed by Fertilizer Week as slightly lower on last week at $460-470/mt FOB. Most large producers have booked their production through April and don't have product available for prompt sale. However, domestic DAP sales are said to be very slow, not just for seasonal reasons but also due to the price advantage MAP and NPKs currently hold over DAP.
Some regional markets such as Northwest China, demand has been postponed due to extreme weather conditions. Ploughing time has been pushed back by at least one or two weeks. Demand in Northern and Northeast China is also limited.
Producers will not currently move much volume to ports as they do not expect to see a sharp increase in monthly shipments in April or May, hence there has been no obvious growth of port inventory.
As seen last week, MAP remains under pressure. Chinese granular 11-44-0 can sell at $350-360/mt FOB, according to sources in China, with granular MAP 10-50-0 at around $405/mt FOB. MAP Bagged EXW 11- 44-0 is assessed at RMB 1,900-2,000/mt, a decline of about RMB 125/mt week on week, with 10-50-0 at RMB 2,100-2,200/mt, down RMB 75/mt on last week.
Major buyers are still said to be traders rather than end users with demand and supply roughly balanced. No negotiations are not yet under way for deliveries after mid May.
Some traders are reportedly eyeing exports to the US of granular 10-50-0 or 11-52-0 for June onwards, but no business was heard to have been concluded at the time of writing.
Indonesia: NPK imports double in 2014
Indonesia imported 423,187 mt of NPKs in 2014, almost doubling its full-year figures from 2013 and the country's highest yearly imports since 2008, according to GTIS.
NPK demand in Indonesia is steadily growing, partly to feed rising palm oil production.
The country imported more than 50% of the NPK volumes from Malaysia, while 35%came from Norway.
Vietnam: Australian DAP bought at $500 CFR
Incitec Pivot is reported to have sold a cargo of around 20,000 mt Australian DAP into Vietnam at $500/mt CFR for end April loading. The producer was not immediately available to confirm the trade.
Elsewhere in Vietnam, cargoes of bagged DAP were traded at $490/mt CFR Ho Chi Minh and cross-border trade with China was reported at $475-480/mt CFR.
POTASH
ANALYSIS
Suppliers struggle to raise potash prices as market awaits Indian contract
Prices are generally stable in the potash spot markets this week as players continue to await news on the new Indian contract and suppliers struggle to achieve higher prices after a disappointing Q1.
BPC, Canpotex and APC have now signed firm quantities of 1.7 million, 1.8 million and 600,000 mt respectively in their contract talks with China. This follows BPC's decision to sign a $10/mt increase on the
previous $305/mt CFR price ahead of Canpotex and Uralkali. The volumes represent strong demand with domestic producer QSL planning to increase sales volumes to 5.0 million mt this year.
Surprisingly, Uralkali is yet to agree quantities. Talks are almost concluded and an announcement should be made by early next week, a company spokesman said. The delay is because Uralkali is looking at the option of signing an agreement with three channels rather than its usual two (CNAMPGC and Sinofert) but Uralkali noted that it is not pushing for extra volumes than last year.
Uralkali said this week that its Q1 production fell 8% year on year to 2.7 million mt and it may review its current production target for 2015.The company currently has a 10.2 million mt output target for 2015 following the Solikamsk-2 flood which represents a 15-16% fall on full-year 2014 production levels.
ICL has yet to sign a deal, with some sources arguing that the company is awaiting an agreement with striking workers before negotiating volumes to China, which may be some time. Strikes which began in mid- February continue at the Dead Sea Works with little end in sight. With the total loss of operations at DSW during the strikes it is likely that ICL has foregone more than 500,000 mt of production already.
While prices in the spot markets are generally stable, Brazilian potash prices dipped further this week despite the Chinese contract. Brazilian prices have fallen to a dismal $325-345/mt CFR from $335-350/mt CFR last week with stiff competition, limited buyer interest and high supply levels forcing down the price. Brazilian values have now fallen by roughly $35-40/mt in the first four months of 2015 and suppliers' hopes of pushing above $350/mt in the near term are looking more and more unlikely.
European prices are holding at the €300-310/mt CIF range with producers struggling to achieve €315/mt CIF amid high levels of resistance and a possible reduction in consumption. The standard potash price is currently seen around €275-280/mt CFR, a very weak price which translates to roughly $295/mt CFR at current exchange rates, far below the new $315/mt CFR Chinese contract price.
Malaysian standard MOP is being quoted at $315-325/mt CFR with only small quantities being booked and little buying interest in the country until the next tender season in May. Indonesian and Vietnamese prices remain around $330-335/mt CFR and $340-345/mt CFR respectively.
After some discounting earlier this season, granular potash values in the US Midwest appear to have found firm footing a few dollars either side of $400/st FOB. Prices at terminals along the Arkansas river are quoted at $390-395/st FOB but further rain this week cut into the trend towards greater field work seen last week.
Canada exported 1.5 million mt of potash in February, a 32% increase on February 2014 and the largest February exports since 2005, according to GTIS data. As a result, Canada has now exported 3.0 million mt of potash in the year to date, 28% more than the same period in 2014.
The potash market continues to await news on contract talks in India, with the Nutrient Based Subsidy rates still to be announced. Rates are expected by the end of next week and the contract should be signed shortly after. It is likely that the contract will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, at around $330- 337/mt CFR with 180 days. Suppliers will hope the new price can help them to push up spot prices through Q2.
Highlights of the Week:
∙APC signs 600,00 mt volumes contract to China
∙Uralkali Q1 production falls 8% y-o-y, at 2.7 million mt
∙Uralkali may review 10.2 million mt out put target for 2015
∙Brazil gMOP price falls to $325-345/mt CFR from $335-350/mt CFR
∙European gMOP price stable, €300-310/mt CIF
∙SE ASIA price stable $315-345/mt CFR
∙US Midwest price firms, $390-400/st FOB
∙China domestic price stable, RMB 2,050-2,200/mt FCA
∙Canada exports up 32% in February at 1.5 million mt - GTIS
∙Indian MOP imports down 14% in February at 178,000 mt - FAI
∙Indonesia imported 2.9 million mt of MOP in 2014, up 29% - GTIS
∙MFL India gets two offers in 15,000 mt tender, IPL's $324/mt CFR lowest
∙Indian NBS expected next week, contract to be signed by end of April
Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the
Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to
the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.

NORTH AMERICA
US Southern Plains: After last week's start, field work slowed by more rain
Granular potash and other products still are being applied on higher ground in Oklahoma and Arkansas, but further rain this week cut into the trend towards greater field work seen last week. Texas still is seing good activity, and corn sowing is underway in that state.
Quotes for granular potash are $390-395/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River.
US Midwest: Seasonal pricing for potash appears set
After some discounting earlier this season, granular potash values appear to have found firm footing a few dollars either side of $400/st FOB in the Midwest.
This level likely will be challenged in coming weeks, as distributors are expected to cut values in order to end the season empty. This is due to the prevailing view that crop prices will decline in coming months, bringing pressure on all input costs for the fall season.
Canada: Potash exports at 3.0 million mt in Jan-Feb
Canada exported 1.5 million mt of potash in February, a 32% increase on February 2014 and the largest February exports since 2005, according to GTIS data.
As a result, Canada has now exported 3.0 million mt of potash in the year to date, 28% more than the same period in 2014.
The country exported 774,944 mt to the US in February, with 221,163 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.
Including the exports from Portland, in February Canpotex exported 189,992 mt to Indonesia, 164,098 mt to China, 124,328 mt to Brazil, 72,393 mt to Malaysia and 58,121 mt to India.
Canada exported 17.3 million mt of potash in 2014, a 7.8% increase on the previous year and the largest yearly potash exports from the country since 2007. The country exported 9.2 million mt to the US in 2014, of which 2.5 million mt was re-exported out of the US from Portland.


US: Potash imports up 30% in Jan-Feb
The US imported 1.0 million mt of potash in February, 43% more than the same month a year earlier and the highest February imports since 2010, according to GTIS data.
The figures bring US year-to-date imports to 2.0 million mt, a 30% increase on Jan-Feb 2013 levels.
Canadian producers sent 774,944 mt to the US in February, with 221,163 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.
The US also imported 107,191 mt from Uralkali, 66,175 mt from BPC, 34,945 mt from SQM and 24,610 mt from ICL.
Total US imports reached 10.5 million mt of potash in 2014, 10% (1 million mt) more than in 2013. After tonnage was re-exported through Portland, net imports were 8.0 million mt.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Prices slip further despite Chinese contract
Brazilian prices have fallen to $325-345/mt CFR from $335-350/mt CFR last week with stiff competition, limited buyer interest and high supply levels forcing down the price.
Brazilian prices had seemed to have hit their floor at $335-345/mt CFR following the Chinese contract agreement but high levels of competition have continued to force down the key spot price. Brazilian prices have now fallen by roughly $35-40/mt in the first four months of 2015.
Brazilian real depreciation and low agricultural prices have hit Brazilian farmers, who invested heavily last year. As a result, distributers and importers are defending their margins and resisting any price push at this point.
Many suppliers say they are not offering below $335/mt CFR and still hope that they can begin moving the price back up towards the $350/mt level.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Belarus: Belaruskali doubles choice of products to China
Belaruskali more than doubled the range of products it sold to China in 2014, Belarusian state news agency BelTA reported on April 8.
Previously Belaruskali's export arm BPC sold just three types of potassium chloride to China, but in 2014 the company sold seven types of product to China and it continues to diversify its merchandise line to the country.
"Some headway has also been secured with regard to other new kinds of products that consumers may be interested in," BPC's press service told BelTA.
BPC, which surprisingly signed a new Chinese contract at $315/mt CFR in March ahead of Uralkali and Canpotex, is now looking to increase its client base in China and to establish direct relationships with the manufacturers of compound fertilizers.
In 2015, BPC is set to ship more than 1.7 million mt of potash to China after signing agreements with CNAMPGC, Sinochem and CNOOC. In 2014, China imported almost 1.8 million mt from BPC, more than double its imports from the Belarusian potash company in 2013.
Russia: Uralkali's Q1 potash production falls 8%
Russian potash producer Uralkali has already been hit by lost volumes from its flooded SK-2 mine with production down 8% year on year in Q1, according to the company.
The company produced 2.7 million mt of potash in Q1 compared with 2.93 million mt of potash in the same period a year earlier.
Uralkali said production rates fell due to the flood at SK-2 and lower levels of demand in key markets. It added that the spring thaw at Solikamsk will add to water levels in the flooded mine making conditions more difficult.
Uralkali may also review its 10.2 million mt output target for 2015 depending on demand in the market and further developments at the Solikamsk-2 mine. Uralkali produced 12.1 million mt in 2014.
The company has pledged to keep its Solikamsk-1 mine, linked to the SK-2 site via an underground passageway, from flooding, Bloomberg reported today.
EUROPE
Europe: Weak levels of NPK activity
NPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months, with only small deals being made despite being deep into normal spring buying season.
Weak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks, cold weather and apprehension on the farmers' buying side have all impacted NPK demand. The lower prices are still failing to attract buyers.
Indications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively. Triple 15 offers are being made as low as $325/mt FOB, according to sources, but buyers are either disinterested or are bidding significantly lower.
With OCP bringing on its new 1 million mt integrated granulation plant this month, Russian NP/NPK business will become ever more vulnerable to competition from Morocco, particularly in Africa.
We have already begun to see increased Russian (PhosAgro and Acron) activity in India, a market that Russian producers have foregone in the last two years.
Europe: Prices hold at low level
European granular prices remain in the €300-310/mt CIF range as suppliers continue to push for €315/mt CIF levels.
Most suppliers recently increased their granular prices to €315-320/mt FCA. More deals are being made at the €315/mt FCA level but we are still yet to see deals reach €320/mt FCA and suppliers have begun to note a possible reduction in consumption due to colder weather across Europe.
The standard potash price is currently seen around €275/mt CFR, a very weak price which translates to roughly $295/mt CFR at current exchange rates, far below the new $315/mt CFR Chinese contract price.
Suppliers hope that weather issues are soon to improve and applications will build up, helping achieve target prices.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Kenya: KTDA awards 70,000 mt NPK tender
The Kenya Tea Development Agency awarded its annual tender for about 70,000 mt NPK 26-5-5 to Mekatrade after receiving four offers.
Singapore-based Mekatrade will deliver product from Uralchem at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.
Yara submitted the highest offer at $375/mt CFR. Ameropa came in at $367 CFR and a third trader offered at $368/mt CFR.
The volumes will be delivered in two shipments, with the first in July and the second a month later, an official at KTDA told Fertilizer Week. A production period of 28 days is required once the letter of credit has been issued.
The original tender was for 69,000 mt.
South Africa: Potash imports up 42% in February
South Africa imported 28,490 mt of potash in February, a 42% increase year on year, according to GTIS data.
ICL sent 17,500 mt and SQM sent 10,192 mt during February.
The country's year-to-date imports are down 33% compared to Jan-Feb 2013 after almost no potash was imported in January.
South Africa imported 381,515 mt of potash in 2014, a 39% increase on the previous year and its highest ever level by a significant margin, according to GTIS data.

INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Sri Lanka: MoA tender awarded after delay
Sri Lanka's Ministry of Agriculture has finally awarded its tender for 24,000 mt of potash, following an appeal against the original decision.
The tender, for bagged potash to be available for distribution in May, originally closed on February 16 and was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd with Uralkali tonnage after they made the lowest offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit.
ETA appealed the decision after offering the lowest price on a 270 days credit basis, believed to be the main purchasing term, with $349.87/mt.
The appeal was rejected in March but the official award was not made until last week.
India: Potash continues to arrive ahead of new contract
The potash market continues to await news on contract talks in India, with the Nutrient Based Subsidy rates still to be announced.
The new NBS rates are now expected before April 16 and the contract should be signed before the end of the month.
With the contract still not signed, RCF has again extended its tender for at least 145,000 mt of potash until April 23 and MMTC is unlikely to announce results of its tender until after that point.
Suppliers were last heard looking for at least a $20/mt increase on the current $322/mt with 180 days credit deal but buyers were pushing for a rollover. It is likely that the contract will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, at around $330-337/mt CFR with 180 days.
More than 180,000 mt has already been booked for April arrival into India despite contract talks due to take place, with most deals sent at the end of March under the previous contract but some believed to be on a provisional price basis ahead of the new contract. In the next week, 53,221 mt is set for arrival from two BPC shipments to IFFCO and IPL.

India: Potash imports pass 4.0 million mt in fertilizer year
India's potash imports reached 4.0 million mt between April and February this year, according to the latest FAI data.
Imports are over 900,000 mt higher year on year and already 800,000 mt more than the full fertilizer year 13/14.
So far in the fertilizer year potash imports are 30% higher compared to the same period 12 months earlier and Rabi season MOP imports have reached 1.7 million mt, already 18% more than the entire 13/14 Rabi season.
In February, India's potash imports were 178,000 mt, a 14% fall year on year. March imports are expected at around 150,000 mt with most suppliers having already sent their entire contracted volumes and are looking to limit Indian shipments to help in contract negotiations.
NPK production between April and February reached 7.3 million mt, an increase on 6.5 million mt during the same period in the previous fertilizer year.
Rising levels of NPK output mean increasing demand for potash, which is not produced in India, and this trend is expected to increase as DAP producers increase NPK production to offset high phosacid prices.

India: January NPK imports at 2-year high
India imported 39,525 mt of NPKs in January, its largest January figures since 2012 and more than half of its full-year 2014 NPK imports, according to GTIS data.
In January, Russia supplied 38,455 mt, or 97% of the total import volume, a figure which is more than Russia provided in the whole of 2014.
In the full year 2014, India only imported 65,286 mt of NPKs, with more than half coming from Russia. The high January imports may be a sign that India could signal a return to the levels of yearly NPK imports seen between 2010 and 2012.
NPK production in India between April 2014 and February is up by 13% at 7.3 million mt as DAP producers switched to NPKs in the face of higher phosphoric acid prices.
India: MFL receives two offers in potash tender
Indian fertilizer producer MFL has received two offers in its tender for 15,000 mt with a closing date of April 2.
The company received an offer from IPL at $324/mt CFR and one from Uzagro at $330/mt CFR both with 180 days credit. MFL is likely to award the tender to IPL in the next couple of days.
Representatives in the country are currently in negotiations over a new contract deal for 2015. The current price is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit and the IPL/Uzagro offers should help suppliers achieve a price increase.
The tender is for delivery in April or May at Chennai port.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Australia: Wildhorse Energy to acquire Australia Salt Lake Potash
AIM and ASX listed Wildhorse Energy has agreed to acquire Australia Salt Lake Potash and its two SOP/SOPM exploration projects in Western Australia.
ASLP's Lake Wells and Lake Ballard projects are currently in the exploration stage with the preparation of an initial resource estimate planned for the coming months.
Wildhorse is set to acquire 100% of ASLP's shares, subject to approval by Wildhorse shareholders, via the issuance of 15 million Wildhorse shares at completion and a further 22.5 million performance shares if various performance conditions are met in the future.
Wildhorse said the acquisition has "excellent potential" to produce SOP for domestic and international markets.
Upon completion of the deal, Wildhorse plans to undertake further drilling and testwork in order to move towards a scoping study for the site. Wildhorse may also provide ASLP with a limited loan facility in order to conduct some exploration work.
The company currently holds four uranium exploration sites in Hungary and a uranium/vanadium project in the US. It is carrying out a restructuring plan to cease all activities in Europe and has been seeking new business opportunities for some time.
China: Domestic MOP prices expected to keep falling
The Chinese domestic standard MOP price remains stable this week at RMB 2,050-2,200/mt FCA but sources continue to expect port warehouse prices to continue their fall towards the new $315/mt CFR contract price.
Prices are quoted at RMB 2,050 ($331)/mt for red standard potash in Northern China but in the south red standard prices remain around RMB 2,100/mt due to limited fresh arrivals.
White standard potash prices are seen around RMB 2,150/mt and 62% K2O product is quoted at RMB 2,200/mt.
QSL is expected to adjust its price list soon with big sales agents and distributers said to be selling standard crystal MOP from QSL at RMB 2,100/mt CPT, an RMB 60/mt fall on QSL's price at the start of this year.
Large volumes are said to be coming into the country now following the new contract agreements while small to medium level potash producers are now restarting following winter maintenance. As a result supply is building and there are expectations that the domestic price could fall towards as low as RMB 2,030/mt FCA, leaving very little margin for importers.
Southeast Asia: Spot prices still flat amid price push
Malaysian potash prices have been quoted stable this week as suppliers attempt to push up prices after settling the Chinese contract.
Malaysian standard MOP is being quoted at $315-325/mt CFR with only small quantities being booked and little buying interest in the country.
Some suppliers recently said they were looking to increase prices towards the $330/mt CFR level in Malaysia and will hope these prices can be achieved in the May tender season. Some importers have noted more interest in prices above $315/mt CFR than in recent weeks.
In Indonesia, the recent Sinar Mas tender for 100,000 mt is believed to have been extended but offers were made around $335/mt CFR. In addition, there are rumours that a significant tender for H2 delivery as high as 500,000 mt is soon to be announced by Petrokimia Gresik.
In Vietnam, prices remain quoted at $340-345/mt CFR with only small deals. As a result, prices in Southeast Asia have increased to $320-345/mt CFR from $315-345/mt CFR last week.
Indonesia: NPK imports double in 2014
Indonesia imported 423,187 mt of NPKs in 2014, almost doubling its full-year figures from 2013 and the country's highest yearly imports since 2008, according to GTIS.
NPK demand in Indonesia is steadily growing, partly to feed rising palm oil production.
The country imported more than 50% of the NPK volumes from Malaysia, while 35%came from Norway.
Taiwan: Imports over 40,000 mt of MOP in January
Taiwan imported 42,725 mt of potash in January, a 22% year-on-year fall, but still high levels compared to the country's normal average January imports, according to GTIS data.
The country imported 24,000 mt from APC and 15,000 mt from Canpotex in January. APC provided less than 15,000 mt of potash to Taiwan in the whole of both 2014 and 2013.
Taiwan imported 387,992 mt of potash in 2014, a 37% increase on the previous year and its highest yearly potash imports on record.
Indonesia: Potash imports reach 2.9 million mt in 2014
In the full year 2014, Indonesia imported 2.9 million mt of potash, a 29% increase on the previous year and the largest yearly imports since 2011, according to GTIS.
The country imported 49% of the volumes, or 1.4 million mt, from Canpotex, which increased its yearly sales to Indonesia by roughly 70,000 mt. But Canpotex lost around 10% of its market share.
BPC more than doubled its sales volumes to 624,233 mt and Uralkali quadrupled its Indonesian sales to 574,711 mt.
APC more than halved Indonesian sales to 170,285 mt and the country imported 95,033 mt from K+S.
In December, Indonesia imported 257,599 mt of potash, more than double its December 2013 figures with in excess of 50% imported from Canpotex.
China: APC signs new sales contract
Jordanian producer Arab Potash Company has reached a deal with Sinochem Fertilizer Macao Commercial Offshore to supply 600,000 mt of potash to China in 2015.
The figures are firm tonnage and the deal also includes optional quantities, which are not reported.
The terms of the deal "reflect the current market prices," according to APC, which is likely to mean that they were signed at $315/mt CFR.
Belarusian producer BPC recently negotiated a $10/mt increase on the previous $305/mt CFR Chinese contract, undercutting plans by Canpotex and Uralkali to achieve a larger increase.
BPC signed firm contracts for 1.7 million mt of potash and Canpotex for 1.8 million mt last week, with Uralkali and ICL likely to sign contracts this week.
The APC deal demonstrates a partnership between APC and Sinochem Macao, which has existed since the early 1980s. In 2013, the two companies signed an agreement making Sinochem Macao the exclusive channel for all APC sales of MOP to China between 2014 and 2016.
SULPHUR
ANALYSIS
Global sulphur sentiment soft as activity lacking
Sentiment in global sulphur markets remained soft, with a lack of demand and further price declines expected.
Aramco Trading is expected to confirm its May price next week, and market participants expect a dramatic decline from its April level of $165/mt FOB.
Chinese domestic prices fell over the course of the week, and counters to international offers similarly plunged. Market activity was low, and most expect some further price declines over the coming weeks. The price falls have come despite persistently low port inventories, demonstrating a decoupling of the historical relationship between the two market indicators. Market participants disagree as to how far away the market floor price may be.
Indian demand was also lacking, with a range of phosphate players undergoing or soon to undergo maintenance and price ideas unchanged.
Contract negotiations continued in different regions.
On European Q2 sulphur contracts, buyers have been seeking price declines of $10-15/mt while sellers have been seeking price increases of $10-15/mt. Sources away from negotiations believe that a rollover is the most likely outcome.
Contracts aimed at Q2 volumes to North Africa were not yet settled by either Russian or Middle Eastern sellers. Expectations range from a drop of $5/mt to one of more than $15/mt from the Q1 level of $160- 165/mt CFR. Recent spot business to Morocco has been conducted at $140-142/mt CFR from the Middle East and Mediterranean.
Meanwhile, full-year trade data showed that Moroccan imports climbed 18% or around 700,000 mt in 2015, with Russia, the US and Kuwait increasing their market share while Saudi Arabia and Spain saw their share decrease.
The Vancouver FOB spot assessment was reduced based on notional netback levels, as previous FOB offer prices were far from anything that could be achieved in current spot markets anywhere in the world.
Brazilian spot prices were also assessed lower on market feedback, though the outcome of Anglo American’s recent tender was unclear.
On the buy side, IJC issued a tender for 40,000 mt and Lafchemco issued a tender for 25,000 mt. On the sell side, Tasweeq issued its latest 35,000 mt tender.
Highlights of the week:
∙Chinese prices fall further
∙Europe Q2 talks drag on
∙North African Q2 talks yet to conclude but decline expected
∙Moroccan 2014 imports up 700,000 mt
∙Vancouver FOB spot assessment reduced to $140-150/mt
∙IJC tenders for 40,000 mt for May import
∙Lafchemco tenders for 25,000 mt for May import
∙Tasweeq issues latest 35,000 mt export tender


NORTH AMERICA
Canada: Vancouver FOB levels assessed lower on notional netbacks but indications scarce
Vancouver FOB prices were assessed considerably lower week on week based on international CFR prices, although firm indications could not be obtained.
Over recent weeks, it has been reported that sellers were not considering bids below $170/mt FOB. But with this FOB price above even CFR prices available in any region, it is clear that this would be an unrealistic expectation.
Pending further confirmation of price levels, values have been assessed at an indicative $140-150/mt FOB Vancouver, though most believe that sellers would in fact have to offer below $140/mt FOB to move volumes given current prices elsewhere.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Prices inch down but market quiet
Brazilian prices were assessed lower this week at $160-165/mt CFR, as the upper end of the previous assessment was not reflective of market levels.
No details could be obtained on Anglo American’s most recent tender for 37,000 mt, and market sources were not clear whether it had in fact been awarded.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Q2 contracts yet to settle
Russian contracts for Q2 have yet to settle, although sources say that buyers and sellers are getting closer to an agreement.
Some market participants away from negotiations believe that a decline from Q1 settlements is likely, but sellers did not want to discuss possible price movements prior to settlement.
EUROPE
Europe: Contracts yet to settle
No conclusion was yet reported on European sulphur contracts, as buyers and sellers differed in their view of the market situation.
Buyers have been seeking price declines of $10-15/mt based on weak demand and price falls elsewhere, while sellers have been seeking price increases of $10-15/mt based on tight availability resulting from a range of refinery turnarounds.
Sources away from negotiations believe that a rollover is the most likely outcome.
Mediterranean: Sulphur market stable
The Mediterranean sulphur market was little changed on the week, and prices remained pegged at $135- 140/mt CFR.
Sources reported that tight availability as a result of the Priolo maintenance has led to firm domestic demand in Italy.
Egyptian business was also reported in the $135-140/mt CFR range.
Sources reported that container freight rates in the region were falling.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Qatar: Tasweeq issues latest 35,000 mt tender
Tasweeq issued its latest export tender for 35,000 mt.
The tender closes April 21.
Morocco: Contracts expected lower; spot in low $140s/mt CFR
North African sulphur contracts for Q2 have yet to settle, but a decrease from the Q2 levels of $160-165/mt CFR seems all but certain at this stage.
Expectations ranged from a drop of $5/mt to one of more than $15/mt.
Recent spot business to Morocco has been conducted at $140-142/mt CFR from the Middle East and Mediterranean.
Saudi Arabia: Aramco price expected next week
Aramco Trading is expected to confirm its May price next week, and market participants expect a dramatic decline.
The seller’s April price was $165/mt FOB, which is well above what is achievable on current CFR prices, and prices are expected to remain weak and likely decline further in coming weeks.
Last week, Tasweeq announced its QSP for April at $145/mt FOB, down $19/mt from March, and Adnoc announced its OSP for April at $140/mt FOB, representing a $35/mt fall.
Jordan: IJC tenders for 40,000 mt
IJC issued a tender for 40,000 mt for arrival at Aqaba May 15-20.
The tender closes on 13 April.
Morocco: Sulphur imports up 38% in 2014
Morocco’s 2014 sulphur imports were up 18% on the previous year at 4.5 million mt as December imports climbed 38% year on year to 393,622 mt.
Russia supplied 1.92 million mt of the 2014 tonnes, with its market share climbing to 42.6% from 38.65%.
Other key sources of imports were the UAE, which supplied 842,637 mt, Poland, which supplied 404,623 mt, and the US, which supplied 330,586 mt. The US volume was up from 183,543 mt in 2013, with its share increasing to 7.34% from 4.82%. Spain saw its share decrease to 4.32% from 5.81% as it supplied 194,577 mt in 2014.
Saudi Arabia’s share also declined to 6.42% from 8.89% as Morocco’s imports from the country decreased to 289,070 mt from 338,539 mt. Imports from Kuwait almost tripled to 156,164 mt from 54,517 mt.
In 2015, Moroccan sulphur demand is expected to decrease slightly as OCP refocuses operations towards the production of NPKs for the African market.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Prices unchanged but activity lacking
Price ideas for sulphur in India remained in the $160s/mt CFR, with no new spot business reported.
Turnarounds at buyers have left them under less pressure to buy. IFFCO and CIL have both begun maintenances that will run until mid-to-late April, and PPL will undergo a shutdown from April 20.
RCF’s 5,000 mt, which was extended to March 10 from March 4, was awarded to Managlore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited at INR 10,240/mt EXW.

www.crugroup.comWeekly Overview Report | 79
India: January sulphur imports inch up
India's January imports of sulphur increased 3% year on year to 152,561 mt.
Most of the tonnes came from the Middle East, with 55,424 mt from Saudi Arabia, 53,830 mt from Qatar, 16,587 mt from Bahrain, and 13,200 mt from the UAE.
In addition, Japan supplied 12,032 mt.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Vietnam: Lafchemco tenders for 25,000 mt
Lafchemco issued a tender for 25,000 mt sulphur shipment up to early May.
The tender closes April 14.
Current price ideas to Vietnam are in the low-to-mid-$160s/mt CFR.
China: Domestic prices fall further despite low port inventories
Prices in the domestic Chinese market dropped further as spot activity remained limited.
Quotes in Eastern China for granular product were around RMB 1,180/mt FCA at ports. Although quotes at Fangcheng were relatively high at RMB 1,240-1,260/mt FCA, there was not much interest from buyers at these prices.
The price falls have continued despite continuing low levels of port inventories, which were around 0.95 million mt.
Currently, the fertilizer industry is the only sector with strong demand, while other sectors including fluoric acid and caprolactam offered limited demand as their production rates were low.
Some regions, particularly Hubei, also struggled with strong competition from smelter acid, which offered prices that were low and negotiable.
Sulphur future contracts on the commodity exchange in Jiangsu have May prices at RMB 1,150/mt FCA.
Import prices have not been falling as rapidly as domestic port prices over the past week. The discussed range was $150-160/mt CFR, but no spot deals were confirmed in this range, and some sources said that achievable prices were more likely in the $140s/mt CFR.
However, large phosphate producers have reportedly been buying large quantities of imported product, and it is believed that they are paying prices close to the equivalents of FOB levels quoted by major international producers.
Prices for molten product were no longer well below those of granular sulphur, as their prices have not fallen as much.
However, crushed lump deals were confirmed at $130-135/mt CFR.
Sinopec’s Puguang had around 18,000 mt at Wenzhou, but as its price of RMB 1,200/mt FCA was no longer below prices available from other sellers, its business was slower. Its stock at plant was around 80,000 mt, with prices RMB 1,100/mt EXW, further demonstrating slow consumption.
Although phosphate producers can afford current sulphur prices, it suits them to see further price declines. Some turnarounds at large phosphate producers are planned for April and May, which may also hurt sulphur demand, although traders believe that where possible the companies will shorten or delay turnarounds to take advantage of phosphate export demand.
SULPHURIC ACID
ANALYSIS
Sulphuric acid prices stable with little new business
Sulphuric acid prices remained stable across the globe this week, as there was little new spot activity reported.
In Europe, the FOB spot assessment was unchanged. Market players awaited the conclusion of a 15,000 mt enquiry from Petrobras, while the previously reported 36,000 mt enquiry from Yara was believed to be a market testing exercise that has not so far resulted in any firm business.
Other spot demand for European product was limited; as Moroccan spot demand remained slow given weaker sulphur prices and somewhat lower acid requirements, and it is expected that the country will not be as strong a source of demand as it has been in recent months, though it is expected to continue importing large volumes. Full-year trade data showed that Moroccan imports had climbed by two thirds from 2013, with more than 70% of this volume from Spain, Bulgaria and Belgium.
US February imports climbed 13% on the year, with high volumes from European exporters.
European contracts for Q2 were mostly settled at a rollover from Q1, in line with expectations.
In Asia, the FOB spot assessment was also unchanged, with no new business reported.
Indian demand remains a key source of market support, but sources wondered how sustainable the demand is, particularly given a range of phosphate plant turnarounds and the expectation of somewhat lower prices in coming months when Asian smelter turnarounds conclude.
Chilean spot demand also remains lacklustre, and some fear that recent floods may have dented hopes for a resurgence. Trade data showed that Chile’s February exports were up 20% year on year, with recently- reported Mexican sales to the country showing up in the figures. Meanwhile, Patache port is now closed to sulphuric acid though still open to sulphur. Buyers in the northern region of the country will therefore be facing an increase of around $60/mt on their freight costs for imported acid, as they will have to move product from Mejillones.
Highlights of the week:
∙Petrobras seeking 15,000 mt for import
∙Global FOB assessments stable
∙Moroccan imports up by two thirds in 2014
∙European Q2 contracts settle unchanged
∙US February imports climb with strong European volumes
∙Chilean February imports up 20%
∙Patache close to sulphuric acid bringing up northern Chile import prices
Base Metals
Base metals again showed slight gains over the week, although movements were mixed. Uncertainty over possible rate increases by the Fed led to a weaker dollar, providing some support to commodity prices. LME copper was up to $6,050/mt for cash.
DAP & Sulphur
US Gulf sulphuric acid pricing likely will be affected by any Q2 liquid sulphur settlement between US Gulf phosphate producers Mosaic and PotashCorp and their suppliers in coming weeks, but so far there is precious little chatter about the state of those negotiations. The falling price of DAP in the US in theory could lead to lower output from the aforementioned phosphate producers, which in turn might lead them to market some of their own sulphuric acid, but this is only speculation at this stage.
Global market sentiment for sulphur remained soft, with most expecting further price falls over coming weeks. Market activity was limited with little demand in any region to offer support. The expected announcement of Aramco's May price next week is eagerly awaited by market watchers, with a large drop expected from its April level.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices inched up further this week, continuing their recent recovery and reaching $1,670- 1,700/mt CFR China. Prices may gain further support after benzene prices surged following an explosion at the Dragon Aromatics plant in China.
MARKETS
NORTH AMERICA
Canada: February sulphuric acid exports decline 16.6%
Canada's February exports of sulphuric acid declined 16.6% year on year to 140,148 mt.
As is typical, effectively all of the exports went to the US.

US: February imports climb as European volumes high
US imports of sulphuric acid for February were up 13% year on year to 275,985 mt.
Canada was the source of the majority of February tonnes, supplying 140,126 mt. This was followed by Mexico, which supplied 56,143 mt.
European countries were the source of more acid imports than usual, with 24,038 mt from Germany, 19,315 mt from Finland, 18,927 mt from Sweden, and 17,001 mt from Poland.
This marks the highest monthly volume from Germany since June 2011, from Finland since June 2009, and from Poland since April 2014.

CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Petrobras seeking 15,000 mt
Petrobras is seeking 15,000 mt of sulphur, though a deal had not yet been concluded by press time.
Meanwhile, Yara’s requirement for two lots of 18,000 mt led to some confusion, as many in the market believed that the buyer was merely testing the market and it was not a firm enquiry.
Opinion was split as to whether Brazilian prices will climb into the $90s/mt CFR or remain in the $80s/mt CFR.
Chile: February imports climb 20%; Patache closed to acid
Chile’s sulphuric acid imports for February climbed 20% year on year to 236,120 mt, their highest monthly volume since April 2014.
Peru supplied 106,994 mt of the February volumes, with 50,564 mt from Japan, 36,720 mt from Mexico, 22,502 mt from South Korea, and 19,135 mt from Spain.
The Mexican tonnes represent the largest volume imported from the country by Chile since October 2011.
As recently reported, Mexico has become a surprising source of marginal supply; with product from both the Boleo mine and Grupo Mexico satisfying Latin American demand. By mid-March this year, Boleo had reportedly sold four parcels of around 19,000 mt each, with three to Chile and one to Brazil.
Meanwhile, Patache port is now closed to sulphuric acid though still open to sulphur. Buyers in the northern region of the country will therefore be facing an increase of around $60/mt on their freight costs for imported acid, as they will have to move product from Mejillones.
EUROPE
Europe: Spot assessment unchanged as new business awaited
European spot export prices were assessed unchanged at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe as most market participants agreed with the range and there was no new business to suggest that FOB levels had changed.
However, some sources argued that the current market tightness would mean that higher prices would be more representative of what would be achievable, with prices as high as $40/mt FOB suggested.
Europe: Q2 contracts mostly settled at rollovers
European contracts for sulphuric acid are mostly settled, with the majority of contracts a rollover from Q1 levels.
Some small increases were achieved on truck contracts, but bulk contracts were mostly unchanged.
This was in line with expectations.
The assessed range therefore remains €57-80/mt CFR Northwest Europe.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: Sulphuric acid spot activity lacking
No new spot business to Morocco has been reported recently.
Traders say that OCP has enquired after product, but has not found current spot price ideas into the $60s/mt CFR sufficiently attractive, as it is receiving contract volumes at prices well below this and is also benefitting from falling sulphur prices.
The buyer has indicated that it will have a much lower spot acid requirement over the coming months, as its new 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit is expected to be brought onstream in April. While the company’s phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus sulphuric acid available for use in OCP's other facilities.
Morocco: Sulphuric acid imports jump 66% in 2014
Morocco's imports of sulphuric acid in 2014 climbed 66% from the previous year to 889,809 mt, trade data show, as December imports climbed 48% year on year to 63,947 mt.
However, the breakdown suggests that December imports were exactly the same volume as in November from India (21,918 mt), Belgium (15,043 mt), and Italy (8,198 mt), though the figure for imports from Spain climbed to 18,785 mt from 15,749 mt.
Over the course of 2014, Spain was the largest source of Morocco’s sulphuric acid imports, supplying 36%, while Bulgaria supplied 26% and Belgium 10%.
Morocco has continued to be an important source of demand so far this year, but it is likely to reduce its sulphuric acid market activity in the coming months. OCP’s new 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit is expected to be brought onstream in April. While the company’s phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus sulphuric acid available for use in OCP’s other facilities.

INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Price ideas unchanged but activity limited
Indian prices remained pegged in the $70s/mt CFR, but no new business was confirmed and market participants questioned whether current Indian spot demand for sulphuric acid was sustainable.
Sources reported that Indian buyers continue to enquire after product, but no spot import deals were reported.
Domestic SSP players are buying acid in the range of INR 4,000-5,000/mt ($65-80/mt) from domestic suppliers.
Demand from P&K; players is likely to be low as turnarounds at buyers leave them under less pressure to buy. IFFCO and CIL have both begun maintenances that will run until mid-to-late April, and PPL will undergo a shutdown from April 20.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: Spot demand limited to small volumes
Southeast Asian spot demand remains predominantly for small lots of 3,000-4,000 mt, according to market sources.
It is therefore of minimal interest to traders, and is unlikely to boost market spot prices from their current level.
Japan/South Korea: FOB prices stable but availability tight
East Asian FOB prices remained assessed at $17-22/mt FOB Japan/South Korea.
No new firm price indications were reported, and most market participants believed that the current assessment was reflective of market levels.
But tight availability meant that those with prompt requirements might need to source more expensive sulphur-burnt product from elsewhere, as has happened in recent weeks.
Indeed, recent spot business from China to India at close to $80/mt CFR indicates that much higher netbacks could be achievable on East Asian acid.
Philippines: PASAR yet to begin maintenance
Glencore’s PASAR smelter has not yet started its maintenance, sources said.
It is still expected to undergo a turnaround for much of Q2 in order integrate a capacity expansion.
China: Sulphuric acid prices stable
Sulphuric acid prices in China were relatively stable despite falls in sulphur.
Sulphur burners are still struggling to compete with smelter acid, despite lower sulphur prices. But they, and pyrite-based producers, have been helped by revenue from sales of steam created during the production process.
However, in Hubei province sources reported that prices for steam had dropped to RMB 50-70/mt, making it more difficult for sulphur- and pyrite-based producers to compete with smelters.
Meanwhile, demand from non-fertilizer sectors remains weak, as industrial buyers are running at low rates.
Demand for imported sulphuric acid was therefore also relatively low, with buyers not providing the same level of support to the spot market that they did in previous years, though they continue to take high import volumes from South Korean smelters.
NPKS
MARKETS
EUROPE
Europe: Weak levels of NPK activity
NPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months, with only small deals being made despite being deep into normal spring buying season.
Weak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks and apprehension on the farmers' buying side have all impacted NPK demand and even the reduced prices are failing to attract buyers.
Indications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively. Triple 15 offers are being made as low as $325/mt FOB, according to sources, but buyers are either disinterested or are bidding significantly lower.
With OCP bringing on its new 1 million mt integrated granulation plant this month, Russian NP/NPK business will become ever more vulnerable to competition from Morocco, particularly in Africa.
We have already begun to see increased Russian (PhosAgro and Acron) activity in the Indian market, a market that Russian producers have foregone in the last two years.

MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Kenya: KTDA awards 70,000 mt NPK tender
The Kenya Tea Development Agency awarded its annual tender for about 70,000 mt NPK 26-5-5 to Mekatrade after receiving four offers.
Singapore-based Mekatrade will deliver product from Uralchem at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.
Yara submitted the highest offer at $375/mt CFR. Ameropa came in at $367 CFR and a third trader offered at $368/mt CFR.
The volumes will be delivered in two shipments, with the first in July and the second a month later, an official at KTDA told Fertilizer Week. A production period of 28 days is required once the letter of credit has been issued.
The original tender was for 69,000 mt.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: January NPK imports at 2-year high
India imported 39,525 mt of NPKs in January, its largest January figures since 2012 and more than half of its full-year 2014 NPK imports, according to GTIS data.
In January, Russia supplied 38,455 mt, or 97% of the total import volume, a figure which is more than Russia provided in the whole of 2014.
In the full year 2014, India only imported 65,286 mt of NPKs, with more than half coming from Russia. The high January imports may be a sign that India could signal a return to the levels of yearly NPK imports seen between 2010 and 2012.
NPK production in India between April 2014 and February is up by 13% at 7.3 million mt as DAP producers switched to NPKs in the face of higher phosphoric acid prices.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Indonesia: NPK imports double in 2014
Indonesia imported 423,187 mt of NPKs in 2014, almost doubling its full-year figures from 2013 and the country's highest yearly imports since 2008, according to GTIS.
NPK demand in Indonesia is steadily growing, partly to feed rising palm oil production.
The country imported more than 50% of the NPK volumes from Malaysia, while 35%came from Norway.
