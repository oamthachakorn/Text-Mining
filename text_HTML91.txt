ANALYSIS
Prices continue inching upwards
Global spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards March, with higher indications from the Middle East and China. Brazilian prices also demonstrated increases, albeit limited.
Tasweeq’s latest 35,000 mt tender, which closed on June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB, though this has yet to be confirmed.
Iran’s IGCC sold 30,000 mt of crushed lump product at $139/mt FOB, according to sources, and will close a tender for 30,000 mt of granular material June 22.
Prices in China increased for domestic sales at port and for international business, with one trade as high as $164.50/mt CFR. Port inventories remained low, while several phosphate and NPK producers reported good stock levels.
FACT’s recent 15-25,000 mt tender was awarded at $165/mt CFR, disproving some buyers’ prices ideas as low as $155/mt CFR.
Anglo American’s latest 37,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded at $160/mt CFR, though some had heard
$155/mt CFR. At either price, the award was above Anglo’s previous tender, and still within recent weeks’
assessed levels of $150-160/mt CFR.
The higher levels are in line with Fertilizer Week forecasts for slight increases in June and July following dramatic drops in previous weeks, as buyers held off purchasing as they awaited the bottom of the market. Market participants now report tight spot availability from Middle Eastern sellers, meaning those needing to obtain stock are having to bid slightly higher.
However, concerns persist over downstream phosphate demand, and it is not believed that fundamentals can support considerable price increases in sulphur.
Meanwhile, OCP remains out of the spot market, and is reportedly covered for requirements to late August.
Prices in some Mediterranean regions were pegged slightly higher, while elsewhere they were stable.
Negotiations for Q3 contracts across the globe are expected to have begun by next week. North African negotiations are yet to commence, with limited expectations expressed, though both sides are likely to push for price movements in the direction suited to them.
Brazilian buyers have indicated that they will resist any Q3 increases, and one buyer suggested they may increase their proportion of spot purchases talks result in an increase. European talks also had yet to formally commence, though no great change is expected in either direction.
Highlights of the week:
∙Tasweeq awards tender in mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB
∙Chinese business heard up to mid-$160s/mt CFR
∙Iran's IGCC sells crushed lump in high $130s/mt FOB
∙FACT tender awarded at $165/mt CFR
∙Latest Anglo tender heard at $155-160/mt CFR
∙OCP requirements met to late August
∙Q3 talks in various regions to commence over coming week
MARKETS
SULPHUR
NORTH AMERICA
Canada: Vancouver FOB sulphur slightly higher
Prices for spot exports of sulphur from Canada were assessed slightly higher, with the range extending to $130-140/mt FOB Vancouver from $130-135/mt FOB.
However, no firm deals were confirmed at the higher levels, but market participants suggested that business had already been concluded in the high $130s/mt FOB, and price increases elsewhere suggest that levels up to $140/mt FOB should be achievable.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Buyers plan to resist any Q3 increases
Brazilian buyers plan to resist increases on Q3 sulphur contracts, arguing that demand is unchanged while availability should be increasing in Q3.
Buyers expect nothing above Q2 levels of around $130-135/mt FOB US and $140/mt FOB Middle East
One buyer suggested they may do an increased proportion of purchasing on a spot basis if contract negotiations prove too difficult.
Meanwhile, Anglo American’s latest 37,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded this week at around $160/mt CFR, though other sources pegged the number as low as $155/mt CFR.
This suggests Brazilian spot levels remain in the $155-160/mt CFR range, where they have been assessed for several weeks. However, prices at the lower end of this range are unlikely to be achievable in the current market.
Anglo American was set to receive 38,850 mt from Ust Luga via Trammo on the Kouyou at the Termag Terminal of Rio Grande June 18, having previously received 36,489 mt from Corpu Christy via Koch May 26.
Vale was set to receive several cargoes. Trammo was sending 33,500 mt from Ust Luga on the Vipava with and ETA of June 23, having sent 33,651 mt on the Mandarin Dalian for arrival June 12.
Oxbow was sending 31,500 mt on the Pacific Calm from Louisiana for arrival June 30, having previously sent 38,662 mt from Beaumont on the Orange River for arrival May 23.
Shell was sending 38,500 mt on the Ocean Eternity from Beaumont for arrival July 10, while KPC was sending 31,500 mt on the RM Dynasty from Shuaiba to arrive July 17.
All of the above arrivals are for Tiplam at Rio Grande.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Q3 talks yet to commence
Suppliers of Russian sulphur have not yet begun discussions for Q3 contracts with their consumers.
Talks are expected to commence later this week or early next week.
Meanwhile, suppliers say that their current loadings of product are going well.
EUROPE
Mediterranean: Sulphur prices reported stable to higher
Mediterranean sulphur prices remain mostly stable, although there were further signs of increases in some regions.
One trader reported business in Egypt around $140/mt CFR, but with payment terms of six months.
The same trader reported strong competition in Turkey from Greek and Romanian supply.
Another trader reportedly obtained Libyan material in the low $130s/mt FOB and was expected to seek the mid-$140s/mt CFR in the Med region, but market players were not sure whether this would be achievable.
However, crushed lump product was reported sold in the high $130s/mt CFR Mediterranean.
Europe: Views differ on expected Q3 settlements
Opinions differed on the likely outcome for European Q3 sulphur contracts, although market players overall do not expect any great change.
Negotiations are expected to begin later this week.
Sellers hope to recover some Q2 decreases, arguing that the euro/dollar exchange rate is not as unfavourable for buyers as it as when Q2 levels were agreed. Relatively positive current global sentiment in sulphur markets will likely help them.
But some buyers argue that further decreases are necessary, and point to good availability of product.
Settlements for Q2 ranged from a rollover to a decrease of $5/mt or less, but the assessed settlement range for barge/railcar contracts remained $158-170/mt CFR, as no settlements were reported outside of this range. However, it is likely that very few contracts were settled at the upper end of this range. The main reason for the reductions was weakness in the euro relative to the dollar, which had left European buyers paying more for their contracts in euro terms.
Market participants are hopeful that talks will not drag on as long as Q2 discussions did.
Elsewhere, Neste’s refinery in Porvoo, Finland, this week restarted production following a scheduled maintenance that began in April. It was the largest turnaround in the refinery's history.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Iran: IGCC sells crushed at $139/mt FOB
Iran’s IGCC awarded a 30,000 mt tender of crushed lump sulphur to a Chinese trader at $139/mt FOB, according to market sources.
The seller will reportedly close a 30,000 mt tender for granular product on June 22.
Qatar: Latest Tasweeq tender mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB
Tasweeq’s latest 35,000 mt tender, which closed June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB, though no firm conclusion was confirmed.
Traders contacted by Fertilizer Week said they bid below $146/mt FOB but were not successful.
Some suggested prices may be even higher.
The seller's last tender closed on May 19 and was awarded in the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB.
Tasweeq's posted selling price for June volumes is $141/mt FOB, while recent spot sales from the Middle East have been reported in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB.
Morocco: Q3 talks in early stages; OCP out of spot
Negotiations for Q3 Moroccan sulphur contracts are still in their early stages, and parties are reluctant to disclose expected settlements at this point.
Meanwhile, OCP remains out of the spot market, as the buyer is reportedly fully covered till the end of August.
Elsewhere, a vessel was sought to move 20,000 mt of granular sulphur from the Black Sea port of Poti to either Jorf Lasfar or Safi.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: FACT tender awarded at $165/mt CFR
FACT’s June 10 tender for 15-25,000 mt sulphur for delivery to Cochin July 6-10 was awarded to Swiss Singapore at $165/mt CFR, disproving some buyer price ideas of $155-160/mt CFR.
Recent business to CIL was also reported in the mid-$160s/mt CFR.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Prices continue gradual uptick
Chinese prices climbed further this week, although market action was fairly limited on a lack of speculative activity. Most buying was for downstream users.
Spot price at ports rose to RMB 1,240-1,260/mt FCA, up RMB 20/mt on the week.
Port inventories dropped to around 900,000 mt but rebounded to 930,000 mt by June 18.
International offers were in the $160s/mt CFR, being driven up by reported relatively tight availability of MIddle Eastern product.
Some reported bids from Chinese buyers in the low-mid-$160s/mt CFR and one trader said they had concluded a sale of 35,000 mt ex-Middle East at $164.50/mt CFR this week.
Crushed lump in some cases was close to $150/mt CFR, but some reported crushed lump prices still as low as $138/mt CFR.
Among domestic producers, Sinopec’s Puguang was quoting RMB 1,200/mt FCA at Wenzhou port and RMB 1,190/mt EXW. Its inventory levels are 15,000 mt at port and 20,000 mt at plant, indicating little pressure on pricing.
Some large phosphate & NPK producers in Hubei said they built stock when offers were in the low $150s/mt CFR and some paid in the low $130s/mt CFR for lump product. Therefore, although port inventories declined, the stock levels in plants increased in some cases.
Elsewhere, there was a gathering of sulphur traders in Nanjing on June 18, hosted by Bohai Commodity Exchange. The exchange, based in Tianjin in Northern China, has provided an electronic platform for spot trading of sulphur from July 2013. It is now encouraging major sulphur importers and large phosphate producers to transact on the platform.
