ANALYSIS
Market direction unclear as some prices firm
A slight firming in ammonia prices is noted on a perceived tightening of supply east and west of Suez. Future price direction remains unclear and a number of market participants are holding off from concluding deals in the meantime.
In anticipation of further purchases by Koch in the Black Sea and Baltic for July lifting, Yara has sought cover for 20,000 mt from several Baltic suppliers at an even $400/mt FOB, up $10/mt on the previous index. This was in response to a recent ammonia plant fire at Yara’s Brunsbüttel facility in Germany which affected its own supply chain. The impact of the fire remains unclear.
Black Sea activity proved calmer with no new cargoes believed traded. Netbacks declined to the mid
$370s/mt FOB in recent sales by Trammo into Turkey and Morocco with downward price pressure from both buying nations forecast to continue. OCP is still pushing for values at a $350/mt FOB Yuzhnny equivalent although Black Sea suppliers are so far refusing to accept the demands for lower prices.
Suppliers east of Suez have maintained upward price pressure with the presumed start-up the Safco V granular urea plant at the end of June certain to reduce available merchant ammonia volumes. As yet the vast majority of Asian buyers have resisted such price attempts, with South Korean buyers still claiming no interest in additional cargoes outside contract volumes until the end of July at the earliest.
South east Asian values have already noted a $11/mt uptick to $448/mt CFR following CJ Indonesia’s reported tender award to Petrokimia Gresik. This is likely a reaction to the high-priced 20,000 mt Kaltim sale to Mitsui at $437.50 FOB last week. It is suggested this cargo may be used against a reported sale to Orica around $500/mt CFR for first half July delivery.
Indian ammonia demand will be the key to future price development east of Suez. Satisfactory monsoon rainfall is being recorded for June but drier conditions in July could prompt a build-up of DAP inventories, possibly lowering ammonia demand. Negotiations on Q3 phosphoric acid prices are on-going.
In the US Gulf, CF is receiving ammonia through Yara that is enabling it to begin test runs on it new urea train at Donaldsonville Louisiana. That plant will run on imported ammonia until first half 2016 when the planned ammonia unit at the site comes on line.
Negotiations on the Tampa July price tag are yet to begin in earnest as both parties wait for the market direction to become clearer. Various sources have mooted a rollover from June’s $450/mt CFR Tampa price tag.
Fill offers for ammonia to be delivered ahead of the fall application season in inland US reported earlier this week by Fertilizer Week were fairly aggressive at around $540/st FOB in the Midwest from a limited number of suppliers. The pricing suggests suppliers have seen greater than normal carryover from the spring season.
Highlights of the week:
∙Koch still seeking Black Sea and Baltic cargoes
∙Trammo sells to Petkim in low $400/mt CFR
∙OCP buys 25,000 mt from Trammo in low $400s/mt CFR
∙Australia's Orica buys 19,000 mt from a trader around $500/mt CFR
∙CJ Indonesia awards tender to Petrokimia Gresik at $448/mt CFR
∙July Tampa price negotiations to start soon
Short term outlook
Furture price direction remains unclear with a combination of price increases and declines noted east and west of Suez.
Ammonia versus DAP
DAP production remains suspended at GCT's Gabes plant as rock supplies are subject to further disruptions, limiting ammonia imports. For July OCP is expected to place greater emphasis on MAP/DAP production over NPKs to cover commitments in Brazil and Europe although demand in Brazil remains extremely
subdued. Nevertheless, OCP will be hoping to balance granulation with steady Indian phosacid shipments but acid volumes will depend on the eventual price settled for Q3. Negotiations for this are ongoing.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices remain stable for the fifth consecutive week at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China, as sulphur and ammonia prices were overall fairly stable and expectations of oversupply have been tempered slightly in recent months.
MARKETS
AMMONIA
NORTH AMERICA
Tampa: July pricing focus of market attention
Mosaic is expected to fight hard for a further cut in the Tampa ammonia price tag for its July deliveries. Market watchers are predicting that flat pricing from the June agreement of $450/mt CFR may be the best Yara can hope for, even with more rumors of possible curtailments in August in Trinidad and Tobago . Expectations are for a Tampa July agreement next week.
US NOLA: Returns on ammonia barges down
Possible returns on ammonia barges and railcars loading for inland destinations from the US Gulf have declined, and are indicated within a substantially lower range than seen in prior weeks. Much of this decline is due to fill indications in the US interior that are $40-50/st lower than in prior weeks.
For now returns on spot sales up river and quotes based on import costs suggest a range of $430-$460/st FOB New Orleans, with the midpoint of the range declining about $35/st from prior weeks.
US Midwest: Fill offers cited below cash market
Distributors in the Midwest claim Koch Nitrogen is offering fill ammonia for delivery in time for the fall season at $535-540/st FOB terminals. This would be $50-60/st below cash costs for the current season, and reflects the bearish attitude reported from farmers and retailers for the upcoming crop year.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic Sea: Yara buys 20,000 mt at $400/mt FOB
Yara has secured 20,000 mt ammonia from Baltic suppliers at a reported $400/mt FOB for July lifting. The cargo will be taken to Yara’s European units in Sweden, Finland and France after a fire at Yara’s ammonia plant in Brunsbüttel, Germany late last week affected its own supply chain. The impact of the fire is still unclear.
Koch is still reported negotiating the purchase of a further 40,000 mt cargo with Baltic suppliers for July lifting.
Black Sea: Netbacks down on CFR sales at lower prices
Black Sea trade has been extremely quiet with prices under downward pressure.
A recent sale to Turkey’s Petkim points to Yuzhnny values in the $370s/mt FOB while a 25,000mt Trammo sale to OCP possibly off the Touraine is reported providing netbacks in a similar range.
Trammo will lift a further 5-8,000 mt ex-DnieproAzot on the Marycam Swan late June or on the Touraine early July pursuant to a deal concluded several weeks ago around $390/mt FOB. It is unclear where the balance tonnage will be sourced from.
Trammo’s Sylvie which be loaded with 23,000 mt ex-TogliattiAzot June 26 under a product swap with Ameropa will likely be directed to buyers east of Suez under spot and contract business.
Koch is reported back in negotiations with Black Sea suppliers for a 40,000 mt cargo for July lifting. The trader's Jenny N will lift a similar volume June 25 for the US.
EUROPE
Turkey: Petkim buys small parcel from Trammo
Turkey's Petkim has secured 6,000 mt from Trammo for mid-July delivery in the low $400s/mt CFR. This is at least $8/mt down on previous sales done in the country to Bagfas and Igsas.
Bagfas is reported in the market for another 6-7,000 mt for July delivery.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Tunisia: Short term ammonia demand unchanged
Tunisian ammonia demand is unlikely to significantly improve over the coming weeks. There is still no reported DAP production as Gabes and rock supply is still subject to some disruption.
Morocco: OCP keeps pressure on Black Sea suppliers
OCP continues to push for ammonia cargoes below $400/mt CFR equating to a $350/mt FOB Yuzhnny netback.
Trammo's recent 25,000 mt sale to OCP off the Touraine for early July delivery was reported fixed in the low $400s/mt CFR.
Middle East: Scarce activity as Ramadan begins
Ramadan observance commenced this week with limited Middle East activity reported.
All Sabic units are reported running as normal. The Safco V urea plant continues to undergo trials and given no further updates it is assumed that full capacity production is still expected to start at the end of June.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Demand flat and prices steady
Indian demand is reported flat week-on-week with prices unchanged at $415-450/mt CFR.
IFFCO will take delivery of a 40,000 mt contract cargo from Ameropa off the Clipper Mars early July.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Australia: Orica linked to 19,000 mt spot purchase
Australian ammonium nitrate (AN) producer Orica has reportedly secured 19,000 mt ammonia from a trader around $500/mt CFR for first half July delivery owing to a technical issue at its plant.
Mitsui could conceivably be the provider of the cargo after being awarded Kaltim’s 20,000 mt June 11 sales- tender at $437.50/mt FOB for loading end June.
Yara’s 759,000 mt/year Pilbara ammonia facility is running normally after another technical issue interrupted production early June.
Taiwan: Buyers resist potential price increases
Taiwanese buyers report suppliers’ attempts to push prices up are gaining little traction.
Demand remains weak from industrial consumers while fertilizer usage will decrease over the coming two months during the off-season.
TFC received one 23,000 mt contract cargo discharged June 15 priced at $430-440/mt CFR with a similar sized cargo to follow July 20.
Indonesia: Petrokimia Gresik linked to CJ tender
An award in CJ Indonesia's June 16 import tender for 6,000 mt is reported to Petrokimia Gresik at $448/mt CFR. Delivery was requested July 28-30. The product will likely be sourced from Pupuk Kaltim.
The buyer’s May 25 tender was awarded to Yara at $437/mt CFR.
South Korea: Imports down on lower contract deliveries
South Korea ammonia imports for May down 14% at 74,030 mt reflect continued weak demand from industrial consumers.
January-May figures show an almost identical picture for imports, down 15% at 435,259 mt.
Contract ammonia deliveries have been reduced in 2015 owing to an expected decrease in demand with any urgent needs covered by spot purchases from Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Imports from Australia for the first five months of this year fell 1% to 179,548 mt while offtake from Saudi Arabia was down 71% at 69,617 mt. Imports from Indonesia climbed 26% at 52,307 mt and 196% from Malaysia at 47,372 mt.
South Korea: Additional cargoes still a possibility
Namhae and SFC report a quiet week in ammonia but suppliers seek purchasing interest in spot cargoes for the short term. Both buyers insist they will not consider additional parcels outside contract commitments until late July/early August at the earliest owing to current high inventories.
Contract prices remain unchanged around $450/mt CFR with SFC to receive a total of 23,000 mt from Trammo at the end of July in two shipments.
