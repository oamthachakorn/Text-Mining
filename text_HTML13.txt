Market Summary
China setting a high floor
Traditional differentials are being overturned in the urea market, where Chinese prills continue to edge higher while granular urea stagnates. Benchmark prices for Arabian Gulf granular have moved up to $310/t fob at the low end, but remain flat at the upper end, with $313/t fob the last done. Yuzhny prills have moved up to $298/t fob, but are lagging Chinese prices by $5-10/t.
Courtesy of an unusually strong domestic market and some injudicious short-selling by traders, Chinese producers are in the driving seat. Prilled urea prices have moved up to $303- 304/t fob China this week and asking prices are $310/t fob and above. Better returns are still obtainable from the local market and producers are sending little urea to the ports.
Inventories of prilled urea at Chinese ports are estimated at less than 200,000t against about 500,000t that has to load in June to complete sales made to India and Pakistan. The implication is clear: prilled urea will continue to rise as trad- ers are obliged to pay up to cover their sales.

This unusual erosion of the traditional price differential will effectively cap the increase in prilled urea as some buyers, for example India, can take either grade. But equally, it will provide a floor for international prices into July, because suppliers in the AG and elsewhere will refuse to sell at lower levels.
The paper market is showing lower prices into July, based on the assumption that supply will eventually increase in China and that prices will fall back in the US during the summer months.
But China has surprised everyone this year with its ability to hold onto price gains and may continue to do so.

NF Trading has bought 25,000t of prilled urea at $298/t fob Yuzhny to cover its requirements for contract buyers in Italy. This is due to the closure of its Cherkassy urea plant last week.
Dreymoor purchased 30,000t of prilled urea from DniproAzot in the low-$290s/t fob last week prior to the announcement about Cherkassy. This week, Koch bought 5,000t of Yuzhny urea at $292/t fob from another trader for June shipment. Prior to this, Trammo purchased 10-15,000t of OPZ urea at $290/t fob for June.
The Cherkassy closure will remove about 55,000t/month from Ukrainian urea supply, leaving DniproAzot, 60-70,000t/ month, and OPZ, 60,000t/month, as the only suppliers. NF Trading recently shipped 25,000t of urea to Turkey for its Vitagro operation, but was short for its Italian sales.
OPZ may have another 10-12,000t of prilled urea to sell for June.

Eurochem is sold out for June but is starting to discuss 25- 30,000t of granular for early-July shipment. Canadian buyers are also starting to check the market for granular urea for July arrival. It will load 2 x 10,000t of prilled urea in Tuapse in June on combination cargoes for the US.
Baltic
Urea prices are moving up. Netbacks from Brazil set the low end of the range this week in the mid-$280s/t fob, but one 3,000t parcel did sell late in the week at $300/t fob for June to a trader who was short. It is not clear whether this price is immediately repeatable. But producers are now indicating $300/t fob for the next sales.
Ameropa will load 10,000t of prilled urea in combination with 25,000t of AN in Riga and Klaipeda in early-June for Santos, Brazil. Helm is in the market for a vessel to load 12,000t of granular urea 20-30 June in Riga or Damietta for Hamilton, Canada.
Keytrade has fixed a tbn to load 27,000t of prilled urea prompt in Kotka for Beira at about $37.50/t.
Koch is in the freight market for a vessel to load 40,000t of prilled and granular urea in the Baltic for Brazil in June.
Europe
The maize season in southern Europe has only another 10 days to run and it is now too late to bring in any further ves- sels of granular urea. Pricing has switched fully to forward offers for delivery in second half 2015, with only product already in the country able to sell at high prices for prompt.
France
Forward offers of granular urea are in the range €302-307/t fca in Atlantic ports, equivalent to $300-305/t fob North Africa. Sales in Mediterranean ports are taking place at €4- 5/t less.

Middle East Export Sales
Germany
Firmer international prices have supported urea levels in Germany, despite minimal trade. Indications for 2H 2015 de- livery have firmed to €305-310/t fca for granular and €290/t fca for prilled. This compares with indications around €285/t fca and €270/t fca respectively, two weeks ago.
SKW Piesteritz reports previously selling granular urea at around €300/t fca seaport and above for delivery July
2015-January 2016, but has since withdrawn offers and will list official prices later in June.
Italy
Application on maize will end in mid-June and the demand for prompt delivery dates has pushed domestic urea prices higher. Yara is now fully booked for delivery through to mid-June. In addition, recent import cargoes from Egypt and Algeria have been priced at higher levels, also supporting a

rise in domestic urea prices.
Spot prices range €345-350/t fca big bags (equivalent to
€350-355/t fca 50kg bagged), up from €335-345/t fca big bags two weeks ago. This would equate to around $355-366/t cif port duty paid/free.
Turkey
Kastamonu bought 4,000t under its 28 May tender for prilled urea at a price reflecting the low-$290s/t fob Yuzhny.
Middle East
There is no spot cargo left to sell for June from the AG producers. Indications for July are starting to emerge around $320/t fob. No markets are paying that level yet and the paper market has traded lower this week; July is bid at $287/t fob and offered at $295/t fob on FIS. But the strength of Chinese prices suggests that AG producers will not need to sell anywhere close to that level when they negotiate July cargoes later this month.
Oman
SIUCI is indicating prices in the low-$320s/t fob for its next available urea cargo, which is for early-July loading.

The Sorfert urea plant remains down following the break- down on 17 May. It is hoped that the plant, which can produce 3,500t/day of granular urea, will resume production next week. Inventories at the plant are close to zero.
Traders, including Helm, Indagro and Nitron, have had car- goes delayed by the force majeure declaration, but should be able to begin loading them from mid-June.
Trammo completed loading 25-30,000t of granular urea for Brazil at the AOA berth last week and Ameropa was loading

another 30,000t for Brazil at presstime. Traders are nomi- nating vessels mainly for Brazil at present.
Egypt
Urea production rates remain severely curtailed by the lack of natural gas. By press time, only EFC was operating out of the main urea exporters. However, it was only running one of its 55,000t/month lines at inconsistent rates. OFT is taking product to cover for the force majeure at Sorfert. One 7,000t sale is reported to the UK netting to $320/t fob Damietta.
Alexfert remains down this week with no restart set. Mopco was operating at around 1,200t/day early in the week, before going down again on 4 June. Its new 650,000t/year line was now expected to start-up in July, assuming there is sufficient gas supply.
HFC was also understood to have shut down on 4 June, although this could not be confirmed directly.
Libya
Yara will load 18-19,000t of prilled urea in Marsa el Brega
4-8 June for Lome, Togo, and Douala, Cameroon, on a vessel
fixed at $27/t.
South Africa
Urea imports were down 36pc in the first four months of 2015 at 99,000t, with imports in April amounting to just 25,000t and comprising only one full cargo from Qatar. Im- ports have picked up in May and will be large in June, given the number of cargoes booked from the AG.
Asia
Pakistan
TSP tendered on 29 May and 1 June for 50,000t of urea. It made awards as follows:
29 May tender – Dreymoor 50,000t at $318.63/t cfr Kara- chi
1 June tender – Samsung 50,000t at $318.53/t cfr
Both companies are expected to ship from China. The prices are estimated to netback in the high-$290s/t fob after allow- ing for freight of $16-17/t from north China plus other costs.

TCP reduced the guaranteed discharge rate for the second tender to from 3,500t/day to 2,000t/day, which would in- crease the freight cost.
TCP is expected to tender for a further 150,000t of urea in early July for the summer crop.
Latest estimates from NFDC for the kharif (April-September) season include this quantity, with the 250,000t to be bought by TCP added to the 91,000t delivered in April-May by Sabic:

China
The available quantities of prilled urea are being snapped up at Chinese ports, with $303-304/t fob paid early in the week for small quantities but producers asking $310-312/t fob for larger cargoes. Producers are railing very little prilled urea to the ports and there is active demand from traders who sold to India and, since the weekend, Pakistan.
While the 100,000t needed for Pakistan may have been cov- ered, traders are reckoned to have 5 cargoes still to buy for India, equivalent to around 300,000t.
Dreymoor has been in the market for a geared vessel to load 55-65,000t of urea in north China for India-Pakistan range 10-13 June. Samsung is in the freight market for a vessels to load either 50,000t or 2 x 25,000t of urea in Longkou, Jinzhou or Yantai for Pakistan end-June or early-July, basis 2,500t/day discharge.
Domestic market prices rose last week and producers are taking a very strong stance on pricing before they agree to move more urea for export. With another Indian tender likely in June and the summer season due to start in July, this stance is unlikely to change.
Stocks in Chinese ports are less than 200,000t of prills and the unsold quantity is believed to be below 100,000t, spread across all ports.
Granular urea supply is easier and prices are not moving up. In fact, the granular market appears to have peaked and the differential with prills is narrowing. Asking prices are $313-314/t fob for June. Gavilon has bought 2 x 25,000t of granular urea at $311-313/t fob. China BlueChem is reported to have sold one Fudao granular urea cargo of about 25,000t from its June availability in the mid-$310s/t fob.
Liven is loading 60,000t of prilled urea in Qinhuangdao at present for IPL/India. Trammo has fixed a combination cargo of 60,000t of granular urea, amsul and kieserite loading in Bayuquan and Yantai in second half May for Nola and Tampa at $17/t.

India
Traders have so far nominated vessels to load about 400,000t to IPL out of awards totalling 775,000t under its 9 May tender, as follows:
Global, m/v JK Monowara loaded 31,160t in Iran showing eta Kandla 4 June
Transagri, m/v Kiazand loaded 31,480t in Iran and show- ing eta Kandla 6 June

Transmart, m/v Hamgam loading 50,000t in Iran for Krish- napatnam
The monsoon was on track to hit southern India 4-5 June, about four days later than forecast. The latest forecast from the Indian Meteorological Department is for the monsoon to be only 88pc of normal, categorized as deficient. It should be noted that the 2014 monsoon was also below average but urea sales still rose in the 2014-15 fertilizer year.
Indonesia
Kaltim held a sales tender on 3 June for 2 x 30,000t of granular urea for latest shipment from Bontang by the end of June. It set a reserve price of $325/t fob but the highest bid it received was $302/t fob from CHS. Kaltim scrapped the tender. Traders subsequently bid $311-312/t fob to Kaltim outside the tender, but no sales are reported.
Thailand
Prices for non-Chinese granular urea are around $320/t cfr, moving up slowly in response to higher fob levels from the AG and Indonesia.
Urea imports recovered to 207,000t in April, similar to the
200,000t imported in April 2014, according to data from Thai Customs, but overall imports for the first four months of 2015 were down 15pc year-on-year. January-April imports were 550,000t in 2015; Sabic supplied 251,000t, Petronas 97,000t and Muntajat 87,000t of this.
South Korea
Namhae tendered on 3 June for 6,000t of granular urea for 21-25 June delivery to Kwangyang. It bought the cargo at a price equivalent to $305-310/t fob China.
Pungnong tendered on 4 June for 6,000t of prilled urea for June shipment. It awarded the tender to a trader at $314/t cfr, netting to the high-$290s/t fob China.
Australia
Dry weather and concerns about water supply for the 2015 crop mean that there is little further demand for spot urea cargoes for Australia in June. Several cargoes are being shipped at present from the AG and Indonesia, which are judged sufficient to cover demand for June and July arrival.
Americas
US
The US urea market was largely unchanged this week, still covering a wide range but with most loading windows trad- ing at similar values to last week. The main exception was loaded barges, which declined about $8/st following the last day of May. Suppliers continue to buy barges to replenish warehouses for corn top dress, the window for which has been extended by cool weather preventing the crop from getting too tall. Rice demand in the southeast will also pick up later this month and continue in July. For now stable but lower consumption and the slower pace of imports seem well matched.
Trades for loading within 30 days concluded in the range of $319-355/st fob Nola, nearly unchanged from $320-358/st fob Nola last week. The high end was set by loaded barges traded early in the assessment window, while the low end references a trade for June loading. This week last year the assessment was $300-342/st fob Nola, which precluded a rally to near $400/st with the market undersupplied for late- season demand including rice. Rice demand will be lower this year, however, due to the reduction in plantings.
Urea imports down in April
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
Imports of urea into the US fell by 34pc in April to 631,000t, in reaction to declining prices and the perception that the market was already well-supplied. Overall imports July
2014-April 2015 were 6.56m tonnes, up from 5.99m tonnes in the same period of 2013-14.
Mexico
Isaosa tendered this week for 25,000t of granular urea for June shipment to the west coast. Samsung is reported to have taken the business in the mid-$330s/t cfr, netting to about $313/t fob China.
Brazil
The stand-off on price has continued for another week. Granular urea importers have upped their bids to $320/t cfr. Offers remain close to $330/t cfr but no spot business is reported this week. Paper market trades have taken place at $323 and $324/t cfr for June, perhaps indicating where prices will settle. One sale of prilled urea is reported at $308/t cfr for June.
Chile
CHS has sold 25,000t of Chinese granular for first half July shipment to Chile in combination with 5,000t each of MAP and GTSP. The price reflects about $310/t fob north China.
Uruguay/Argentina
Ameropa has sold 20,000t of granular urea to several buy- ers from an AG cargo that is said to be floating. Isusa had a prompt requirement for 10,000t and is reported to have paid $338/t cfr. Nidera also bought 4-5,000t.
In Argentina, Nidera is in the market for 15,000t of granular urea for June shipment.
Ammonium Sulphate/Nitrate
Turkey
Gubretas is receiving 20-25,000t of capro grade amsul from OCI in June at $170/t cfr under a deal agreed two months ago. A second 20-25,000t cargo will be shipped from Ant- werp in July.
Otherwise, the market is quiet. Prices for Chinese amsul are too high to encourage any early buying.
The extent to which Turkey has become reliant on Chinese amsul was highlighted in the statistics for March imports. China supplied three-quarters of the 100,000t imported in
March and in total shipped 191,000t in the first quarter. Tur- key imported 266,000t of amsul January-March, 45pc more than in the first quarter of 2014, suggesting that there has been some stock-building.
Egypt
One sale of 3-5,000t of capro grade amsul is reported for June shipment from the Black Sea around $180/t cfr, ru- moured to be SBU product.
China
Amsul prices remain very firm but are moving up only very slowly. Prices for capro grade amsul are a minimum of $132/t fob this week, while steel grade material is only $3-4/t lower.
Indagro is in the market for a vessel to load 30,000t of amsul in Qinhuangdao 4-6 June in combination with 27,000t of NPs for Brazil.
Brazil
Price indications for capro grade standard amsul for June business were flat this week, with European and Chinese product pegged at $170/t and $160/t cfr Paranagua, respec- tively. Granular grade is on offer at $225-235/t cfr Parana- gua, depending on importers’ volume requirements, for both EU and US amsul.
Russian AN has sold at $225/t cfr this week, basis June shipment, reflecting the low-$200s/t fob Baltic port. Freight from the Baltic to Brazil is $20-23/t basis one port discharge.
Mexico
The market is short of amsul due to limited domestic pro- duction and the block on Chinese and US imports. European suppliers are sold out for June.
Black Sea
Sales of steel grade amsul have taken place this week at $136-138/t fob for Ukrainian origin and in the high-$120s/t fob for Russian (dutiable) product.
Ameropa has sold cargoes of AN to buyers in Albania and Morocco at prices netting below $205/t fob Black Sea. It will load 3-4,000t of Russian AN in June for Albania and 6-7,000t for Morocco.
Eurochem reports selling 7,000t of AN to an African market, believed to be Mozambique, at a price netting to $225/t fob Novorossisk.

Following on from Yara’s 26 May notice, OCI announced new season CAN 27 prices for Germany and Benelux markets ef- fective 1 June as follows: June €225/t cif inland; July €230/t cif inland; August €235/t cif inland. Last year, OCI’s initial pre-storage price for the new season was €230/t cif inland. Yara then subsequently announced its July price for Ger- many in line with OCI.
The new season announcements came earlier than many anticipated and caught out some sellers still holding higher- priced inventory. Just ahead of the new season announce- ment, Russian CAN had been sold at €240/t fca seaport, but prices would now need to be adjusted downwards.
Nonetheless, wholesalers, cooperatives and retailers are stepping in to book, aware that the new season price is traditionally the lowest of the campaign. An added incentive this year is the timing, as there is still demand for the pres- ent season for use on both crops and grassland.

namely the southeast.
In the import market, buyers are inquiring for UAN 32 for July but are finding offers at $235-236/t cfr for Russian material, up from $223/t cfr last done in the Gulf. The $205/ st fob Nola price now seen for summer fill is equivalent to $226/t and should set a base for imports. It is equivalent to about $185/t fob Black Sea.
Argentina/Uruguay
Bunge is in the market for 25,000t of UAN 32 for July ship- ment to Argentina, bidding initially at $225/t cfr in line with prices achieved for June cargoes. Offers from suppliers are in the $230s/t cfr.
Maccio is negotiating 15,000t of UAN 32 for July shipment to Uruguay.
UAN Solutions
France
Price indications for UAN 30 for second half 2015 delivery have moved up to €193-194/t fca but demand has died away. There are only 1-2 traders offering at that level, however. Other traders have put out offers at €200/t fca to indicate their intention to move prices higher during the second half.
The m/t Yangon is due to arrive in La Pallice in the first half of June with 41,000t of UAN 32 from the US. Freight is reported fixed at about $1.2m lumpsum. This is the first of a rumoured two vessels sold by CF Industries to co-op buyers in France. The vessel will complete discharge in Rouen.
US
The US UAN market continues to transition from spring to summer fill buying, and transactions have been widely re- ported at $205/st fob Nola for June or July loading. Produc- ers have not published summer fill values, but some business has already concluded for that timeframe. Meanwhile, the market for prompt-loading tons is unclear, but still carries a premium to fill values.
Carryout from the ongoing spring season is expected to be modest overall, but there will be some regional pockets of excess supply where wet weather crimped applications—
Egypt
Abu Qir has told buyers that it has no interest in producing UAN at current price levels – around $180/t fob – and there is no news on when it may offer UAN again for export.

Construction begins on Phosagro urea unit
Construction work has begun on the new granular urea planned by Phosagro at its Cherepovets site in Russia.
With a capacity of 495,000t/year of urea, this will be the third unit at the site and is part of a comprehensive invest- ment project based on a new energy-efficient, 760,000t/ year ammonia plant at Cherepovets.
The country's floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), the 170,000m³ Hoegh Gallant, arrived at Ain Sukhna at the beginning of April. It has a regasification capacity of 550mn ft³/d (5.7bn m³/yr).
Egypt has since made firm enquires for a second FSRU, which could be located at the same site as the first — Ain Sukhna, near the Suez Canal at Adabiya — or in the Mediterranean Sea.
The contract for the design and supply of equipment for the granular urea unit was awarded to the Czech firm Chemo- projekt Nitrogen in August 2014. It will use Stamicarbon’s granulation technology.
Egypt takes sixth LNG cargo
The 160,000m³ Cool Explorer is scheduled to arrive at the Egyptian port of Ain Sukhna on 3 June carrying a Qatari LNG cargo. This is the sixth cargo shipped since Egypt started to import LNG in April to mitigate the shortage of gas in the country.
So far all the additional gas has gone to the power sector and there is little discernible increase in gas supply to pro- cess industries such as fertilizers.
The vessel was chartered by trading firm Trafigura, accord- ing to shipping sources. Trafigura has agreed to supply 33 LNG cargoes to Egypt in 2015-16, while fellow trading firm Vitol will supply nine cargoes over two years from June. Noble Clean Fuels, a unit of Hong Kong-based commodities trading firm Noble Group, will provide seven cargoes over two years. Algeria's state-owned Sonatrach has agreed to supply six cargoes to Egypt in April-September.
