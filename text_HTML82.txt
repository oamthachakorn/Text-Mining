ANALYSIS
Potash suppliers focus on Brazil as other prices slip
Potash spot prices in the US and Southeast Asia fell again this week as the regions enter a lull in activity but suppliers remain hopeful that prices in Brazil will strengthen in the coming months.
Two sMOP tenders in Malaysia for a total of 15-20,000 mt have been awarded as low as $300/mt CFR this week as the country's tender season comes to an end. The price highlights how weak prices have been in the Southeast Asian market so far in 2015 with currency depreciation and low palm oil prices key.
Standard potash deals are seen at $300-345/mt CFR across Southeast Asia, with the average level a premium of only $5-10/mt on the current Chinese contract price.
In the US, traders claim that granular potash barges are now available as low as $320/st FOB New Orleans with some importers trying to liquidate positions. Expectations are weak, with some sources predicting even lower values over the summer. Midwest distributors adjusted their offers last week to compete with fill offers available from some US and Canadian suppliers. That $20/st decline brought quotes from river terminals along the upper Mississippi River and inland warehouses from Nebraska to Ohio to $365-370/st FOB, and barge delivered indications to $350/st DEL.
With the European market out of season, there is currently very little activity other than for small volumes of summer fill. Prices remain €300-310/mt CIF for granular potash and around €280/mt CIF for standard potash. The Chinese domestic market is also off-season. The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($322-332)/mt FCA but at the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, small quantities are said to have been purchased by small buyers at RMB 2,120 ($342)/mt FCA.
Suppliers continue to highlight Brazil as the key region for price improvement and hope that higher prices in Brazil can drive forward recovery in the other potash markets. According to new GTIS data, Brazilian potash imports are down 30% so far this year at 2.3 million mt with all of the major suppliers seeing major falls in deliveries so far this year. Producers expect that seasonal demand will pick up towards autumn and price improvement is near.
Brazilian prices currently remain stable at $330-340/mt CFR but suppliers are said to be selling no lower than $335/mt CFR. Producers have set prices at $340-345/mt CFR for July delivery and hope that values could rise to as high as $350-360/mt CFR in the coming months. While most sources do expect some kind of increase, many continue to highlight issues with farmers, particularly regarding credit, which may limit price increases and note that if one supplier slips from price discipline in the coming months then suppliers' optimism over prices in Brazil could quickly disappear.

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.
MARKETS
MOP
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Prompt market adjusts to fill expectations
Distributors adjusted their offers last week to compete with fill offers available from some US and Canadian suppliers.
That $20/st decline brought quotes from river terminals along the upper Mississippi River and inland warehouses from Nebraska to Ohio to $365-370/st FOB, and barge delivered indications to $350/st DEL.
US NOLA: Potash barge quotes lower
Traders claim granular potash barges now are available as low as $320/st FOB New Orleans, as some importers still are trying to liquidate positions.
Previous quotes at $325/st FOB are profitable assuming they can be resold in the Midwest at $365-370/st FOB, but traders do not expect to see any gains in coming weeks or month in the barge market, and some still predict even lower values over the summer.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Prices firm as deals build for July
Prices remain stable in Brazil as June deals at previous price levels continue to enter the market but deals for July delivery are said to have already secured the $340/mt CFR price.
Previous deals from before new price ideas were set at IFA are believed to still be holding down the low-end of gMOP imports at $330/mt CFR but new deals from Canpotex and previous deals from BPC are seen at $340/mt CFR for June delivery. As a result potash prices remain at $330-340/mt CFR but no supplier is believed to currently be selling below $335/mt CFR.
Uralkali is said to be sold out for June deliveries and has set a price of $345/mt CFR for July deals. BPC and Canpotex are believed to have priced June and July deliveries at $340-345/mt CFR while SQM is expected to offer at least $340/mt CFR for July deliveries and could raise its prices to as high as $350/mt CFR.
Most sources expect that the new price levels will stick and could rise to the $350-360/mt CFR level by the end of August but many continue to highlight issues with farmers, particularly regarding credit, which may limit price increases and note that if one supplier slips from price discipline in the coming months then suppliers optimism over prices in Brazil could quickly disappear.
Brazil: Imports down 30% on weak demand in 2015
Brazil imported 2.3 million mt of potash between January and May, a 30% fall (1 million mt) year on year, according to GTIS data.
During the period, Canpotex reduced volumes to Brazil by 29% to 646,000 mt, BPC reduced volumes by 43% to 434,000 mt and Uralkali reduced volumes by 40% to 398,000 mt. K+S sent 388,000 mt, ICL sent 358,000 mt (with almost half coming from its Spanish and UK operations) and SQM sent 106,000 mt.
In May, potash imports fell by more than a half to 607,000 mt. Canpotex deliveries fell by almost 60% to 171,000 mt, BPC volumes fell 55% to 161,000 mt, K+S volumes fell 22% to 101,000 mt and Uralkali volumes fell 66% to 90,000 mt.
Currency depreciation, weak agricultural prices and credit issues in Brazil have forced down farmer demand and caused a drop in spot prices amid strong competition in Brazil.
Chile: SQM exports fall 16% January-April
SQM exported 360,000 mt of potash between January and April 2015, a 16% fall year on year, according to GTIS data.
During the four month period, SQM sent 130,500 mt to Brazil, 54,000 mt to US (double the levels at this time last year to the US), and volumes between 15,000 mt and 30,000 mt to Mexico, Thailand, South Africa and Europe.
In April, SQM exported 98,000 mt of potash, a 24% fall year on year. SQM sent 39,000 mt to Brazil, 29,000 mt to Thailand and 12,000 mt to South Africa during the month.
The company saw a 27% fall in revenues during Q1 2015 to $387.5 million as MOP and SOP sales volumes fell 48% due to delays in shipments. MOP and SOP revenues fell 42% overall to $87.9 million during the period.
In the company's Q1 report, SQM said it expects sales volumes to significantly increase in the rest of 2015 but volumes over the full year will likely be below the 1.6 million mt shipped in 2014.
EUROPE
Europe: Little activity as euro improves
With the European market out of season, there is currently very little activity in Europe other than for small volumes of summer filler. Prices remain €300-310/mt CIF for granular potash and around €280/mt CIF for standard potash.
The average granular MOP price in Europe currently translates to $345/mt after recent improvements in the euro price against the dollar. The price is relatively high against current major markets like Brazil and is equal to many of the smaller granular markets worldwide.
The euro has improved against the dollar by 7.2% since mid-March but overall remains down 20% on the same point last year.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Uralkali shipment to arrive this week
Vessel data from India shows just one vessel carrying almost 30,000 mt of potash from Uralkali for IPL arriving this week. The vessel brings total shipments in June to more than 100,000 mt so far.
ICL is expected to announce their agreed volumes to India by the end of the month, with some Indian buyers already confirming that agreements have been made. ICL's total volumes should be similar to the 700,000 mt it sent in the last fertilizer year.
Potash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Philippines: Potash imports up 12% in first quarter
The Philippines imported 52,676 mt of potash in Q1, a 12% increase year on year and its largest Q1 imports since 2010, according to GTIS data.
During the period, the Philippines imported 31,000 mt from Canpotex and 10,000 mt from Chinese storage, most likely from BPC.
Most of the quarter's potash imports came during March, with monthly volumes more than double the previous year, at 36,000 mt, including 30,000 mt from Canpotex.
Southeast Asia: Prices slip further across region
Malaysian potash is quoted at $300-315/mt CFR this week, with two tenders totalling 15-20,000 mt said to have been sold at the very weak $300/mt CFR level, the supplier is yet to be confirmed.
The tender season has largely come to an end in Malaysia and buyers were said to be looking for $295/mt CFR levels before agreeing to prices in the two tenders around the $300/mt CFR level.
Malaysia has turned out to be a very difficult market for sellers so far in 2015. The ringgit has weakened 16% against the dollar in the last year, palm oil prices remain at low levels, demand is weaker than some expectations and some sources highlight quite strong stocks. All these factors mean that competition
is abundant in the country and prices have been weak so far in 2015. The Malaysian market is unlikely to build up now until August, ahead of the November season.
In Indonesia, the sMOP market is believed to be trading as low as $320/mt CFR while Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam is quoted in the $330-345/mt CFR range with very few deals up the upper end and only for very small volumes.
As a result potash prices are currently seen at $300-345/mt CFR across Southeast Asia. In previous years, average Southeast Asian prices see a $40-50/mt premium against the Chinese contract price but at this point the premium remains only around $10/mt.
China: Prices largely stable but imports slow
The Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow but some small quantity deals have edged up the top end of prices in the region.
The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($322-332)/mt FCA but at the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, small quantities are said to have been purchased by small buyers at RMB 2,120 ($342)/mt FCA.
May potash imports are believed to have been quite low, at roughly 550,000 mt, which would be a 41% fall on May 2014 imports and around 300,000 mt lower than in April. Between 100,000 and 130,000 mt is believed to have been imported by rail and 400-430,000 mt is said to have been imported by sea.
Most sources in China expect that with the market off-season, some contracted imports are being postponed and the market should build up in the coming months ahead of the autumn season.
Malaysia: Q1 potash imports up 41%
Malaysia imported 421,000 mt of potash in the first quarter of 2015, a 41% increase on the same period last year, according to GTIS data.
During the period, Canpotex volumes reduced by 13% to 140,700 mt but Uralkali more than doubled its Malaysian volumes to 93,000 mt and BPC more than tripled its Malaysian volumes to 87,350 mt. APC and ICL also each sent volumes over 30,000 mt with the ICL potash coming from Spain during the strike at ICL's Israeli Dead Sea Works operations.
During March, potash imports increased 28% to 147,800 mt with Uralkali quadrupling its volumes to 56,400 mt and BPC slightly increasing its volumes to 26,000 mt but Canpotex reduced its March volumes by 41% to 39,800 mt.
The figures confirm high levels of competition in
Malaysia, which coupled with strong inventory levels and currency depreciation, has held down prices in the key Southeast Asian country.
Australia: MOP imports soaring in 2015
Australia imported 162,065 mt of potash between January and April, an 82% increase year on year and the highest Jan-Apr volumes since 2005, according to GTIS data.
During the period, Australia imported 121,000 mt or 74% of the volumes from Canpotex, along with some volumes from ICL and K+S.
In April, Australia's potash imports fell 4.7% to 21,328 mt, but during Q1 imports more than doubled to 140,737 mt from 67,000 mt in Q1 2014, its highest Q1 MOP volume since 2003.
SOP
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: SDIC Luobupo set for summer maintenance
Chinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo is planning to close its operations for regular summer maintenance between the end of June and end of August.
Some big buyers are believed to be purchasing SOP ahead of the maintenance dates and SDIC cargoes should be sold out shortly.
Some large distributors were recently quoted as selling standard SOP from SDIC Luobupo for as low as RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT, which would represent a RMB 350/mt fall compared to SDIC's February 27 pricelist. However, Chinese SOP prices are currently quoted around the RMB 2,900/mt CPT level.
The company is believed to have produced roughly 696,000 mt SOP between January and April 2015, a 7% increase year on year.
NPKS
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Brazil: January-May NPK imports down 24%
Brazil imported 152,000 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 24% fall year on year, according to GTIS.
During the period, both Russian producers and Yara increased volumes to Brazil to 110,700 mt and 28,500 mt respectively but OCP reduced its volumes to Brazil by 79% to 9,400 mt as it focused sales in West Africa mainly.
In May, Brazil imported 24,800 mt of NPKs, a 39% fall year on year. Uralkali increased volumes to 16,200 mt but OCP reduced volumes by 91% compared to May 2014.
During the five-month period, Brazil exported 215,400 mt of NPKs, a 13% fall with 191,182 mt going to Paraguay.
In the full-year 2014, Brazilian NPK imports increased 33% year on year to 629,000 mt with Russian producers and Yara making up 83% of the volumes.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: Philippines Q1 NPK imports at record
NPK deals for 16-16-16 are quoted at $400-420/mt CFR across Southeast Asia with the high end of prices seen in Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar.
The Philippines imported 36,251 mt of NPKs in Q1, a 29% increase year on year and its largest Q1 imports on record, according to GTIS.
During the period, Philippines took 12,000 mt from Vietnamese producers, 8,000 mt from Yara and 8,000 mt from Namhae.
NPK exports from the Philippines remain on hold as Philphos does not plan to restart its NPK operations until the second half of this year, at the earliest after damage caused by Cyclone Haiyan in November 2013.
Malaysia imported 85,000 mt of NPKs in Q1, a 45% increase year on year and the highest Q1 imports since 2011, according to GTIS.
During the period, the country imported 23,600 mt from Russian producers, 15,300 mt from Belgium and 12,800 mt from Indonesia. The increase was all due to high imports in January and February. March imports fell 7.9% to 27,000 mt, with half of the volumes coming from Belgium and India.

FINANCIALS
Uralkali again extends loan facility
Russian potash producer Uralkali has signed a $25 million increase on its pre-export facility with major banks, extending the total amount to $655 million with an option to bring the total amount to $800 million.
Uralkali signed the loan increase with PJSC Rosbank with the new deal coming just a week after it signed a $100 million increase on the facility through the Bank of China.
The loan agreement, which was agreed in April, is with eight international banks, including Societe Generale, Commerzbank, Industrial Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank.
The interest rate on the deal is LIBOR plus 330 bps margin with a loan maturity of four years. Uralkali plans to use the loan for general corporate purposes, including helping fund its ambitious $4.5 billion expansion plans to raise capacity by 30% over the next five years.
PROJECTS
African Potash in talks with COMESA
African Potash has started talks with the ACTESA agency of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) over fertilizer distribution development in Africa.
The deal with COMESA, which is a free trade union for 20 African member states, is with a view to creating a new platform for the mining, production and distribution of fertilizer in Africa, mainly in the Eastern and Southern countries.
African Potash said that the agreement links with its strategy of expanding its activities and finding new downstream opportunities for the development of its Lac Dinga project in the Republic of Congo.
The Lac Dinga site is in its early stages but exploration studies at the end of 2014 found the presence of multiple potash seams. African Potash recently said it plans to start a new exploration campaign with the aim to delineate mineral resources suitable for exploitation at Lac Dinga.
Potash West upgrades phosphate and potash resource
Potash West has upgraded its phosphate resource at the Dinner Hill project in Western Australia after drilling 90 holes in 2014 and 2015.
The site is now holding an indicated resource of 250 million mt at 2.9% P2O5, a 108% tonnage and 4% grade increase.
The results will be used to develop pit design and mine scheduling studies, as part of a planned feasibility study into phosphate production at Dinner Hill.
Potash mineralisation is estimated to contain 175 million mt at 4% K2O, a 43% increase in tonnage but a 12% grade reduction.
The Dinner Hill project is 175 kilometres north of Perth and is part of the larger Dandaragan Trough Project area.
The indicated resource will now be used as part of an optimised mining plan ahead of a new scoping study which looks at two option for production. First, SSP production from the phosphate rich parts of the mine, or second using the phosphates part of the mine to generate cashflows in order to complete the development of Potash West's KMax operations.
The K-Max process, designed by Potash West, involves the production of SOP, SSP, iron oxide and aluminium sulphate from the mineral glauconite.
Vietnam's PVFCCo to increase ammonia capacity and build NPK facility
Vietnam’s PetroVietnam Fertiliser and Chemicals Corporation (PVFCCo) will revamp existing ammonia capacity at Phu My and construct a new NPK facility.
PVFCCo signed an EPC construction contract with Italy's Technip Group, Germany's ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions and PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation June 7.
Ammonia output at Phu My will increase 90,000 mt/year to 540,000 mt/year and will be used as a feedstock for the NPK plant or for direct sale to the domestic market. The projected NPK plant will have a manufacturing capacity of 250,000 mt/year.
The project is slated for completion in Q2, 2017.
Total project investment stands just shy of VND 5 trillion ($230 million), 70% of which will be financed by bank loans and the balance through the owners’ equity.
Israel: Fire at ICL's Rotem Amfert factory
A fire on June 10 that engulfed a production unit at Israeli fertilizer producer ICL's Rotem Amfert factory near the southern city of Dimona, Israel, has been extinguished, the company said in an emailed statement.
There were no major casualties although a few employees were treated for minor smoke inhalation and have since been released from the infirmary.
Initial reports suggest that one of the two phosphoric acid units has been affected but as of press-time no details could be confirmed. The site also includes a granular P&K; facility which may have been impacted.
"ICL will perform damage evaluation in consequence of the event," the statement added. A spokesman said it was "too early to tell" whether the fire began in the phosacid acid unit, adding that a committee will be set up to examine the causes of the fire.
