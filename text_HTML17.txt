UREA pricing series
Loaded urea barges move lower following expiration of May loading window
1H June, June and 1H July barge prices unchanged on the week
1H June holds $45/st premium to August
Inola/Catoosa prices surge as high as $390/st as river closure saps inventory
April urea imports down 34pc year-over-year
Prilled urea offers in China rise to $310/t fob, up $10/t from last week
Firm China fob values raise floor for global benchmarks
Brazil import price standoff continues
Outlook: Stable
China’s newfound price discipline should continue to buoy global benchmarks, but the market could struggle to absorb new production coming online this summer and fall. Spot cargoes could end up in the US depending on demand from other key granular importers like Brazil.
Ammonia pricing series
East Corn Belt offers decline with one supplier particu- larly aggressive
West Corn Belt below $600/st fot as demand winds down for the season
Oklahoma producers hold offers at $525/st fot amid lim- ited buying interest
April US ammonia imports rise 10pc year-over-year
Koch buys 40,000t more out of Yuzhny for end-June load- ing to ship to US
Saudi Arabia’s Sabic sells 23,000t cargo to Mitsui under formula
Trammo, Fertil close to finalizing 10,000-15,000t cargo for 2H June loading from Ruwais
Outlook: Stable
Steady demand from Yuzhny has helped stop the downward price trend in the west. Meanwhile, an uptick in demand in the east has for now balanced that market.

DAP pricing series
DAP barge prices slip on lack of buying interest
US phosphate prices skew flat through third quarter, stand at discount to other international markets
Inola/Catoosa DAP prices firm on Arkansas river closure
Mosaic sells 38,000t DAP/MAP/MES to South America at $471-475/t fob Tampa
US imports 158,689st DAP from Morocco in April
Bangladesh 400,000t DAP purchase tender garners 1.556mn t in offers, mostly Chinese-backed
Morocco’s OCP to ship 240,000t MAP to Brazil in June, sold at $500/t cfr
Two Tunisian phosphate rock mines restart
Outlook: Stable
The US remains the global outlier with slightly weaker pric- es, but downside is viewed as limited given Nola’s discount to other markets. Global prices are stable with resurgent Indian demand keeping producers, Chinese in particular, comfortable.

Fundamentals
Agriculture
Weather: Southern states saw a much-needed break in rain- fall this week, though precipitation coated most of the Corn Belt and Mississippi, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). While heavy storms and floods last week hindered field work in the south and parts of the Midwest, the rain proved helpful for drought-stricken areas. West Texas, Oklahoma and Minnesota are no longer considered to be in a moderate drought, according to the latest US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Drought Monitor.
Southern states saw a much-needed break in rainfall this week, though precipitation coated most of the Corn Belt and Mississippi, according to the National Oceanic and At- mospheric Administration (NOAA). While heavy storms and floods last week hindered field work in the south and parts of the Midwest, the rain proved helpful for drought-stricken areas. West Texas, Oklahoma and Minnesota are no longer considered to be in a moderate drought, according to the latest US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Drought Monitor.
Crop progress: Heavy storms and historic floods last week did little to hinder crop progress this week, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Corn plantings were 95pc complete the week ended 31 May, one percentage point ahead of the five-year average, while condition for the crop was rated 74pc good or excellent, down two percentage points from the same time last year.
US winter wheat conditions were rated 44pc good or excel- lent the week ended 31 May, 14 percentage points higher than the same time last year. Soybeans were 71pc planted, one percentage point ahead of the five-year average but 10 percentage points ahead of last week. There is some concern exceptionally wet soil conditions could force some southern farmers to switch from cotton to soybeans, which can be planted later in the year than other crops. Overall cotton plantings were 61pc completed the week ended 31 May, down from the 78pc five-year average.
Canadian farmers are rushing to replant crops after a cold snap last week curtailed progress. The region had been enjoying unusually warm weather this year, but a late-season frost affected numerous crops, from wheat in Alberta to vineyards in Ontario.
Crop prices: A weaker US dollar and field condition concerns proved bullish for crop prices this week. While the USDA’s
US Drought Monitor
weekly report did not show material impact to crops, there are reports that field conditions from Canada to Texas have been affected by heavy storms late last month.
Front-month wheat futures prices jumped 29¢/bushel from the start of the week to close at $5.23/bushel 4 June. Prices settled higher every day this week, with mid-day gains reaching as high as 16¢/bushel. Front-month soybean prices rose 20¢/bushel from the start of the week to settle at $9.46/bushel 4 June. July prices traded as high as $9.48/ bushel, the strongest value since mid-day trading on 19 May.
July corn prices were steady compared to those for wheat and soybeans, though they still settled 4 June at $3.63/bush- el, a 13¢/bushel gain from the week’s opening price.
Feedstock
US natural gas futures fell to a five-week low late-week on a government report showing a larger-than-expected increase in gas inventories, despite forecasts for warmer weather.
Nymex gas for July delivery dropped by less than 1¢/mmBtu to settle at $2.626/mmBtu.
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that gas inventories in the week ended 29 May grew by 132 Bcf (3.7bn m³) — the second largest injection on record and the second consecutive weekly injection to top analyst estimates. The large build reflects mild weather and a down- turn in demand associated with the Memorial Day holiday. Analysts surveyed by Argus had expected an injection of 124 Bcf.

In energy regulation news, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found that hydraulic fracturing has not led to "widespread systematic impacts" on underground water supply.
"We found hydraulic fracturing activities in the US have been carried out in a way that has not led to widespread systemic impacts on drinking water resources," EPA deputy assistant administrator Tom Burke said.
Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique that in combination with horizontal drilling has enabled the explo- sion in shale gas activity. Environmental groups have raised repeated concerns that its use could contaminate drinking supplies.
Those concerns have manifested in bans on hydraulic fracturing in several states. New York, which sits atop the Marcellus shale, declared a statewide ban in December, and other states like Maryland and Vermont have followed suit.
Freight
A lack of southbound grain shipments and the closure of the Arkansas river combined to firm some spot fertilizer barge rates this week.
A few northbound barges have been booked recently on
the limited amount of fertilizer still to be shipped from New Orleans. Barges are plentiful but some operators are hesitant to send equipment north because there is far less grain to ship on the southbound return trip. To offset the loss created by sending empty barges south, deals have been booked at slightly higher prices.
Grain is still shipping south from most waterways but several operators say the largest portion of available business is on the Illinois river, helping drive demand. The rate for north- bound barges heading to Ottawa on the Illinois river rose to $13.50-15/short ton from $13.50-14.50/st a week earlier. The barge rate to Joliet rose even higher, to $15-17/st from $15- 16/st last week.
Because of the supply, southbound grain rates from the Illinois river are higher than other waterways. Grain barges from the lower Illinois were priced at $17.31/st during the week ended on 2 June, the US Department of Agriculture said. Barges heading to New Orleans from the lower Ohio riv- er were priced at $9.21/st. One barge operator pulled empty barges from the Ohio up to the Illinois, believing the profit to be made offset the extra transportation costs.
The closure of the Arkansas to freight barges helped raise rates to the Inola/Catoosa hub as shippers are firm in their

need to reach the area as quickly as possible. The north- bound fertilizer barge rate rose to $18.25-20/st from $19-19/ st during the prior week.
Heavy rain has kept water levels on the waterway high. On the Arkansas state portion of the river, there are eight locks that remain out of service until water levels recede. The James Trimble lock near Barling reopened today, but that is above the closed locks, so no barges are able to pass through.
Fertilizer shippers are split between redirecting barges to other destinations and holding them until the river opens. Many have chosen to pay daily demurrage fees and ship when the Arkansas opens.
There are more than 20 tows of barges parked in Rosedale, Mississippi, waiting to head north up the river. Argus’ weekly assessment of spot demurrage has held steady at an average $300/day since mid-December.
Nitrogen
Top-dress season is in full swing with growers currently applying nitrogen products when weather allows. That consumption has kept the market balanced with both urea and UAN imports still ahead of last year’s pace. Usage over the next few weeks will be a key determinant for carryout, which for now looks to be limited across nitrogen products.
Urea (g)
The US urea barge market was largely unchanged this week with most loading windows trading at similar values to last week. Buying continues to resupply warehouses upriver—for

corn top dress in the Midwest and for rice applications in the southeast. For now, slower consumption and less imports are offsetting.
Trades for non-Chinese urea loading within 30 days conclud- ed in a range $319-355/st fob Nola, nearly unchanged from $320-358/st fob Nola. The low end of the range was set by a

trade for June loading, while the high end of the range was set by trades for loaded barges.
There was a notable drop in pricing (about $7/st) for loaded barges over the weekend, which coincided with the end of May and expiration of that window. Barges that loaded in May were priced at a premium as some suppliers needed them for contractual obligations.
Looking to the forward market, barges for loading in early July are at about a $15/st discount to June based on 1H July trades this week at $305/st fob Nola. August-loading barges were offered in the mid/high-$280s/st fob Nola this week. Based on the swaps market, the market for fall urea is at about $280/st, while 1Q 2016 is indicated in the $270s/st fob Nola, reflecting the pressure of new domestic and interna- tional production coming online over the next few months.
The most notable development this week in the urea warehouse market is a shortage in Inola/Catoosa caused by the closure of the Arkansas river. High water has made it impassable since mid May. Initially, the wet weather had stopped fertilizer demand, but with corn top-dress applica- tions ramping back up most bins in the important Southern
Plains distribution hub are near empty.
Offers for prompt loading urea rose to $385-390/st fot this week, with many suppliers forced to pull offers for anything loading in June. Barges are expected to reach Inola/Catoosa by the end of this month barring further heavy rains.
Likely reflecting pricing woes before the last two months’ rally, April urea imports fell 34pc year-over-year to 695,753st. Most of the product arrived from the Middle East and Canada with imports from China just 35,091st for the month.
Fertilizer year-to-date imports are now just 9pc ahead of last year at 7.2mn st. Given the tonnage consumed by rice demand early this fertilizer year, net supply for the period is now about even with last year.
Urea (p)
The market for both melt and feed grade prills continue to be indicated at a notable discount to granular—an unusual pricing relationship—given the prompt application demand for the latter product.
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
The market was inactive this week following a feed grade barge transaction at a netback of about $300/st fob Nola last week.
Melt grade prills last traded in the range of $275-280/st fob Nola.
International urea highlights
Prilled urea offers in China have increased to $310/t fob, up some $10/t from last week and near the level of granular there. The local market continues to absorb most of the country’s production, and producers are commanding ever higher prices for urea going to export. In an unusual price relationship, Chinese prilled urea is currently offered at about the same price as Middle East granular urea.
In Brazil, the price standoff between importers and trad- ers with granular urea cargoes continued for another week. Bids have increased to $320/t cfr, while offers are clinging to $330/t cfr. Those offers equate to about a $300/st fob Nola barge price, near the market for early July loading barges.
UAN
The US UAN market continues to transition from spring to
Genscape: Recent and expected UAN vessels
summer fill pricing, and preliminary summer fill business has concluded at values about $65/st below the highest prices achieved earlier this year. Producers have not published fill values, but some suppliers have already locked in their cost for at least some of this summer’s supply. The official fill value, where a significant portion of the inventory replenish- ment will occur, remains a moving target.
This preliminary business has been reported in the $205- 210/st range for loading in either June or July. That value is about $30/st below last year’s published fill value, which was announced in mid-June of 2014.
The market for prompt-loading UAN is unclear, but price indications suggest it would be somewhere between the fill range and the netbacks implied by upriver tank prices. Taking this into account, UAN Nola barge is assessed at $205- 225/st fob Nola this week.
Following multiple transactions for June and July arrival east coast UAN imports in the mid-$220s/t cfr, offers have increased to the mid-$230s/t cfr. Buyers are showing further interest in summer fill cargoes, but not yet at that price point.

Ammonium sulfate (g)
The US amsul market remains stable as growth in consump- tion and some production issues have more than offset lower net exports so far this fertilizer year.
Corn Belt warehouse prices are discussed slightly lower, now in the range of $310-320/st fot.
Some summer fill offers have already surfaced. One was reported at $290/st fot in the Twin Cities region.
Ammonia
Terminal values have moved slightly lower as suppliers vie to end the season with tanks empty. The Cincinnati/Jefferson- ville market is priced in the range of $291-302/st fot, down about $5/st. Some terminals further south have moved to $285/st fot.
Ammonium nitrate (p)
The AN barge market is still indicated in the range of $365- 370/st fob Nola with the last transaction earlier this spring. Since then, imported AN was distributed to warehouses under various sales agreements.
Warehouse prices have softened in some regions, particu- larly those competing with tons from domestic producers. In the Inola/Catoosa market, offers have been reported in the range of $325-335/st fot. There has also been softness noted in Corn Belt and Mid South with prices moving to $335-345/ st fot.
The Tampa market is still stable with business concluding in the range of $340-345/st fot.
Prices were marginally weaker in the US ammonia market this week as the side-dress season winds down. Inventory is tight for this point in the season, but there has been some price competition as suppliers look to unload tons before de- mand runs out. Most suppliers expect little carryover in part because cool weather has held back corn growth, allowing more time for side dress.
One supplier had some particularly competitive offers in the east Corn Belt this week, pushing the high end of prices down from $630/st fot to $620/st fot. Offers in Illinois are largely in the range of $600-610/st fot, while Indiana termi- nals are priced about $10/st higher.
In the west Corn Belt, offers are now universally below the $600/st mark with little offtake expected for the rest of the season. Offers in eastern Nebraska are at about $560/st fot.
Oklahoma production sites’ offers are still pegged at $525/ st fot. Regional offtake has been limited with most product heading east on the pipeline or by truck. There has been some talk about the issuance of summer fill prices over the

next two weeks or so.
April US ammonia imports increased 10pc year-over-year to 564,287st, bringing the fertilizer year-to-date total to 4.9mn st, a 4pc increase from the same period last year. Trinidad and Tobago has accounted for about two-thirds of that sup- ply.

Koch has bought another 40,000t from Yuzhny for end- June loading, which will ship to the US, likely on the Jenny N. The trader already loaded the Clipper Orion with 40,000t from Yuzhny for the US on 31 May. Lastly, Koch is loading about 35,000t in the Baltic for Taft, Louisiana.
Sabic has sold a 23,000t cargo to Mitsui for 10-20 July loading. The cargo will be priced on formula, and load on the Gas Quantum.
Trammo is close to finalizing a 10,000-15,000t purchase from Fertil for 2H June loading in Ruwais, which will be priced under formula upon loading.
Phosphate
US phosphate prices softened this week, with demand evaporating as spring planting concludes, while traders try to seek out summer refill prices.
DAP barges traded thinly this week, with offers for prompt/ June-loading domestic product falling as low as $418/st fob Nola, down from last week’s high of $427/st. The drop ended four weeks of gains for the DAP Nola assessment. Forward physical indications show slight backwardation, with August DAP offered at $418/st fob Nola and September trading at $416/st. Paper values are tending in line.
That flat forward curve has contributed to a lack of urgency on the buy side. US prices have disconnected from interna- tional levels, with Nola at a discount to other markets, mak- ing substantial imports unlikely in the near-term.
Second-half US import volume likely hinges on Morocco. Many traders have operated under the belief that Morocco’s OCP would resume shipments to the US in the third quarter— some estimating as much as 300,000t DAP/MAP/TSP—but if the US remains priced lower than competing markets, the Moroccans could look elsewhere to take advantage of more favorable netbacks.
US phosphate import tracker
Phosphate barge business
Chinese DAP/MAP imports figured heavily in the US’ third quarter 2014 import total at a record 86,556t DAP and 67,822t MAP for that period. But a repeat in 2015 is unlikely given resurgent Indian demand this year that has consumed much Chinese production and kept China fob prices stable at $460-475/t fob, which is higher than current Nola prices on a midpoint basis.
US phosphate import totals should ease for May and June after keeping an elevated pace during the third quarter and April. April DAP imports totaled 216,973st compared to just 23,363st during the same time in 2014, according to customs data. Moroccan DAP made up most of the total at 158,689st, with Russia accounting for 56,109st.
Moroccan DAP imports in April eclipsed the full-year 2014 total of 89,500st. Moroccan shipments to the US have tradi- tionally skewed more toward MAP, but DAP shipments have accelerated for a number of likely reasons, including an off- take agreement with PotashCorp following that company’s shutting of its Suwanee River plant (approximately 500,000 t/yr finished phosphate) and the loss of MissPhos production late in 2014 (600,000 st/yr DAP).
Fertilizer year-to-date DAP imports are 736,435st, more than six times the amount from the same time last year.
MAP imports dropped slightly year-over-year to 66,409st. Morocco and Russia were again the dominant sources at

24,211st and 38,528st, respectively. Despite the slight drop in April, fertilizer year-to-date MAP imports of 1mn st are more than double the prior-year period total.
US DAP exports declined for the fourth consecutive month to 103,652t in April, the lowest level since November 2008 (83,393t) and down from 114,566t in March. MAP exports stood at a more normal level in April at 170,751t, with about 60,000t each shipped to Canada and Brazil.
In fresh export business, Mosaic sold 38,000t DAP/MAP/Mi- croEssentials to South America at $471-475/t fob Tampa for July shipment.
US 3Q DAP imports
Mexico’s Fertinal will ship 35,000t DAP/MAP/TSP to Chile in the first half of June and has allocated a to-be-determined cargo to a trader. The producer will focus the balance of its production on the domestic Mexican market along with small lots to Central America.
DAP/MAP
Phosphate barges traded thinly this week, contributing to the move lower in offers. Prompt/June-loading domestic DAP offers fell from $423/st fob Nola early in the week to $418- 420/st, with no confirmed trades. The DAP Nola assessment is adjusted to $418-423/st fob accordingly. The MAP barge assessment is lowered by $5/st on the low end from last week to $425-435/st fob Nola to reflect an indicated $5-10/st premium to DAP.
DAP/MAP warehouse prices remain static in the face of limited demand, except for Inola/Catoosa, which has seen offers firm at $465/st fot. The higher price has been driven in part by the closure of the Arkansas river because of high water conditions. The river is not likely to reopen to barge traffic for another week or two, meaning resupply would not reach Inola/Catoosa until late June.
International phosphate highlights
Bangladesh’s purchase tender for 400,000t DAP for third quarter delivery that closed on 31 May attracted 53 offers for a total of 1.556mn t. Prices ranged from $479-534.14/t cfr plus bags/bagging. Prices for the first 400,000t ranged from $479-491/t. Most offers were backed by Chinese producers. Awards are expected to be awarded within the coming days.
Morocco’s OCP has sold 240,000t MAP for June shipment to Brazil, including one cargo for its own system, at $500/t cfr, which nets back to the mid/high-$480s/t fob Jorf Las- far. The producer has also sold 80,000t DAP/MAP to Europe for that same period at $505-515/t fob.
In Tunisia, two of GCT’s four phosphate rock mine re- started this week after operations were halted by protests in the country. The producers finished fertilizer products plants remain down as the company needs to rebuild phos- phate rock inventory before restarting, which is estimated to be at the end of June.

enter the summer refill season with no inventory. Sub-$320/ st fob Nola business has been discussed but not confirmed as of press time.
Warehouse offtake has slowed to a trickle across the Corn Belt, with planting nearing completion. Most offers stand at $370-380/st fot depending on location, with sub-$370/st prices still available in areas.
Domestic producers have yet to introduce formal summer fill prices, which remain a source of debate. Suppliers argue that prices will not come off much from the low end of cur- rent prices, pointing particularly to the international market for support. US prices have pulled to a more typical $23/t premium to Brazil after reaching nearly $50/t in March. Sustained strength in Brazil could help put in a floor for US prices. Buyers contend that a posted price adjustment down to current spot levels would not do much to inspire fresh buying interest, especially given the lack of supply concerns drive by record domestic production in the first quarter and elevated import levels since last fall.
The US import lineup for June and July looks thin at pres- ent. Russia’s Uralkali plans to ship normal volumes, likely two to three vessels over June and July. The US imports no MOP from Russia in June and July 2014, but took 70,420t in August and 135,000t in September. Other import sources are up in the air, with the impact of the now-ended strike at ICL’s Dead Sea Works plant in Israel undetermined. There is also the possibility of Belarusian tons making their way to Nola again after reestablishing a presence in the US market in the first quarter of 2015.
April imports keep up strong pace
US potash imports from Canada maintained high levels. The US imported 1mn st MOP from Canada in April, up by 5pc
year-over-year and marking the second consecutive month Canadian potash imports reached the 1mn st mark. Canadian MOP imports topped 1mn st in May and June in 2014, when easing logistical issues allowed producers to catch up on much-delayed shipments.
US imports of Canadian potash have mirrored increased pro- duction following recent mine expansions in Saskatchewan. North American potash production reached a record level in the first quarter of 2015.
Offshore MOP imports fell to their lowest level since Decem- ber, totaling 112,569st, with Russia accounting for almost the entire total. Russian imports have topped 100,000st for three straight months after achieving that level just once in 2014.
Fertilizer year-to-date MOP imports stand at 10.4mn st, a 21pc year-over-year increase, which has contributed to soft- ening US prices through the spring.
US SOP imports jumped to 27,013st, their highest point since December 2007. The rise was primarily the result of 17,474st from Germany combined with smaller lots from Canada, Chile, Egypt and Taiwan. Of the German shipments, about 10,000st went to Wilmington, North Carolina, with a pair of 3,300st loads to Norfolk, Virginia, and Nola. The Chilean ton- nage all went to San Francisco, California.
SOP has been in tight supply dating back to last year, with domestic production struggling to keep up with demand. Despite the tight supply situation, imports had not showed any notable jumps—until this month.

Sulfur
Syncrude sulfur shipments are slowing ramping up to normal volumes after restarting last week as production from crude upgraders restart. The largest of the facility’s three crude upgraders recently completed a five-week planned mainte- nance, while Shell restarted its operations at its Scotford upgrader 19 May. The two facilities produced a combined 111,994t of sulfur in January.

Sulfuric acid
PCS has pushed back the closure of its sulfur-burning sulfuric acid plant in Geismar, Louisiana. The 450,000 t/yr capacity plant was originally scheduled to close 31 May but will now shut down later this month. While it is understood that PCS has secured 75-80pc of its sulfuric acid needs via supply con- tracts, market participants are still anxious to see how much of an impact the curtailment will have on the spot market, both offshore and domestic.
The US southwest and west coast regions are still described as tight, despite a key source of supply coming back online recently. Asarco completed planned maintenance two weeks ago at its copper smelter in Hayden, Arizona. The 45,000 t/ month smelter went into a 45-day turnaround in early April.

EPA sets 2014-16 RFS levels, notes blend wall
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set rising biofuel quotas for 2014-2016 but recognized the limitations of the "blend wall" in long-delayed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) proposals released on 29 May.
Refiners, importers and other companies must ensure at least 16.3bn USG of ethanol, biodiesel and other biofuels are blended into the US transportation supply in 2015 under rules proposed by the EPA, which was acting under a court order to issue 2014 and 2015 levels by 1 June.
and proposed a 2016 level of 17.4bn USG.
The agency has worked to balance the wishes of some US lawmakers for higher biofuel usage against the realities of a US fuel infrastructure and vehicle fleet unable to legally consume volumes envisioned by Congress when it enacted the RFS in 2007.
Biofuel makers say the rules are essential to creating a level playing field with fossil fuels, while refiners say they create a regulatory burden.

limit to the amount of biofuels that US retailers and vehicles can absorb.
The proposals increase required blending levels from those last proposed in 2013 but continue to cite the limits of both consumer and retailer demand for higher-ethanol biofuels.
EPA stunned the biofuel industry in 2013 with a proposal that for the first time cited a lack of fuel infrastructure and compatible vehicles to reduce proposed biofuel blending mandates for 2014.
Rules proposed today require 106mn USG of cellulosic biofuel blending, 1.7bn USG of biomass-based biodiesel and 2.9bn USG of advanced biofuel blending as part of the total blending requirements. The proposal leaves a minimum 13.4bn USG for conventional ethanol blending.
Volumes for 2016 would require 206mn USG of cellulosic biofuel, 1.8bn USG of biomass-based biodiesel and 3.4bn USG of advanced biofuel blending, leaving a minimum 14bn USG to be filled with conventional ethanol or other biofuels.
Proposed requirements for 2014 include 33mn USG of cellu- losic biofuel blending, 1.63bn USG of biomass-based biodies- el and 2.68bn USG of advanced biofuel blending.
DAP/MAP use contributes to Lake Erie woes
A widespread switch to DAP/MAP fertilizer and post-harvest usage are likely key contributors to phosphorous runoff that has resulted in harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) researchers have found.
USDA researchers outlined 24 separate factors that collec- tively cause phosphorous runoff into Lake Erie in a study published in the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation this month. Co-author and USDA research soil scientist Doug Smith in an interview with Argus expanded on DAP and MAP fertilizer's role in contributing to phosphorous loss that leads to algal blooms.
Farmers in the western Lake Erie basin, which encompasses parts of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan, switched from TSP fer- tilizer to DAP and MAP beginning in the mid-1990s.
Indiana consumed 175,000st DAP and 126,000st MAP, the fifth and seventh highest levels in the US, respectively , in 2012, compared to only 1,012st of TSP, according to most recent data from the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO). Ohio consumed 63,000st of DAP
in 2012 (11th most in the US), 95,000st MAP (eighth most) and just 41 short tons of TSP.
DAP and MAP, while containing a similar amount of soluble phosphorous as TSP, could suffer greater phosphorous loss because of their lower acidity, Smith said. Less acidic soils result in greater phosphorous availability to plants, increas- ing the risk of soluble phosphorous loss, USDA research shows. Soils are also generally less acidic now because of stricter air pollution standards that have reduced acid rain.
Compounding the issue is the common practice of applying DAP and MAP after harvest, often onto frozen or snow-cov- ered ground. S said farmers like applying on frozen ground because it reduces the risk for soil compaction while running heavy application equipment over fields. But DAP and MAP sitting on the surface of barren soil with no crops to take up nutrients is more susceptible to running off.
"My working hypothesis is that what we're doing right now is applying about the most soluble form of phosphate that we can get to land at a time when nothing is growing on the soil and won't be for months," Smith said. "So we've kind of backed ourselves into a system that's the most prone to phosphorous loss."
Ohio lawmakers recently took steps to address applications in such situations, approving a law that will fine farmers who apply fertilizer on snow-covered or frozen ground—unless it is injected, incorporated into the soil within 48 hours or ap- plied to a growing crop.
But even regulations like that could still foster phosphorous runoff by shortening the application window.
"I think that's probably a step in the right direction from a water quality perspective," Smith said. "But from a farmer's and fertilizer industry perspective, that puts more pressure to put more product on the ground in less time."
The burden is not the farmer's to bear alone, Smith said. Many growers strictly follow fertilizer recommendations pro- vided by crop specialists or university extension programs.
Land rent agreements complicate the matter, since they require farmers to adhere to university recommendations, regardless of individual soil test results. About 50pc of farm land in the western Lake Erie basin is rented. These rec- ommendations often do not take into account the amount phosphorous already in the soil, instead just focusing on

replacing the amount taken up by the plant.
"To me, the farmer is doing what we as a scientific commu- nity is telling them to do and what the industry is providing them with and they're kind of taking the fall for it," Smith said.
Possible runoff solutions highlighted by the USDA include applying lower rates of phosphorous in line to specific soil needs and updating soil tests. Smith said that the Fertilizer Institute's 4R Nutrient Stewardship certification program is a step in the right direction.
US crop conditions unchanged after floods
Crop conditions defied expectations after heavy storms hit the Midwest and Southern Plains over the last week, ac- cording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report.
Front-month wheat futures prices jumped 16¢/bushel to close at $4.93/bushel today in anticipation of worse winter wheat conditions because of storms last week that caused flooding in the Midwest and Southern Plains.
But US winter wheat conditions were rated 44pc good or excellent the week ended 31 May, just one percentage point down from last week and 14 percentage points higher than the same time last year. Only five of the top 18 producing states reported 20pc of their wheat in poor or very poor condition. Winter wheat conditions in Texas and Oklahoma, which both recorded their wettest months ever in May, were rated 51pc and 36pc good or excellent, respectively.
Winter wheat was 84pc headed last week, up seven per- centage points on the five-year average. All winter wheat in Arkansas and Oklahoma is headed, while Texas (99pc), North Carolina (98pc), Missouri (95pc), Kansas (97pc) and Illinois (94pc) are all above the 90pc mark. Ohio (69pc) and Indiana
(79pc) are the only two states behind the five-year average.
Spring wheat condition is rated 96pc fair or better, un- changed from the previous week. South Dakota is the only state to have more than 6pc of its spring wheat in poor or very poor condition. Overall spring wheat is 91ps emerged, well ahead of the 69pc five-year average.
Overall corn condition is rated 97pc fair or better, down just one percentage point from the same time last year. Mis- souri and Kansas are the only two states with at least 10pc of corn rated poor or very poor. Favorable growing condi-
tions allowed the US to produce a record 171 bushels/acre in 2014, and the USDA has pegged 2015 projected yields at
166.8bushels/acre, which would be the second highest ever if realized.
Corn plantings were 95pc complete the week ended 31 May, one percentage point behind the five-year average. Texas (83pc), Nebraska (94pc), Kansas (86pc) and Colorado (79pc) were the only states of the top 18 producers to lag behind the average. Corn plantings are finished in Illinois.
The number of days suitable for field work was mixed the week ended 31 May. Texas (2.9) and Oklahoma (1.4) showed slight improvements despite wide-spread flooding, while Illinois (3.5), Iowa (2.3), Kentucky (3.6), Michigan (4.3) and Missouri (0.9) were saw drops in suitable days.
Soybeans were 71pc planted, one percentage point ahead of the five-year average but 10 percentage points ahead of last week. Plantings in Kansas were just 21pc completed, behind the 63pc average, while Missouri have planted 23pc of its soybean, down from the 57pc average.
Plantings for cotton and sorghum still lagged behind for the five-year averages. Overall cotton plantings were 61pc completed, down from the 78pc average, while sorghum was 43pc planted, behind its 55pc average.
Ammonia release during Agrium Borger restart
A small ammonia release during the restart of Agrium's Borger, Texas, nitrogen facility on 28 May shut down a urea plant and sent 16 contract workers to the hospital.
The company said it believes the release was caused by a "sight glass failure" in the ammonia pump in the urea plant, which was in the process of restarting. About 80 pounds of ammonia were released, Agrium said.
The 80,000 t/yr urea and 490,000 t/yr gross ammonia plants shut down on 18 May because of a tube leak in the ammonia unit's reformer.
The ammonia plant was not affected by the ammonia release and is operating normally. Agrium expects the urea plant to resume production within a few days.
The affected workers were contractors working on expan- sions at the facility. Agrium is in the process of an expansion that will add a new 610,000 t/yr urea plant and increase gross ammonia capacity to 635,000 t/yr. The company plans

to take the ammonia plant into turnaround during the sec- ond half of 2015 to tie in the expansion, while the new urea plant is expected to begin production in early 2016.
Work starts on K+S Canada potash export hub
K+S and Pacific Coast Terminals (PCT) this week began con- struction of potash export infrastructure at PCT's existing terminal in Port Moody, British Columbia.
The companies will build a warehouse with capacity to store more than 150,000t of MOP produced at K+S' Legacy mine in Saskatchewan, which is on track to begin production in the second half 2016.
The expanded terminal will also feature a new railcar un- loading station, conveyor systems and dust emission con- trols. Potash will be shipped via Canadian Pacific rail from the Legacy mine site to Port Moody.
The Port Moody project received approval to begin construc- tion from Port Metro Vancouver in March. PCT's Port Moody terminal already exports sulfur and ethylene glycol.
Germany-based K+S expects the Legacy solution mine to reach 2mn t/yr MOP capacity by the end of 2017, eventu- ally increasing to nameplate capacity of 2.86mn t/yr. When completed, it will be the first greenfield potash mine to be commissioned in Saskatchewan in nearly 40 years.
