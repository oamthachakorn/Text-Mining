UREA
ANALYSIS
US Weekly Analysis
Just as prompt granular urea values were showing some firmness, and even gains for well positioned product, forward offers for summer fill likely will limit any further hopes of a spring rebound. The fill programs are offering barge and truck volumes at inland locations for delivery during Q3.
The forward prices are only about $10/st cheaper than the prompt market when netted back to New Orleans, based on current freight. However, the inland summer fill offers are $30-35/st cheaper than prompt pricing.

UREA
US: Urea poured in during February
US granular urea arrivals surged by more more than 200,000 mt during February compared to one year earlier, pushing July-February arrival totals more than 1.1 million mt over arrivals during the first eight months of the prior fertilizer year, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce.
February 2015 imports were 868,377 st (787,786 mt), up substantially from 611,160 st (554,441 mt) one year ealier. Traditional suppliers made up most of the arrivals during the most recent month, with almost all of the those countries adding to their February 2014 volume. The largest suppliers to the US in February 2015 all were in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia at 147,576 st, Qatar at 110,060 st and the UAE at 109,953 st. An exception to the trend was Canada, whose February arrivals in the US fell to 58,057 st from 96,566 st--most likely due to domestic demand in Canada.
The February imports brought the first eight months of the US fertilizer year to 5.51 million st (5 million mt), up a whopping 1.26 million st from 4.25 million st (3.86 million mt) during the prior year period.
Major suppliers during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February were Qatar at 1.09 million st, China at 971,778 st (most of which discharged in July-December) and Canada at 600,103 st.
Exports
US urea exports in February of this year were 11,860 st , (10,759 mt) down from 16,576 st (15,038 mt) one year earlier. In both months most of the tons shipped in very small lots to about a dozen countries. During July-February of the current fertilizer year 149,455 st (135,585 mt) was shipped internationally versus 193,439 st (175,487 mt) during the prior year period. Canada remained the primary destination for US urea, with 120,862 st) loaded for that country.
US New Orleans: Seasonal divide in barge urea values
Granular urea barges available on a prompt basis at New Orleans traded as low as $265/st FOB New Orleans this week for barges in the Gulf, while granular urea barges available on up-river tows sold up to $290/st FOB.
Overall most trades occured in the low $270s/st FOB, with Chinese and non-Chinese material trading at roughly the same values. The highest price tags were for barges tied up at Cairo Illinois and St. Louis Missouri, which sold as high as $285/st FOB and $290/st FOB respectively basis New Orleans.
Summer fill
Even though the spring season is far from over for US urea consumption, importers and at least one North American producer are offering granular urea for Q3 delivery. Pricing is on a FOB truck basis from inland terminals and by barge, typically priced on a delivered basis. The indicated values in all cases generally equate to $252-254/st FOB New Orleans, allowing for a modest margin to a trader.

UAN
US: February UAN imports decline still leaves July- February arrivals in surplus
US UAN imports slowed substantially in February compared to the prior fertilizer year, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. However, the one-month drop still leaves arrivals during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year well ahead of the same period during 2013/2014. The causes for the drop in US arrivals were US importers reducing their bids at a time when other European demand was expected to increase.
February imports totaled 337,767 st (306,420 mt) compared to 479,963 st (435,420 mt) one year earlier. The majority of the reduction was seen in shipments from two key US suppliers. February arrivals this year from Trinidad and Tobago fell to 40,228 st from 117,995 st, while imports from Russia fell to 82,906 st versus 163,858 st. Canadian arrivals were up over the relevant months to 45,564 st from 26,947 st.
The February 2015 volume brought the first eight months of the current US fertilizer year's imports to 2.21 million st (2 million mt) versus 1.89 million st (1.72 million mt) for the prior year period. The key traditional suppliers remained the same year over year, with imports from Russia reaching 784,538 st during July- February, followed by Trinidad and Tobago at 502,877 st and Canada at 311,998 st. China, a relative newcomer to the US market, supplied 239,048 st in imports during July-February
Exports
US UAN exports in February were relatively modest at 51,024 st (46,289 st). The destination for 44,311 st of the total was France. July-February export cargos were 263,882 st (239,392 mt). France at 145,471 st and Argentina at 41,868 st were the primary destinations for US UAN, with CF Industries believed to have suppiled all the US exported UAN.
US Midwest: UAN deliveries starting to stack up ahead of season
Logistics ahead of seasonal demand for UAN already has applied some downward pressure on UAN in the Midwest. Distributors report efforts to find storage space for UAN have forced them to offer more aggressive prices rather than rack up substantial demurrage bills for tank cars. The impact has not been felt in the truck markets, as the difficulty is in finding homes for multiple railcars or even barge volumes. As a result, postings to retailers remain around $10/unit FOB across much of the region.
AS
US: AS imports up, exports down
Higher ammonium sulphate imports in the first eight months of the current fertilizer year and lower exports reflect anecdotal reports in recent months about the tight supply of AS due to greater demand.
However, despite the overal gain in imports during July-February, February 2015 arrivals in the US were down from February 2014 at 45,318 st (41,112 mt) versus 65,186 st (59,136 mt), according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. Canada and China supplied almost all the imported AS in February, at 29,488 st and 15,713 st respectively.
This brought July-February arrivals to 265,353 st (240,727 mt) compared to 216,068 st (196,015 mt) for the prior year period. Key suppliers to the US throughout July-February of the current fertilizer year included Canada at 154,542 st and China at 109,191 st.
Exports
AS exports from the US were off marginally in February 2015 compared to February 2014 at 108,664 st (98,579 mt) and 115,908 st (105,151 mt) respectively. Brazil at 39,685 st and Canada at 18,993 st were the largest destinations for US AS in February. For the first eight months of the US fertilizer year, exports fell to 898,933 st (815,507 mt) from 1.03 million st (932,020 mt) during the prior year period. Key distinattions for US export AS were mostly in the Americas during July-February of this year, including Brazil at 443,166 st, Peru at 108,267 st, Canada at 58,363 st and the Dominican Republic at 57,551 st.
AN
US: AN arrivals roughly even with prior year during July-February
Ammonium nitrate imports have been relatively steady this fertilizer year when compmared to one year earlier, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce, even though the US has trailed some international values for much of the July-February period. Market watchers are assuming the steady import trend in the face of discouraging pricing was due in part to some key importers choosing to meet their customer base's needs through their historical channels. But declining US demand for non-industrial AN should start to show up in import volumes in coming months.
US AN imports during February were 74,546 st (67,628 mt), down moderately from 84,502 st (76,660 mt) in February 2014. Almost all of the most recent month's imports arrived from the Netherlands at 43,933 st and Canada at 29,999 st.
July-February AN arrivals in the current fertilizer year were up modestly from the prior year period at 358,873 st (325,567 mt) versus 341,041 st (309,390 mt). Key suppliers during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February were Canada at 267,082 st, the Netherlands at 66,236 st and Georgia at 20,723 st.
Exports
While imports have been somewhat static, the US export market during July-February was up over 18% compared to the prior year period. February exports were roughly flat at 35,635 st (32,327 mt) versus 35,444 st (32,154 st). Canada was the primary destination for US AN exports during February at 23,586 st.
However, for the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February versus the prior year period exports increased to 338,111 st (306,732 mt) from 288,775 st (261,975 mt). Key destinations for US AN included Canada at 185,200 st and Mexico at 71,526 st.

AMMONIA
US: February ammonia imports move US ahead of prior fertilizer year arrivals
US ammonia imports have exceeded the prior fertilizer year through February thanks to a moderate increase in arrivals during that month compared to February 2014, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce.
Arrivals in the US during February 2015 were 462,500 st (419,311mt), up substantially from 323,747 st (293,701 mt) one year earlier. The increase was split between the two primary ammonia suppliers to the US, Canada at 103,589 st--up from 59,687 st one year earlier and Trinidad and Tobago at 345,176 st--up from 233,779 st.
These gains pushed the US import volume for July-February modestly ahead of the prior-year period, at 3.79 milliont st (3.43 million mt) versus 3.67 million st (3.33 million mt). There was very little variation in volumes among the major suppliers to the US during the first eight months of the current US fertilizer year through February versus the prior-year period. Most of the imports during the most recent period arrived from Trinidad and Tobago at 2.49 million st, Canada at 721,422 st, Russia at 222,805 st and Venezuela at 196,122 st.
The US export total through February of the current fertilizer year was 60,601 st (54,977 mt), down substantially from 124,799 st (113,217 mt) during the first eight months of the prior year. Primary destinations for US ammonia during July-February of this year were South Korea at 42,215 st and Chile at 11,026 st. February exports this year and last year were negligible.
US Midwest: Severe weather hampering ammonia application again
There is very little difference between winter storms and spring storms regarding their impact on ammonia applications in the Midwest. This week spring flash floods and tornados have replaced winter's ice storms and snow from Kansas through Indiana.
In much of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Missouri work was stopped in its tracks, leaving distributors and retailers to wait for the ground to dry out again. On the other hand in the northern reaches of Illinois and Indiana corn planting is underway. Ammonia movement in Iowa and Nebraska has been more vigorous, and as much as two-thirds of the ammonia pre-plant material has been applied in those states.
As previously noted, almost all the ammonia available for field work at this stage was purchased under forward programs, leaving the spot market in the region relatively untested. However, distributors east of the
Mississippi especially are optimistic about demand for nitrogen for use as side-dress once the corn comes up. Ammonia is arguably over-priced compared to urea in the Midwest, but retailers are likely to raise prices for urea if demand for that product increases for side-dress applications.
For now quotes east of the Mississippi River for new ammonia remain as high as $630/st FOB to retailers, while values generally are closer to $610/st FOB.
US Tampa: Only anticipation left before May ammonia talks get underway
There is little to do in the US Gulf market but wait for Mosaic and Yara to begin negotiations over Tampa pricing to cover May shipments. Presumably talks will get under way in the next couple of weeks. There would seem to be little doubt that Yara and other suppliers will boost their demands above the $485/mt CFR Tampa price tag covering Mosaic's deliveries to Tampa during April. However, as noted likely it seems Mosaic would like to claw back some of its costs given the decline in DAP pricing in the US and overseas.
PHOSPHATES
ANALYSIS
US Weekly Analysis
DAP barge values divided this week, with barges already moving north worth more than barges discharging in the US Gulf, or barges waiting without tows to begin the move to inland markets.
The result was a roughly $15/st split between the two markets, with imported tons generally worth the same as domestic production.
Suppliers are increasingly discouraged about DAP demand this spring, viewing the decline in corn prices as forcing the hands of some farmers to mine the soil of nutrients to make a profit rather than applying phosphates at normal rates. Previously this concern was limited to potash crops.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
US: DAP and MAP arrivals jumped in February
Importers showed improved timing in February, bringing 95,639 st (86,763 mt ) of DAP and 28,427 st
( 25,789 mt) of MAP to the US just a few weeks ahead of the annual re-opening of the upper Mississippi River system, according to the US Department of Commerce. One year earlier February DAP arrivals were just 2,341 st (2,124 mt) and MAP imports totaled just 3,024 st (2,743 mt).
Almost all of February 2015's DAP imports and also all of the gain between the relevant months was credited to imports from Morocco of 60,186 st and Russia of 33,191 st. MAP imports were almost entirely concentrated in Russian hands in February 2015, with 24,771 st discharging from that country.
DAP arrivals during July-February also were up compared to the prior year period at 448,516 st (406,891 mt). China took the lion's share of this trade, with 282,224 st imported mostly during July-December. Russia supplied 76,485 st of DAP during July-February. MAP imports in the first eight months of the US fertilizer year through February were 904,090 st (820,185 mt), compared to 296,770 st (269,228 mt). International MAP suppliers to the US inclued Morocco at 326,597 st, China at 253,162 st and 236,845 st.
US Tampa: Brazil not interested in DAP/MAP offers, India rumours continue
Mosaic reported no new export trade this week, following last week when the only business cited by the producer was priced on a formula for Latin America. Expectations are that Mosaic and some other global producers are waiting for greater interest late next month from Brazil. In recent weeks Mosaic has little interest in competing for business in Argentina and other markets that will likely only lower price expectations further in key Brazilian trade.
Meanwhile, rumours persist that Mosaic is trying to build an export line-up to its own system in India and other importers in that country. Expectations are that the producer might load two large cargos through June, but so far Mosaic has declined to comment on the speculation. Likely returns from India given current prices in that country and the weakness in the prompt US market make India a reasonable alternative for the US producer in coming weeks.
In the meantime, the US Tampa benchmark likely is not better than $470/mt FOB, assuming small cargoes to Central America still could yield higher returns than are indicated for Brazil and elsewhere.
US New Orleans: Market divided between up-river, Gulf indications
Business has been done at $405-410/st FOB New Orleans this week for DAP barges discharging in the US Gulf, but barges already moving north have changed hands at $415-420/st FOB, according to some traders.
Nevertheless, despite some bullishness for barges available off tows already moving along the Mississippi River system, bids are lower for load dates or barges still in the Gulf. Bids for these positions, albeit so far unsuccessful this week, have been made at $400-405/st FOB.
US Southern Plains: Flat while wet weather prevails
DAP is not moving in significant volumes so far this week, as much of the region outside of Texas is too wet for field work. Distributors are more optimistic that ground conditions will have improved by late next week. In the meantime, postings still are cited at $460-480/st FOB, but expectations are that most business will be completed at the low end of this range.
POTASH

MOP
US: Potash imports up 30% in Jan-Feb
The US imported 1.0 million mt of potash in February, 43% more than the same month a year earlier and the highest February imports since 2010, according to GTIS data.
The figures bring US year-to-date imports to 2.0 million mt, a 30% increase on Jan-Feb 2013 levels.
Canadian producers sent 774,944 mt to the US in February, with 221,163 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.
The US also imported 107,191 mt from Uralkali, 66,175 mt from BPC, 34,945 mt from SQM and 24,610 mt from ICL.
Total US imports reached 10.5 million mt of potash in 2014, 10% (1 million mt) more than in 2013. After tonnage was re-exported through Portland, net imports were 8.0 million mt.
Canada: Potash exports at 3.0 million mt in Jan-Feb
Canada exported 1.5 million mt of potash in February, a 32% increase on February 2014 and the largest February exports since 2005, according to GTIS data.
As a result, Canada has now exported 3.0 million mt of potash in the year to date, 28% more than the same period in 2014.
The country exported 774,944 mt to the US in February, with 221,163 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.
Including the exports from Portland, in February Canpotex exported 189,992 mt to Indonesia, 164,098 mt to China, 124,328 mt to Brazil, 72,393 mt to Malaysia and 58,121 mt to India.
Canada exported 17.3 million mt of potash in 2014, a 7.8% increase on the previous year and the largest yearly potash exports from the country since 2007. The country exported 9.2 million mt to the US in 2014, of which 2.5 million mt was re-exported out of the US from Portland.
US Midwest: Seasonal pricing for potash appears set
After some discounting earlier this season, granular potash values appear to have found firm footing a few dollars either side of $400/st FOB in the Midwest.
This level likely will be challenged in coming weeks, as distributors are expected to cut values in order to end the season empty. This is due to the prevailing view that crop prices will decline in coming months, bringing pressure on all input costs for the fall season.
US Southern Plains: After last week's start, field work slowed by more rain
Granular potash and other products still are being applied on higher ground in Oklahoma and Arkansas, but further rain this week cut into the trend towards greater field work seen last week. Texas still is seing good activity, and corn sowing is underway in that state.
Quotes for granular potash are $390-395/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River.

Canada: Vancouver FOB levels assessed lower on notional netbacks but indications scarce
Vancouver FOB prices were assessed considerably lower week on week based on international CFR prices, although firm indications could not be obtained.
Over recent weeks, it has been reported that sellers were not considering bids below $170/mt FOB. But with this FOB price above even CFR prices available in any region, it is clear that this would be an unrealistic expectation.
Pending further confirmation of price levels, values have been assessed at an indicative $140-150/mt FOB Vancouver, though most believe that sellers would in fact have to offer below $140/mt FOB to move volumes given current prices elsewhere.

SULPHURIC ACID
US: February imports climb as European volumes high
US imports of sulphuric acid for February were up 13% year on year to 275,985 mt.
Canada was the source of the majority of February tonnes, supplying 140,126 mt. This was followed by Mexico, which supplied 56,143 mt.
European countries were the source of more acid imports than usual, with 24,038 mt from Germany, 19,315 mt from Finland, 18,927 mt from Sweden, and 17,001 mt from Poland.
This marks the highest monthly volume from Germany since June 2011, from Finland since June 2009, and from Poland since April 2014.
Canada: February sulphuric acid exports decline 16.6%
Canada's February exports of sulphuric acid declined 16.6% year on year to 140,148 mt.
As is typical, effectively all of the exports went to the US.
NEWS
AGRICULTURE
US: First US progress report finds positives for wheat crop, field work overall
It is too early to expect to get a read on spring corn and soybean planting, but the first federal Crop Progress report of the new US spring season provided about as much good as bad news for the first week of April.
The most positive indicator for farm income was the overall US average reported condition for winter wheat. Surveys of the 18 key states for that crop completed April 5 by the US Department of Agriculture show 44% of the winter wheat rated good or excellent, a significant improvement over last year’s finding of 35% for the same period.
The US sorghum crop, forecast by the USDA to increase by 11% (about 750,000 acres) this crop year compared to last year, has not had a fast start this spring, with just 9% of the crop planted versus 15% for the five-year average. Cotton too is off to a slow start, with just 2% of the crop in the ground versus 6% for the five-year average as of April 5.
As noted there was no measurable data for corn or soybeans provided by USDA last week, but there was positive news from the surveys of some of the key corn-growing states. The percentage of days suitable for fieldwork in much of the Midwest was higher or roughly even with last year, the agency report said. The Dakotas also saw a greater percentage of days suitable for field work.
Perhaps the most negative news for growers came from California, with regard to the drought hammered state’s subsoil moisture. USDA’s most recent survey found 35% of the state’s subsoil was “very short” of moisture and the condition of 50% of the state was defined as “short.” The national average subsoil moisture level was defined as very short for only 15% of surveyed areas and short for just 25%.

Canada: K+S gets port facility permit for Legacy
K+S Potash Canada has received a permit to construct its port facility in Port Moody, British Columbia, where potash from the Legacy project will be shipped.
Pacific Coast Terminals received the permit to modify its existing facility at Port Moody to accommodate volumes of potash from the Legacy mine, Saskatchewan newspaper The StarPhoenix reports.
The facility at Port Moody will have the capacity to hold more than 150,000 mt of potash and major construction is set to start in the next few weeks.
Completion of the construction is set to coincide with the opening of the Legacy mine in 2016. Legacy is projected to reach two million mt of production capacity by the end of 2017.
In April 2014, Pacific Coast Terminals and K+S Potash Canada signed a long-term agreement for the storage and handling of potash from Legacy.
