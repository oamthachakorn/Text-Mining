Market Summary
DoF halts Indian MOP imports
It emerged late this week that India’s Department of Fertilizers (DoF) has stopped the movement of imported MOP from ports and domestic stores, amid mounting stocks and low domestic demand. At present, domestic stocks total up to 1mn t and a further 400,000t were forecast to arrive during February and March. But these will likely be deferred, effectively halting further first quarter imports. The unsold stock and deferred shipments will be subject to the new subsidy as of the second quarter, which is expected to be lower. The measure is widely reported but yet to be confirmed by the Indian government.
Officially there has been no progress with 2016 Chinese con- tract talks and now this market is heading into the New Year and Spring Festival holidays. NPK plants are already shut down and no activity is expected over the coming weeks. With China and India, the two largest standard MOP markets, effectively out for the time being there is increased pressure on suppliers to cut production. As reported, several have already taken action.

Prices
**- Estimated netback from cfr contracts in India
***- Estimated netback from cfr contracts in China
Elsewhere MOP spot prices have mostly traded lower or sideways. In northwest Europe, MOP seasonal demand should be evident, but as yet, buyers are content to wait and see. In the US demand is minimal, pushing price indications lower in Nola. Buyers do not foresee any supply issues in the short- term so remain absent from the market.
In Brazil, firm demand is limited and price indications have edged down again. A trade has been reported this week at a price understood to be around $240/t cfr Brazil, but below this level is also achievable. Some price stability has emerged this week in Malaysia and Indonesia, however, aided by strengthening local currencies compared to the US dollar.
With India and China both out for now, Indonesian and Ma- laysian tender buying drawing to a close, demand in the US and Brazil showing no signs of improving, the global market looks set for a quiet period over the short-term. Chinese contract talks should start in March, but when they will conclude is anyone’s guess.

DoF restricts MOP movement
The DoF has stopped the movement of imported MOP within the country.
The restriction, which is yet to be confirmed by the Indian government, prevents sales from ports and domestic stores, according to market participants.
An estimated 400,000t of MOP arrivals in February-March could now be deferred, effectively halting imports for the remainder of the first quarter. Around 286,000t of MOP ar- rived in January.
India has high MOP stocks and weak demand at present, so the move could be targeted at preventing more stock build- ing.
Any unsold imported MOP is now likely to be subject to a re- vised subsidy rate, which is due to be announced early in the second quarter for the 2016-17 fertilizer year. The current subsidy rate for MOP is 9,300 rupees/t ($137/t), but the new rate is expected to be lower.
The volume of MOP potentially impacted by the restriction on product movement is difficult to estimate, as it is unclear how much has already been sold. MOP stocks at India's ports are estimated at around 150,000t. Total MOP stocks — in- cluding those in ports, warehouses and already held in the field — are estimated at up to 1mn t.
The restriction on product movement also impacts imported DAP and NPKs.
China
Domestic activity is winding down ahead of the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival next week. Downstream NPK plants have already closed and potash demand remains weak overall. High stocks are also evident following the 9.4mn t of MOP imports that arrived in 2015. Formal discussions for the 2016 annual contract are expected to commence in March.
BPC has been checking freight for 65,000t of MOP, load- ing mid-February for shipment to two-ports China, but the supplier reports to be moving product to warehouse for re- distribution within Asia. This follows a similar freight enquiry circulated by Uralkali last week, which also said no new Chinese business was behind it.
Domestic market
QHSL continues to offer its 60pc crystal MOP at Yn 2,080/t delivered (including 13pc VAT). The price of Russian pink MOP has declined Yn 40/t to around Yn 1,960/t ex-warehouse at major ports but no new sales are heard.
On SOP, Luobupo is offering its 51pc powder at Yn 2,300/t delivered, while Mannheim producers are still nearer Yn 2,500/t exw for 50pc powder.

Nepal
Nepal’s Agriculture Inputs Company Limited (AICL) will close a tender on 15 February for 5,000t of MOP.
Malaysia
The most recent plantation tender awards have taken place at around 1,150 ringgit/t fot bagged. While the fot level has eased slightly, the recent firming of the ringgit against the US dollar has maintained equivalent cfr levels in the mid/ high-$250s/t before costs. Certain suppliers talk of higher equivalent levels nearer $260-270/t cfr. The ringgit was trad- ing at 4.12:$1 close to press time, compared with 4.35:$1 a month ago.
Among recent awards, IOI is understood to have purchased a total of 38,000t of standard MOP at around 1,150 ringgit/t fot bagged under its recent requirement for various fertilizer products. Confirmation on the buy side was not available.
The tender season for delivery during the first half of 2016 is winding down with most of the major buying now complete. One exception is Felda which continues to negotiate its 150,000t requirement, according to latest reports.
Many offices will be closed next week for the Chinese New Year. The next round of buying will start during the second half of May for delivery during the second half of 2016.
Local distributors believe total MOP purchasing for the first half of 2016 has been down between 10-25pc on a normal year. The main reasons are plantations trying to reduce costs in light of current crude palm oil (CPO) levels. The declining price trend of MOP has also contributed to a lesser extent.
Close to press time, CPO was trading at around 2,530 ringgit/t on the Bursa Malaysia. This compared to around 2,480 ringgit/t at a similar time last week.
Indonesia
As in Malaysia, substantial buying for the current tender sea- son is now complete. Local price indications remain around Rp 4,700/kg fot bagged including VAT. This now reflects around the low/mid-$280s/t cfr before costs, following the recent strengthening of the Indonesian rupiah against the US dollar.
Several buyers bought first quarter 2016 quantities rather than first half, as a way to limit exposure to falling prices. These buyers are expected to return to the market in March.

Japan
Fourth quarter 2015 MOP imports were down 18pc year-on- year at 116,787t, according to GTIS data. SOP imports during the fourth quarter also fell to 15,937t from 25,346t during the same period of 2014.
The recent decline in MOP and SOP imports is mostly attrib- uted to weaker domestic demand from the downstream NPK sector. Farmers are keen to reduce costs and are expected to limit NPK usage this coming rice season. Also NPK prices are expected to fall in the next pricing period that runs from June-October, following the movement of raw materials, so there is an incentive to limit stocks.
For the full year, MOP imports totalled 494,113t in 2015, down 8pc year-on-year. Canada was the leading supplier at 346,959t, but this was also down 11pc. SOP imports totalled 92,667t in 2015, up 4pc year-on-year. This was led by Ger- man supplies at 38,049t which rose 30pc year-on-year.
application delayed and this could impact buying. Certain suppliers continue to target prices in the €270s/t cfr equiva- lent, but indications equivalent to just below €270/t cfr/cif are also available in the market.
France
MOP demand is minimal and indications are up to around
€10/t lower than in Benelux markets. There is a lot of uncer- tainty at the dealer level, partly because of the falling price of urea, and this is encouraging a wait and see attitude.
Spain
Buyers expect a price reduction of around €10/t imminently but, as yet, suppliers are holding firm. Granular MOP remains priced at €300-310/t delivered, reflecting €275-285/t cif port, with standard MOP around €10-20/t cheaper. Russian and Israeli standard MOP are among expected upcoming imports.
Europe
In the main, potash purchasing is hand to mouth with many opting to wait until nearer application. Wet weather condi- tions across much of northern Europe have also deterred buying. Granular MOP prices have traded steady or slightly lower but easing freight rates and a firming euro have sup- ported fob netbacks.
Turkey
Standard MOP is offered in the mid-$260s/t cfr including 90 days’ credit, with buyers targeting below $260/t cfr.
During February, BPC will ship 4,000t of standard MOP to Al- pates and 3,000t of standard MOP to Ege Gubre ex-Nikolaev. These were booked in December with shipment delayed from January.
Germany
It is understood that K+S raised its KornKali price by €4/t for February to €244/t cif inland. A €4/t increase is scheduled for March and another €4/t increase for April.
Granular MOP is indicated by certain sellers at €280-285/t fca Antwerp/Ghent to German customers.
UK
Granular MOP remains priced at £220-225/t fca bagged, reflecting the €260s/t cif port before costs.
Benelux
Suppliers are still waiting to see if farmers step in for MOP this month as is traditional. But wet field conditions may see

US
Nola barge prices have dipped to $210-220/st fob as delayed demand persists and continues to pressure prices. This would reflect an average of $231/t cfr US Gulf.
Supply is ample, so buyers do not fear MOP shortages if winter logistics issues occur. Moreover, interior warehouse movement remains limited as farmers delay buying.
Some sellers are hopeful of renewed buying interest at a major industry event next week in Florida, but at present, the outlook remains weak.
Latin America
Brazil
BPC has sold 24,000t of granular MOP to an importer for February shipment. The price was not disclosed, but un- derstood to be around $240/t cfr. A vessel was fixed to Rio Grande, loading 5-10 February in Klaipeda, at a price around $11/t.
There are also price indications in the $230s/t cfr, but limited firm buying interest to test them. Overall demand remains weak and many suppliers remain out of the spot market, reportedly refusing to entertain the lowest numbers evident. Local sources talk of substantial MOP carryover stocks from 2015 into 2016, illustrating the lack of domestic MOP consumption of recent months.

The severe drought conditions will impact fertilizer con- sumption for the next season, suppliers predict. Many farm- ers are struggling with debt and the country is now focused on importing massive amounts of maize to cover the domes- tic shortfall in production and avoid food shortages.
For November and December 2015, MOP imports totalled 69,994t, almost half the 124,839t that were imported a year earlier, according to GTIS data. More recent figures are ex- pected to show a similar reduction when released, importers fear.

Agriculture NEws
French rapeseed prices continue decline
French rapeseed prices dropped in January to their low- est point for 12 months, pressured by strong harvests from competitors and increased imports.
Fob prices for French rapeseed at the country's northern inland port of Rouen fell in January to €353.50/t, from €371.17/t in December, according to the agriculture minis- try's statistics service Agreste.
Compared with January 2015, rapeseed prices at Rouen were up from €348.25/t.
Prices had staged a recovery in 2015 after falling by close to 40pc between September 2012 and September 2014 because of a strong set of harvests in major rapeseed producing countries and falling demand from France's dominant bio- diesel producer, Groupe Avril.
France's harvest is on course for around 5.3mn t in 2015- 16, according to ministry estimates, having largely resisted problems stemming from an EU ban on neonicotinoid pesti- cides.
The majority of the French harvest is reported by farmers in July and August. Some 3.9mn t was reported in the first five months of collection between July and December, down from 4.09mn t in the same period in the 2014-15 harvest. Some smaller volumes are harvested over the rest of the year, as well as quantities that are reported late by smaller farmers and rural co-operatives.
Strong harvests outside France means French imports of rapeseed are at a record high, further eating into price support. Between July and November — the latest available ministerial data — France imported 762,000t of rapeseed, up from 393,000t in the same period in 2014 and the highest level for the period on records that go back to 1995.
