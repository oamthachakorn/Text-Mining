UREA
NORTH AMERICA
Mexico: First-half 2015 imports up further
Arrivals of urea from offshore sources to Mexico in the first half of 2015 reached 783,000 mt, an increase of 23% on the same period in 2014.
This was despite June imports of 214,000 mt that were down by 4.8% on June 2014. June 2015 arrivals from China were down by 14% to 85,000 mt and shipments originating in Russia of 55,000 mt were down by 49%. UAE arrivals were 52,000 mt, up from zero in June 2014, and Ukraine also reappeared with 21,000 mt.
China accounted for 338,000 mt in the first half of 2015, up by 42.4% on the prior year and arrivals from Russia were up by 16% to 337,000 mt. UAE arrivals were limited to the tonnage identified above while Ukrainian deliveries of 43,000 mt were down from 64,000 mt in H1 2014.
US NOLA: Barges rebound after liquidation sales
Last week's sharp drop in the US Gulf ultimately included discounted offers from multiple suppliers in the low $260s/st FOB New Orleans. However, what some saw as a panic driven only by a lack of contract barge
freight exhausted itself by late September 4. Early this week granular urea barges had changed hands at prices nearly $10/st above last week's lows.
The new sales are returning $270-273/st FOB to sellers. However, the forward market is more cautious. Bids for physical positions for December were as low as $265/st FOB New Orleans, with business confirmed at $268/st FOB.
Some liquidation pricing often occurs ahead of the annual closure of the upper Mississippi River system in the US, but many traders with business served from the Arkansas River or by rail in to northern states see current values as a buying opportunity. By comparison, granular urea prices one year ago at New Orleans were over $353/st FOB.
US Midwest: Prices move down, sales up
Granular urea is moving well on a prompt and a forward basis in the US Midwest, as distributors have moved prices down in recent days and weeks to reflect lower replacement costs.
At midweek, granular urea was moving well from St. Louis at $300/st FOB and from the Twin Cities at
$305/st FOB. Distributors see little down-side risk, and the new-crop outlook still substantially favours corn over soybeans, potentially creating more nitrogen demand in the region than last year.
Canada: Imports down while exports increase
Canadian imports of urea in July were a mere 6,600 mt, according to customs data via GTIS. This was down from 131,000 mt in July 2014.
January-July imports of 403,300 mt were down by 29.6% with the US taking the biggest hit with deliveries down by 53.2% to 128,500 mt.
Arrivals from Germany and Russia of about 62,000 mt each were down by 4% and 11.9%, respectively. Arrivals from Bahrain were up from zero to 32,200 mt.
Canadian urea exports in July reached 105,100 mt, and increase of 17.2% on July 2014. This lifted January-July exports to 728,000 mt, an increase of 30% on the same period in 2014. Essentially all exports were destined for the US.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Central America: Trammo books Incofe
The September 4 Incofe tender for 30,000 mt urea plus 10,000 mt AN for October loading was booked by Trammo for loading from the Baltic.
The importer declined to reveal pricing in the deal, but local reports indicate that the urea traded at $283/mt CFR while the AN was suggested booked around $225/mt CFR.
Freight for the combination to discharge in Guatemala and Nicaragua is assessed around $28/mt, indicative of a return to Trammo below $255/mt FOB for the urea and around $195/mt FOB for the AN with no provisions for a margin.
Brazil: Granular urea values approach $280/mt CFR
Recent trades in granular urea of Middle East origin into Brazil are reported marginally above $280/mt CFR, down further on last week's $282-285/mt CFR assessment.
Sales at $281-282/mt CFR reflect Middle East netbacks at an even $260/mt FOB, significantly below most recent targets set by producers, but in line with returns available from other contract markets such as Thailand where delivered numbers are sliding below $280/mt CFR.
Chile: Imports from China dominate
Chilean urea imports in July of 73,000 mt were up by 52.6% on July 2014 according to data from customs via GTIS. China accounted for the full volume.
January-July imports a shade short of 255,000 mt were up by 14.1% on the same months in 2014, with China accounting for a full 225,600 mt, up by 42.7%. Arrivals from Malaysia were up from zero to 27,500 mt while supplies from Venezuela dropped from 46,000 mt to zero.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Yuzhnyy prills available despite cuts
Prilled urea is still available for September loading from Yuzhnyy despite the turnarounds and closurtes at DnieproAzot and OPZ.
Offers from producers and marketers are maintained at or even above $270/mt FOB, but these fail to generate purchasing interest in a market where traders need to cover at $260/mt to generate a margin on sales to Turkey.
Offers to Turkish importers are suggested available at $275/mt CFR with credit, implying netbacks around $255/mt FOB.
Limited availability and limited demand is also reflected in the lineup for September, which so far stands at a mere 36,000 mt despite the large Trammo cargo for Brazil:
Russia: First half 2015 urea exports down 16.75%
Russian exports of urea in the first six months of 2015 were 2.35 million mt, down by 16.75% on the H1 2014 volume.
Shipments to Brazil were nevertheless up by 8.9% to 546,000 mt, while deliveries to the US of 306,400 mt were down by 12.5%. Germany and Peru accounted for 187,000 mt and 137,000 mt, down by 18% and 24.2%, respectively. Deliveries to Ukraine were off by 4.3% to 116,000 mt while Turkey dropped by 51% to 106,000 mt.
June shipments of 601,400 mt were 5.6% ahead of the prior year with the US in the lead with 148,200 mt, up from 38,500 mt in June 2014. Deliveries to Brazil of 132,000 mt were up by 47% and the 51,000 mt shipped to Peru in June 20156 were up from zero in June 2014.
EUROPE
France: Granular urea trades lower
Multiple trades in granular urea are reported this week around the €280/mt FCA marker, and distributors suggest that firm bids some €2-4/mt lower would likely trigger acceptances on the part of sellers.
A €278/mt FCA deal would equate to about $298/mt CFR with no provisions for storage costs, financing and margin. This would in turn provide sellers of Egyptian granular urea with netbacks around $270/mt FOB, also without margin.
Turkey: Prices drop while imports increase
Following numerous sales around the $285/mt CFR marker with credit as reported last week, Turkish importers are now suggesting that offers for larger cargoes are available down to $275/mt CFR, also with credit. The identity of the trader offering at the purported number was however not revealed.
Imports of urea in July of 105,300 mt were meanwhile down by 25.6% on July 2014, but the January-July volume of 1.02 million mt was up by 14.4% on the prior year.
Ukraine retained the lead for the first seven months with 436,000 mt, up by 30%, while arrivals from Iran were up by 102% to 279,000 mt. Arrivals from Russia of 114,000 mt were down by 56% while shipments originating in China of 53,500 mt were up from a mere 2,200 mt. Deliveries of
44,500 mt from Bahrain were up from zero and
Croatian arrivals of 31,000 mt were up by 101%. Romanian shipments of 9,500 mt were down from 59,000 mt in the prior year.
Russia captured the number one spot in July with 42,400 mt, followed by Ukraine with 37,700 mt. Libya reappeared with 14,200 mt while arrivals in July from Iran of 8,200 mt were down from 74,000 mt in July 2014.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
South Africa: Imports up in July, but Jan-Jul lags
South African importers took delivery of 103,100 mt urea in July 2015, an increase of 67.4% on July 2014. Arrivals from Saudi Arabia of 48,500 mt were up by 197%. Russian deliveries via own ports were 24,500 mt and a further 16,500 mt shipped via the Baltic were registered as Estonian material.
The January-July volume of 299,600 mt was nevertheless down by 4.3% on the same period in 2014. Arrivals from Qatar were however up by
17.2% to 123,400 mt while Saudi Arabia accounted for 76,500 mt, a drop of 19%.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Suppliers busy formulating IPL strategy
The September 11 IPL tender for an unspecified quantity of urea to load by October 11 will undoubtedly attract significant selling interest, and speculation on prices likely obtainable by the importer is rife.
Chinese urea will feature prominently, but recent aggressive quotes from traders offering Middle East product in Brazil are indicative of offers into India well below current targets around $270/mt FOB from China and other producers in the region.
Recent Brazilian trades into the very low $280s/mt CFR provided netbacks to the Middle East no higher than $260-262/mt FOB, and returns from contract markets such as Thailand are similar. US netbacks were also similar, but the minor September 8 spike in New Orleans barge values could be indicative of better returns in the short term.
Should Middle East producers opt to offer at similar numbers in India, this would suggest possible quotes from regional suppliers to IPL marginally below $275/mt CFR East Coast India (ECI) as requested by IPL for the session. This is basis freight around $10/mt, limited transaction costs, and relatively small margin to intermediaries where applicable. Mainstream quotes will be higher, but IPL will follow the traditional path of countering basis the lowest offers received. Iranian product is expected to feature at similar numbers, if not lower, for around 250,000 mt.
The low end indicated would reflect returns just below $264/mt FOB China or Indonesia/Malaysia with limited provisions for costs and no margin. Freight from a fast port in northern China to ECI is assessed around $9/mt on a discharge rate of 10,000 mt/day, sundays and holidays included.
Offers and awards in recent tenders in Sri Lanka reflected netbacks to sellers of Chinese material well into the $260s/mt FOB, but these sessions permitted shipment through October and thus left room for traders to more confidently short the forward market. The strict October 11 shipment deadline imposed by IPL renders speculative offers at low numbers less likely to secure cover with a margin, given the recent depletion of inventories via shipments to MMTC.
While pressure to relieve existing inventories and disposing of September plus early October production in China will be considerable, the level suggested may be termed too low by Chinese producers now faced with an estimated $3/mt increase in costs due to the imposition of VAT. This cost is however largely offset by the lower value of the RMB. This provides increased returns in RMB terms, and may therefore not leave the door wide open for Iran and traditional Middle East suppliers to book a considerable volume with IPL.
Tonnage from the FSU is not expected to feature at the low end suggested in the above. Freight and costs for supramax carriers from the Black Sea are assessed marginally above $22/mt, necessitating cover around $250/mt FOB to compete. Given September turnarounds and outage issues at DnieproAzot and OPZ plus likely sustained cuts in half of Group DF output, Ukrainian product will instead head for nearby markets, and Russian producers are also expected to seek better returns via alternative outlets.
India: Imports through June up significantly
Indian imports of urea registered by customs via GTIS in June of 342,400 mt were up by 124% on the volume imported in June 2014. Oman accounted for 174,000 mt and deliveries from Iran were 120,000 mt.
The June arrivals lifted first-half calendar year 2015 imports to 4.02 million mt, up by 57% on the first half of 2014. Arrivals from China of 2.45 million mt were up by 71% while the 1.04 million mt shipped from Oman were up by 13.3%. Iranian producers enjoyed the largest relative increase via shipments of 474,000 mt that were up by 258% on 2014.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Thailand: Prices slide in slow market
Granular urea demand in Thailand remains subdued, and offers for prompt positions of Middle East material are now suggested available to importers at $278/mt CFR. This follows recent trades at an even $280/mt CFR.

NORTH AMERICA
US S. Plains: AN unmoved in recent weeks
Neither the price nor truckloads of ammomium nitrate have moved in recent weeks, with untested postings sitting around $310-320/st FOB along the Arkansas River.
US Atlantic Coast: Gavilon to discharge UAN at Norfolk
Gavilon will discharge 23,000 mt of UAN-32 at Norfolk, Virginia around mid October. The cargo
was purchased from Abu Qir this week at $183/mt FOB. This indicates a cost in the tank of about $205/st FOB with no margin.
Recent truck and rail sales of UAN from the US East Coast were cited at $6.72-7.03/unit FOB, which suggests at least a $10/st margin for the product.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Central America: Trammo books Incofe
The September 4 Incofe tender for 10,000 mt AN plus 30,000 mt urea for October loading was booked by Trammo for loading from the Baltic.
The importer declined to reveal pricing in the deal, but local reports indicate that the AN traded at $225/mt CFR while the urea was suggested booked around $283/mt CFR.
Freight for the combination to discharge in Guatemala and Nicaragua is assessed around $28/mt, indicative of a return to Trammo around $195/mt FOB for the AN and below $255/mt FOB for the urea with no provisions for margin.

Belarus: GrodnoAzot closes another UAN tender
GrodnoAzot closed an export tender for 10,000 mt UAN-32 on September 9 for October shipment. No further details were available at press time.
The supplier's 25,000 mt sale to Ameropa at $184-185/mt FOB under its August 31 tender is headed for Canada.

Egypt: Abu Qir sells 23,000 mt to Gavilon
Abu Qir has awarded Gavilon its September 9 tender for 23,000 mt of UAN at $183/mt FOB for September 14-17 lifting. Freight for shipment to the US East Coast is estimated at $37/mt providing delivered values around $220/mt CFR with the Ardmore Chinook in the frame for the voyage. Most or all of the cargo is expected to discharge in Norfolk, Virginia.

FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Tight availability prevails with higher price quotes
Black Sea ammonia availability is tight with little cargo if anything available for September lifting. As such suppliers stress that prices can no longer be below $390/mt FOB.
NF Trading denies the sale of cargoes to Trammo for lifting on the Navigator Grace and Marycam Swan at the end of this month, claiming ammonia is being withheld possibly for use as a feedstock when Group DF restarts nitrogen production at Ukranian facilities CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot. The units produce urea and ammonium nitrate (AN) and have been shut since May 2015.
OPZ confirmed it stopped production of ammonia and urea on September 8 owing to technical issues reported by its supplier of natural gas, with no gas being fed to the facility. The outage is expected to last one week.
Early estimates predict ammonia and urea output will both decrease by one-third for September. This comes as one of OPZ’s two ammonia lines is under a 30-day maintenance shutdown which began at the end of August.
Meanwhile, it emerged that Ameropa will charter the Clipper Neptun from Koch for 60 days during October/November as its vessels the Gas Cobia and the Gas Manta go into drydock for 10-14 days. The likelihood it that she will be used as a mid-size vessel for contract commitments west of Suez, rather than being filled to her 40,000 mt capacity.
Ameropa has also chartered the Odin vessel for at least three years to replace the Cambridge which has been fixed for a similar period in the LPG market from Q4, 2015.
EUROPE
Turkey: Strong July imports with more Algerian cargoes
Turkish ammonia imports in July 2015 reached 48,583 mt, an increase of 43% y-o-y on increased off-take from Ukraine and Algeria during the month.
Total Turkish imports for the January to July period reached 311,837 mt, a decline of 8%.
Turkey imported the majority of its ammonia from Russia during the first seven months of this year at 191,073 mt, a 43% increase y-o-y.
Imports from the Ukraine over the period were 78,397 mt, a decrease of 26%. Off-take from Algeria was 23,361 mt, up from zero in the previous year.

India: FACT awards tender to Trammo at $505/mt CFR
FACT confirmed it has issued an award to Trammo for 7,500 mt at $505/mt CFR with 180 days credit terms following its 15,000 mt import tender which closed on September 3.
No offers were submitted for the first 7,500 mt parcel requested to arrive on or before October 5. Trammo's offer for the second 7,500 mt lot to arrive in Cochin October 11-15 was accepted.
The $505/mt CFR price tag with credit equates to around $490/mt CFR after deduction of interest, discounting charges and other costs. This represents an increase of $17/mt on the August 24 tender award to CIFC on tightening supply east of Suez.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Taiwan: CPDC acrylonitrile plant in early maintenance
CPDC said its downstream acrylonitrile plant will be taken down for maintenance from early October for three
weeks, reducing the buyer’s ammonia consumption next month.
The shutdown had originally been scheduled towards the end of October but given the very weak acrylonitrile market this was brought forward.
The buyer still pegs contract values around $460/mt CFR with Mitsui discharging 5,000 mt late September off the Gas Quantum and Gas Serenity respectively.
South Korea: SFC still negotiating spot purchase
SFC continues to discuss the potential purchase of 15,000 mt for second half October arrival with a trader. There is reported to be a $20/mt gulf between the buyer and seller regarding cargo pricing with SFC seeking $460/mt CFR or below.
Namhae has no current spot requirements with a steady stream of cargo deliveries. Yara will discharge 10,000 mt off the Viking River September 15-16 following a spot deal concluded mid-August. Trammo will discharge 15,000 mt off the Tobolosk September 19 under contract.
PHOSPHATES
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Pakistan: Limited scope for imports
The volume of confirmed DAP imports for calendar year 2015 to date is estimated at almost 650,000
mt. Added to this will be an Australian cargo for Chawla before the end of the year, details of which are not yet confirmed. In addition there are reports circulating of a Kailin cargo loading in China this month on the Ocean Kite.
The buyer of this particular cargo has not yet been confirmed and has generated numerous rumours.
Other reports discussed in the market this week have concerned the pricing of the United Agro cargo due to load with Dayakou product through Quantum at the weekend. The price has now been confirmed in the upper $470s-480/mt CFR level as the sale was concluded prior to the recent drop in price.
No cargoes have yet been confirmed as purchased in the $460s/mt CFR despite Fauji receiving offers sub $470/mt CFR against its most recent enquiry. The market has weakened with the Pakistan rupee depreciating by almost 3% over the past month leaving buyers' price ideas in the low-mid $460s/mt CFR. In addition global prices are weak and buyers are loathe to commit new tonnes while the price is on the decline.
With uncertainty over the subsidy, importers have also been reluctant to return to the market until the issue is clarified. The Prime Minister is expected to take a decision very soon as to whether to re-introduce the subsidy on DAP through a "deemed price mechanism" (see last report) or instead to increase support prices for crops or, as it did last year, to do nothing at all.
The outlook for demand going forward is looking less certain following a downward revision by the NFDC of estimated consumption for the current calendar year. A combination of low crop prices, in particular cotton and rice, an increase in the price of urea following increased gas costs to the domestic industry and uncertainty over the subsidy issue have reduced the scope for further imports.
Consumption of DAP for 2015 is estimated between 1.4-1.5 million mt which with production plus imports already at around 1.45 million mt, theoretically leaves little if any room for any significant quantities of imported DAP before the end of the year.
Nevertheless, there is still potential interest and both Fauji and Engro are expected to book further tonnes before the end of the year.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Domestic market supporting DAP price
The Chinese phosphate industry continues to evaluate the impact of the VAT introduced on September 1. At the same time, a steady stream of domestic deliveries are supplementing export loadings thereby relieving producers of any pressure to make new sales until later in the month for October shipment.
Official prices are still at or around the $460/mt FOB China but this does not reflect the real export price indications which have fallen in recent weeks in line with the depreciation in key Chinese DAP markets, namely India and Pakistan. Buyers in the latter market are quoting the low-mid $460s/mt CFR which would equate to the upper $440s/mt FOB China with a freight of around $17/mt. Chinese product has been on offer sub $470/mt CFR Kharachi, equating back to the low $450s/mt FOB China.
In India some buyers are quoting even lower numbers, in the low-mid $450s/mt CFR, giving a netback $10/mt or more below depending on freight rates.
These prices have not yet been done and most Chinese producers are not yet under pressure to agree such low numbers for September. Trader positions could be a different story but again nothing at the lower prices has yet been confirmed.
With domestic prices at RMB 2,600/mt ex works still equating to a $460/mt FOB if not more, the industry is loathe to reduce its official export price indications for fear of having to then reduce price levels to the domestic market during this current season.
Nevertheless lower prices are expected once the pull from the domestic market ceases and producers once again rely on the export market for business. Prospects for volume sales in both India and Pakistan are looking fairly dismal for Q4 with rabi consumption estimates in both markets revised down and this in itself could put pressure on Chinese prices.
The industry has attempted to pass on some or all of the additional cost from the VAT to the domestic market in the way of higher prices, raising ex-works prices for DAP by RMB 100/mt to RMB 2,700 however this has not been successful so far and prices remain unchanged.
With higher potash costs from the VAT, NPK prices are likely to increase. MAP prices are under pressure as demand from the NPK industry comes off slightly.
Indications for granular MAP for export, based on little or no demand, are said to be around $350/mt FOB for granular 11-44-0 and $400/mt for 10-50-0.

CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Chile: SQM increases SOP sales
Chile's SQM exported 68,000 mt SOP between January and July, more than double the 29,000 mt exported in the same period during 2014, according to GTIS data.
During the period SQM shipped 22,000 mt to Belgium, 13,000 mt to Brazil and 12,000 mt to Mexico.
In the company's recent H1 financial report it noted that revenues in its MOP/SOP division fell 26% to $220.4 million as volumes reduced 31%. MOP volumes took the brunt of reductions, while SOP volume increases and strong SOP prices during H1 helped limit the impact on revenues, the data show.

India: Potash imports up in July, down in fertilizer year
India imported 631,000 mt potash in July, an increase on 487,000 mt in the same month last year, according to FAI data.
However, total imports between April and July remain down roughly 200,000 mt at 1.3 million mt with April- June shipments down 300,000 mt during negotiations over new contracts to the region and the strike at ICL's Dead Sea Works.
In the first quarter of the fertilizer year India imported 737,000 mt of potash, according to GTIS data, which correlates with the FAI figures. BPC increased shipments to India between April and June to 261,000 mt from 164,000 mt previously, while Canpotex increased shipments to 146,000 mt from 129,000 mt, GTIS data show.
On the other hand, Uralkali reduced shipments to 197,000 mt during the quarter from 253,000 mt, according to GTIS, while ICL reduced its shipments to 48,000 mt from more than 200,000 mt due to the strike earlier this year. APC volumes increased slightly to 81,000 mt from 72,000 mt.
The rush of potash imports during July are believed to have continued into August, with sources saying that between 550,000 mt and 600,000 mt were imported during the month. If so, then imports for the first half of the fertilizer year are likely similar to slightly above the level imported last year.
Despite the larger volumes signed on yearly contracts earlier this year, current weak demand in India due to currency issues and deficient monsoon rains coupled with high stocks (404,500 mt at end July) has meant that the country may not surpass the 4.2 million mt imported during the fertilizer year 2014/15, but this depends on demand during the second half of the fertilizer year.
Rainfall deficiency is currently at 14.3% of the long period average, with some key southern states seeing deficiency of close to 40% giving serious concern for demand in the Rabi season.
SULPHUR
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Volumes still constricted by low river levels
Suppliers of Russian sulphur have reported that persistently low river levels continue to cause their cargo loadings to be around half of typical volumes, potentially constricting supply.
In addition, Russian availability will be further diminished in Q4 and Q1 during the northern winter season, as in previous years.
Russian sellers' negotiations for Q4 contract prices are likely to start later this month, according to sources.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: Spot sulphur inactive; Q4 talks imminent
Morocco is reportedly inactive on sulphur spot markets at present and an OCP source suggested that the buyer had a backlog of pending arrivals and was comfortable with stock levels.
However, the source said that the buyer was receiving offers at “competitive levels”.
Negotiations for Q4 North African contracts should commence this months, and a decline from Q3 levels is likely given broader price declines in global sulphur markets. Contract levels for Q3 are assessed at $145- 150/mt CFR.
SULPHURIC ACID
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Mosaic seeking 12,000 mt for November
Mosaic has entered the market with a tender for 12,000 mt sulphuric acid for delivery H2 November.
The tender closes September 11.
European sellers and traders have been waiting for Brazilian demand, as spot demand overall has been lacklustre in recent months. In addition, some recent Brazilian enquiries, including the previous Mosaic tender, were reportedly met by Chilean or Mexican supply.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Spot demand anticipated soon
The Indian sulphuric acid spot import market is currently quiet, though sources expect further spot demand in the near future.
Although some sources reported that Indian requirements for all buyers have been met for the next few weeks, others suggest that PPL and possibly CIL are expected to re-enter the market soon.
Spot price ideas from India were reportedly in the $45-50/mt CFR range, but other market participants suggested that the mid-$50s/mt CFR would be more realistic.
As previously reported, PPL in late August bought a cargo of around 11,000 mt for September delivery from Japan, and prices for the trade were reported from the high $50s/mt CFR to the low $60s/mt CFR range, above recent price ideas in the low-to-mid-$50s/mt CFR.
In addition, PPL’s sulphur burner is currently expected to run from late October following a series of delays, and this would lead to diminished demand for spot acid.
However, one seller noted that they had continued spot enquiry from buyers, including PPL, and that the buyer was also seeking greater volumes on its long-term contracts.

PEOPLE
Ponce resigns as chairman of SQM holding companies
Chilean potash producer SQM has recovered its share price on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by 24% in the last month, with recent gains following news that Julio Ponce has resigned from the boards of its parent companies.
In the twelve months leading until August 7 2015, SQM shares on the NYSE fell over 50%.
Ponce, former son-in-law of General Pinochet, resigned as director and chairman of the four holding companies in control of SQM for 'personal reasons', according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday, adding to speculation that he may relinquish all control over the mining company.
The resignation comes with SQM embroiled in a corruption investigation and dispute over its leases in the Atacama salt flat. SQM also saw an 18% fall in its revenues to $1.06 billion in H1 2015 due partly to reduced sales volumes.
Following a general meeting on April 24 SQM reshuffled its board amid allegations by Chilean authorities of tax evasion and corruption, Ponce stepped down after the company admitted evading taxes on $11 million in payments.
Julio Ponce had chaired SQM since 1987 and has been a controversial figure due to his connections to ex- Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, fines for insider trading and scandals over illicit political campaign financing.

Togo awards $1.4 billion phosphate complex to Elenilto
Togo awarded a tender to develop a $1.4 billion phosphate complex in the West African nation to Elenilto, the group controlled by the Israeli billionaire Jacob Engel.
Elenilto controls the consortium and is cooperating on the project with Chinese phosphate producer Wengfu. A process is underway to secure financing for the complex, Elenilto said in a statement.
"The phosphate rock concentrates export of 3 million mt per year, the 500,000 mt per year of phosphoric acid production and 1.3 million tons per year of fertilizer products, shall allow an export of both phosphoric acid and fertilizers to Africa and the international market," the company said.
The execution of the final concession development agreement is expected this month, and the sales of concentrates production is expected to begin within 3 years.

Disclaimer:
While all reasonable efforts are taken to ensure the reliability of the fertilizer pricing and freight pricing data, FW does not guarantee its accuracy or take liability for the results obtained by using the data.
Using FW prices in contracts: Many subscribers to Fertilizer Week use Fertilizer Week benchmark prices in their contracts. When both sides in a business arrangement agree in advance to use a set of prices it creates more certainty and saves everyone time – as long as the prices can be relied upon. Fertilizer Week publishes a regularly updated methodology document with detailed definitions of every price we publish. By understanding how we calculate our prices, you will be able to build your own scenarios based on these prices
