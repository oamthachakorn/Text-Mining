ANALYSIS
Price stability continues as deal outcomes awaited
Sulphuric acid markets remained balanced and stable, with European sellers and traders awaiting the outcome of Brazilian deals while Asian sellers and traders continued to receive spot demand from India.
Petrobras is seeking offers for 60,000 mt towards its acid requirements this year as a possible alternative to its recent frequent purchases of 15,000 mt parcels. The buyer continues to wait for the startup of a refinery that was expected to help meet its acid requirements. In addition, Mosaic closed its latest 12,000 mt tender.
It is yet to be revealed whether European FOB and Brazilian CFR prices have changed at all from their stable levels of recent months, and these deals should provide further indications.
Morocco remains relatively inactive on sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced to as low as 30,000 mt/month and these requirements can be met by current long-term contracts.
In Asia, Indian spot prices continue to be pegged in the high $60s/mt CFR as demand from the country persists. Reports of a purchase by PPL in the low $50s/mt CFR were attributed to a swap whereby the buyer will have to resell the product at the same price, suggesting that the price is not representative of true spot levels.
Chinese import prices were also reportedly firm at $30-40/mt CFR, roughly in line with domestic prices.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s May exports of sulphuric acid doubled year on year to 296,090 mt, though the total for the first five months was still down 2.5% at 1.18 million mt. Record monthly volumes went to Thailand and Vietnam.
∙Petrobras seeks offers for 60,000 mt
∙Mosaic closes latest 12,000 mt tender
∙OCP reports lower spot requirement for coming months
∙Indian demand still firm in $60s/mt CFR
∙PPL reportedly gets tonnes on deal swap
∙South Korea's May exports double on record SE Asian volumes
Base Metals
Base metals fell further over the course of the week, as concerns over a potential Greek default on sovereign debt and a possible eurozone exit weighed heavily on prices. Some metals were seen as oversold, and a weakening dollar also offered hopes for some stability. LME copper was down to $5,748/mt for cash.
DAP & Sulphur
In theory summer spot phosphate cargoes should be lining up for the US Gulf, but there are no substantial volumes committed outside of a part cargo expected from EuroChem this month. This leaves Mosaic with little else to do but to run its plants and fill its consignment warehouses in the US interior, keeping all of its sulphuric acid in house. Meanwhile, the working assumption is that PotashCorp's closure of its sulphuric acid unit at Geismar, Louisiana, was accounted for by the market in prior months, but those expectations will be tested in coming weeks and months.
Global spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards March, with higher indications particularly from the Middle East and China. Tasweeq's latest 35,000 mt tender was heard awarded in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB, and Chinese deals were reported as high as $165/mt CFR.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices remain stable for the fifth consecutive week at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China, as sulphur and ammonia prices were largely unchanged and expectations of oversupply have been tempered slightly in recent months.
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Petrobras seeking 60,000 mt
Petrobras is seeking 60,000 mt of sulphuric acid towards its annual requirements, with bids due by June 23, sources said.
Petrobras needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.
Meanwhile, Mosaic closed its latest 12,000 mt tender June 18, though no prices were yet disclosed. The tonnes are for August delivery.
EUROPE
Europe: Spot stable and contracts yet to finalise
Spot prices for sulphuric acid exports from Europe remained stable at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with a lack of new reported business.
Upcoming Brazilian sales will give a clearer indication of any possible movement from price levels that have been stable for several months.
Moroccan spot demand is lacking, and although overall volumes to the US are strong, spot business has been limited.
Meanwhile, further indications of Q3 European contracts have yet to be revealed, although no great change is expected from Q2 levels.
Sweden: Q1 exports up 6.1% despite March drop
Sweden exported 120,006 mt of sulphuric acid in Q1 2015, up 6.1% year on year despite a 54.5% drop in March volumes.
Norway, Finland, the US and Morocco remained the four largest destinations for Q1, though their relative shares altered slightly.
Cuba took 10,500 mt after not receiving any volumes from Sweden in Q1 2014.
Spain: Q1 exports climb 31%
Spain’s sulphuric acid exports for Q1 were up 30.8% at 265,621 mt.
Chile has been the key destination for tonnes, taking 59,020 mt compared with 38,206 mt in Q1 2014.
The volumes going to Morocco increased to 49,955 mt from 12,602 mt, while tonnes to Cuba increased to 40,375 mt from 10,474 mt.
The US was the destination for 19,003 mt, up from nothing in Q1 2014.
Brazil, on the other hand, received only 15,019 mt of Spain’s Q1 exports, down from 60,967 mt.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP requirements currently met by contracts
Morocco remains relatively inactive on sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced considerably and are currently met by term contracts.
The buyer reports that its requirement has declined to around 30,000 mt/month, well below the levels that it has imported over the past year, which averaged around 80,000 mt/month. It is suggested that these requirements can be met by current long term contracts.
CRU expects Morocco’s imports for 2015 to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.
Morocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Demand still firm; PPL gets product in swap
Indian demand remained firm, with prices pegged mostly in the $65-70/mt CFR range.
PPL reportedly obtained a cargo from Japan, with prices reported in the $50s/mt CFR, surprising many market participants. However, one source suggested the deal was a swap whereby the consumer will have to resell the same volume to the seller at the same price at a later date.
Good demand from the SSP sector in India is supportive of prices, especially on the west coast.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan/South Korea: Spot prices steady
East Asian spot prices for export remain stable at an assessment of $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, with most recent business falling within this range.
Indian demand remains a key supporter of spot prices, with some smaller spot enquiries from Vietnam.
A lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi's Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko's Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc's Onahama smelter.
The PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc's Onsan smelter shut on May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days.
Much uncertainty centres on how much PASAR is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts. The plant has not yet resumed output.
Later in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters.
China: Import prices pegged $30-40/mt CFR
Sources continued to peg spot prices for Chinese sulphuric acid imports in the $30-40/mt CFR range.
Acid prices in southern China were reported at RMB 360/mt for industrial use, but Jinchuan Copper’s Fancheng smelter was selling at RMB 240/mt, roughly equivalent to the $40/mt CFR import price in the region, sources said.
Netbacks for exports to India from southern China were pegged below $30/mt FOB, making them unattractive for domestic producers.
South Korea: May exports double; records to SE Asia
South Korea’s May exports of sulphuric acid doubled year on year to 296,090 mt, though the total for the first five months was still down 2.5% at 1.18 million mt.
Of the May tonnes 70,339 mt went to China, meaning it remained the largest destination for South Korean exports, though this was the smallest monthly volume South Korea has sent there since December.
India took 67,736 mt, Thailand took 46,748 mt and Chile took 46,646 mt.
The Thailand volume is the largest monthly volume from South Korea to that country on record dating back to at least 1997.
Vietnam took 19,038 mt, and this was the largest volume on record to that country too.
A cargo of 25,300 mt went to Mexico, and this is believed to be from the previously reported LS Nikko combi vessel tender.
