ANALYSIS
Market dominated by expectations due to thin volume of trades
Most major suppliers are waiting for the calendar to bring importers in Brazil and India back to the marketplaces, leaving endusers in other markets to pick off cargoes offered by those producers feeling inventory pressure in the near term.
This enabled buyers to convince Russia's EuroChem to meet marketplace expectations for a DAP/MAP cargo for Argentina and to lead to further expectations that new business to Argentina/Uruguay would have to be even cheaper.
Traders working in Brazil's market said carryover sitting in warehouses in that country means any new spot cargoes would have to be priced at least $10/mt below current offer levels and it seems unlikely such business would do much more than lead to even lower price demands on subsequent shipments.
As previously reported, India's last round of buying has left it comfortable in the near term, especially given the drop in value of the rupee against the US dollar. As the Chinese domestic season for phosphate applications winds down towards the end of this month or early May, port inventories in that country are expected to embolden buyers for India to make bids below $480/mt CFR, especially if Saudi output is building. US export giant Mosaic may also participate with June cargoes, as returns at $480/mt CFR are not far below current US barge values.
If there is good news here for suppliers it is that low prices inevitably are the cure for low prices. India's clout means whatever price is concluded for that market typically sets the floor during Q2 and Q3 for global values. Other buyers can expect to see higher demands once Indian buying returns.
In the US domestic market, sales of imported DAP continue at a few dollars either side of $410/st FOB, the equivalent of $452/mt FOB US Gulf, suggesting Mosaic likely will come down to meet Brazilian expectations once pricing there is more settled. For now the producer is happy to holdout at a higher export indication until most of the US seasonal demand is met.
Highlights of the Week
•Argentina/Uruguay aim to pick off cheaper offers while others on side line
•Saudi continues to sell cargoes at top of range to India
•Rumours continue of US DAP cargoes for Q2-Q3 shipment to India
•SE Asia DAP sales completed across wide range
•European contract price talks for phosacid finally underway, maybe
Two key enduser markets, the US and China, will have met their seasonal demands in coming weeks. This will leave producers in those countries to consider their price demands primarily on the backs of how much DAP/MAP is worth in India and Brazil. While this should lead to lower prices in May, it should also set the stage for a rebound as those endusers sweep up the lowest priced DAP and MAP. The combination of international sales and empty domestic systems in the US and China should enable suppliers to seek higher prices later in the summer.

MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US Southern Plains: Flat while wet weather prevails
DAP is not moving in significant volumes so far this week, as much of the region outside of Texas is too wet for field work. Distributors are more optimistic that ground conditions will have improved by late next week. In the meantime, postings still are cited at $460-480/st FOB, but expectations are that most business will be completed at the low end of this range.
US New Orleans: Market divided between up-river, Gulf indications
Business has been done at $405-410/st FOB New Orleans this week for DAP barges discharging in the US Gulf, but barges already moving north have changed hands at $415-420/st FOB, according to some traders. Nevertheless, despite some bullishness for barges available off tows already moving along the Mississippi River system, bids are lower for load dates or barges still in the Gulf. Bids for these positions, albeit so far unsuccessful this week, have been made at $400-405/st FOB.
US Tampa: Brazil not interested in DAP/MAP offers, India rumours continue
Mosaic reported no new export trade this week, following last week when the only business cited by the producer was priced on a formula for Latin America. Expectations are that Mosaic and some other global producers are waiting for greater interest late next month from Brazil. In recent weeks Mosaic has little interest in competing for business in Argentina and other markets that will likely only lower price expectations further in key Brazilian trade.
Meanwhile, rumours persist that Mosaic is trying to build an export line-up to its own system in India and other importers in that country. Expectations are that the producer might load two large cargos through June, but so far Mosaic has declined to comment on the speculation. Likely returns from India given current prices in that country and the weakness in the prompt US market make India a reasonable alternative for the US producer in coming weeks.
In the meantime, the US Tampa benchmark likely is not better than $470/mt FOB, assuming small cargoes to Central America still could yield higher returns than are indicated for Brazil and elsewhere.
US: DAP and MAP arrivals jumped in February
Importers showed improved timing in February, bringing 95,639 st (86,763 mt ) of DAP and 28,427 st
( 25,789 mt) of MAP to the US just a few weeks ahead of the annual re-opening of the upper Mississippi River system, according to the US Department of Commerce. One year earlier February DAP arrivals were just 2,341 st (2,124 mt) and MAP imports totaled just 3,024 st (2,743 mt).
Almost all of February 2015's DAP imports and also all of the gain between the relevant months was credited to imports from Morocco of 60,186 st and Russia of 33,191 st. MAP imports were almost entirely concentrated in Russian hands in February 2015, with 24,771 st discharging from that country.
DAP arrivals during July-February also were up compared to the prior year period at 448,516 st (406,891 mt). China took the lion's share of this trade, with 282,224 st imported mostly during July-December. Russia supplied 76,485 st of DAP during July-February. MAP imports in the first eight months of the US fertilizer year through February were 904,090 st (820,185 mt), compared to 296,770 st (269,228 mt). International MAP suppliers to the US inclued Morocco at 326,597 st, China at 253,162 st and 236,845 st.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Bids and offers may remain far apart until May
Brazil's market is weighed down by carryover from the prior season, a weak domestic currency versus the US dollar and strikes in the transportation industries.
Bids and offers for new MAP and DAP cargoes in Brazil are at least $10/mt apart and neither buyers nor sellers expect to see that situation change until May, and new cargoes may not discharge before June in significant volumes.
Importers are looking to buy from US, Russian or North African suppliers at $465/mt CFR for MAP and DAP today, a value that likely will not be accepted by those sellers in the near term. Offers are suggested at $475/mt CFR for now, and Chinese material is indicated even higher.
Argentina/Uruguay: Trader buys DAP/MAP cargo, price tags still inching down
EuroChem sold 20,000 mt MAP and 20,000 mt DAP on a single cargo to load for Argentina and Uruguay in April.
While details are sparse, a previous purchase by Profertil below $480/mt CFR suggests this latest business was around $475/mt CFR for both products. This indicates a return to EuroChem of about $445/mt FOB whether it loads from the Black Sea or the Baltic, and assuming a margin for the trader involved, rumoured to be Nitron.
While EuroChem still has some April availability, a planned turnaround at its Kingisepp plant in May will limit forward availability, and may allow it to focus on its higher-priced customers in Europe, rather than selling further afield in the coming weeks.
EUROPE
Europe: Europe DAP demand all but over
The DAP season over in France and the southern part of West Europe, and the end is approaching in Germany, though the season will continue through April for corn application.
Eurochem is expected to announce a new price for April but in the meantime DAP prices, almost exclusively Lithuanian, are holdiing in the range of $525-530/mt FCA Terneuzen.
Some limited demand for DAP in the local truck markets is reported.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Tunisia/Turkey: GCT and Gubretas still locked in DAP talks
As of last week GCT had not indicated anything firm for April pricing. With the European season almost over, the Tunisians are likely to be concentrating on talks with Turkish buyers.
As of last week, Morocco's OCP was indicating $515/mt FOB in Southern Europe, which may mean a deal close to $505-510/mt FOB is possible. GCT likely will aim to match the same range.
Saudi Arabia: Ma'aden and Sabic agree Indian sales
Ma'aden is now fully committed through April and early May after agreeing recent sales into India. Ma'aden sold a 30,000 mt DAP cargo to Kribcho in India at $489/mt CFR for delivery at the end of April.
A second cargo from the Saudi producer of about 35,000 mt was also sold into India at the same price for loading in the second half of April. Market sources suggest the buyer was IPL, though this could not be confirmed at the time of writing.
Ma'aden says it is now fully committed through April and early May but has received enquiries from May onwards from India, Pakistan, East Africa and South America. The company's last shipment to Latin America was to Yara and priced on a formula.
The seller last week indicated it was seeking $500/mt CFR for new business into Pakistan.
Under a recent MoU, Sabic sold a second DAP cargo to Zuari of 30-35,000 mt at about $485-86/mt CFR India with delivery expected by April 20. The first cargo of 30-35,000 mt was also priced similarly at $485- 486/mt CFR Mundra, according to sources, and arrived in the last week of March.
Ma'aden has now signed contracts with three Indian buyers for 700,000 mt to be delivered between April this year and March, 2016. The price will be negotiated before each shipment.
Morocco: OCP plans for Brazil still unclear
As reported last week, OCP plans to switch its attention to increased phosacid and NPS shipments through April.
Following on from last month's settlement of phosacid prices in India, OCP will now focus its attention on shipping increased volumes of acid from Morocco. It will ship reduced quantities of DAP/MAP in April while balancing granulation according to demand. The final three 50,000 mt NPS shipments for Ethiopia will be loaded through April/May along with additional NPKs for Nigeria and West Coast Africa, as detailed in last week's report.
DAP/MAP production will be limited with just 20-30,000 mt allocated for the European market and nothing firm as yet for Brazil. Serious phosphate demand in Brazil is widely said to be 30-40 days away.
After loading 260,000 mt for the US in February/March, it is believed OCP plans no more US April shipments but has allocated 1-2 cargoes for Q2.
OCP indicated a price last week for DAP of $515/mt FOB for Europe.
Q2 discussions for phosphoric acid into the Northwest European market are expected to be taking place imminently.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Pakistan: Still no new DAP sales confirmed
Firming freights have meant producers have increased their price ideas for product delivered into Karachi.
Saudi's Ma'aden indicated last week it was seeking $500/mt CFR for new business in Pakistan.
India: Three April Saudi DAP cargoes confirmed
Some new business was reported this week to India from Saudi Arabia even as buyers awaited an annoucement on the new NBS rates.
Last year the NBS rates were announced on April 4 but not until May 2 in 2013.
Kribhco confirmed it purchased a 30,000 mt cargo of Saudi DAP from Ma'aden at $489/mt CFR for delivery at the end of April. A second Ma'aden cargo of about 35,000 mt was also sold into India at the same price for loading in the second half of April. Market sources suggest the buyer was IPL, though this could not be confirmed at the time of writing.
These two sales increase the top end of the DAP Bulk CFR India Spot price by $3/mt. The benchmark is now assessed at $480-489/mt CFR.
Zuari has bought a second cargo of 30-35,000 mt from Sabic (under an MoU) at about $485-486/mt CFR with delivery expected by April 20. The first cargo of 30-35,000 mt was also priced at $485-486/mt CFR Mundra, according to sources, and arrived in the last week of March.
Ma'aden has now agreed MoUs with three Indian buyers for 700,000 mt to be delivered
between April this year and March 2016. The price will be negotiated before each shipment. The exact division is unclear though Kribcho has agreed to take about 250,000 mt, Zuari will take 100,000 mt leaving a third buyer, thought to be IPL, with about 350,000 mt.
PhosAgro is visiting several buyers including IPL/IFFCO and the two companies are considering the purchase of two to three DAP cargoes once clarity emerges over the NBS.
Price ideas for Chinese DAP are around $480 CFR with Saudi product in the mid-to-high $480s/mt CFR.
RCF is expected to take another one or two days to finalise its DAP tender.
With regard to the MRP, the current range for most producers is between INR 23,300-23,800/mt. IFFCO has maintained a lower MRP through Q1 at INR 23,200 but is planning to increase this by INR 500/mt to INR 23,700/mt. TCL, one of OCP's JV partners, is heard to have raised its MRP already to INR 24,260/mt.
India: January DAP imports up nearly 40%
India imported 116,781 mt of DAP in January, a 39% increase on January 2013, according to GTIS data.
In January, Saudi Arabia supplied 65,810 mt or 56% of the total import volume, while the US supplied 50,970 mt or 44% of the total import volume.
GTIS data for the full calendar year 2014 showed Indian DAP imports at 3.8 million mt, higher than 2013 when just 3.6 million mt were imported. Imports over the previous four calendar years had averaged 5.5 million mt DAP.
India imported 199,788 mt of phosacid in January, an 83% increase on its January 2014 imports, according to GTIS data. Almost 80% of the imports came from OCP which limited its export shipments to only its joint venture partners during Q1. For Q2 it is expecting to increase volumes to a level similar to Q4 2014 when around 100-120,000 mt P2O5 per month was supplied from Morocco.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Phosphate prices showing signs of further weakness
Chinese phosphate prices are showing further signs of weakness as major MAP demand in Brazil is yet to emerge and domestic DAP consumption is currently limited. Exports are expected to be high through April.
Phosphate and NPK producers in China can comfortably afford the current sulphur price, but are holding off as they anticipate sulphur will decline further in the weeks ahead.
Concern among sulphur suppliers at the lack of Chinese demand is causing producers to drop prices, but this is yet to stimulate a buy-side reaction. Chinese delivered sulphur is currently assessed at $150-160/mt CFR.
Some Chinese phosphate producers have planned maintenance in April and May, so operating rates are expected to decline in May, with normal production expected to resume from late June.
Distributors and traders say small and mid-tier phosphate companies may delay maintenance as they seek to supply the export market from April, rather than from late May/June. These smaller producers are likely to produce at rates of around 80% to maximise exports.
For the largest producers (such as YTH and Wengfu), for whom maintenance was scheduled in May, plants are not expected take complete shutdowns. Operating rates are instead likely to drop to 60-70% from 80% for three or four weeks, before normal production is resumed.
Exports to India between February and April will have been comparatively high due to a need by Indian importers to replenish stocks ahead of the next season and on the Chinese side, facilitated by the removal of seasonal export restrictions from the beginning of 2015. The weaker RMB has also encouraged Chinese suppliers to take advantage of additional export opportunities.
The lower end of DAP Bulk FOB China Spot is assessed by Fertilizer Week as slightly lower on last week at $460-470/mt FOB. Most large producers have booked their production through April and don't have product available for prompt sale. However, domestic DAP sales are said to be very slow, not just for seasonal reasons but also due to the price advantage MAP and NPKs currently hold over DAP.
Some regional markets such as Northwest China, demand has been postponed due to extreme weather conditions. Ploughing time has been pushed back by at least one or two weeks. Demand in Northern and Northeast China is also limited.
Producers will not currently move much volume to ports as they do not expect to see a sharp increase in monthly shipments in April or May, hence there has been no obvious growth of port inventory.
As seen last week, MAP remains under pressure. Chinese granular 11-44-0 can sell at $350-360/mt FOB, according to sources in China, with granular MAP 10-50-0 at around $405/mt FOB. MAP Bagged EXW 11- 44-0 is assessed at RMB 1,900-2,000/mt, a decline of about RMB 125/mt week on week, with 10-50-0 at RMB 2,100-2,200/mt, down RMB 75/mt on last week.
Major buyers are still said to be traders rather than end users with demand and supply roughly balanced. No negotiations are not yet under way for deliveries after mid May.
Some traders are reportedly eyeing exports to the US of granular 10-50-0 or 11-52-0 for June onwards, but no business was heard to have been concluded at the time of writing.
Vietnam: Australian DAP bought at $500 CFR
Incitec Pivot is reported to have sold a cargo of around 20,000 mt Australian DAP into Vietnam at $500/mt CFR for end April loading. The producer was not immediately available to confirm the trade.
Elsewhere in Vietnam, cargoes of bagged DAP were traded at $490/mt CFR Ho Chi Minh and cross-border trade with China was reported at $475-480/mt CFR.

Europe: Phosacid negotiations expected
The market still awaits news of Q2 phosphoric acid contract negotiations for Europe. The main players were unavailable for comment this week, indicating talks may be underway.

India: MFL receives two offers in phosacid tender
MFL received two offers in its 10,000 mt phosphoric acid tender from Sterlite and Aries. The offers are likely to open in the next one or two days. The tender was due to close on April 6.
The latest phosacid arrivals in India are as follows:

Egypt: 40,000 mt rock cargo will be country's first higher-grade export
Egypt is nearing its first ever export sale of higher grade phosphate rock with a 40,000 mt cargo expected to load within days.
A vessel is understood to be on its way to Safaga on the Red Sea coast.
The shipment, negotiated through a trader at an undisclosed price, will be delivered to India. The buyer has not been named.
Misr Phosphate was awarded a licence last year by the Egyptian government to operate the Red Sea Mine, previously held by Red Sea Mining Corp.
Misr began management of the site in September 2014 and plans to increase production to as much as 100,000 mt/month phosphate rock (30-32% P2O5 or 66-70% BPL). There are currently stocks at the mine of about 250,000 mt.
Egypt has taken steps to become more competitive in the global phosphate rock market by redistributing some mining licences. The country has only ever exported lower-grade rock, with a maximum P2O5 content of 30%.
One Egyptian trader said last month that negotiations to supply India with rock from the Red Sea Mine and a price of $93 FOB Egypt had been floated.

NP/NPKS
EUROPE
Europe: Weak levels of NPK activity
NPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months, with only small deals being made despite being deep into normal spring buying season.
Weak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks and apprehension on the farmers' buying side have all impacted NPK demand and even the reduced prices are failing to attract buyers.
Indications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively. Triple 15 offers are being made as low as $325/mt FOB, according to sources, but buyers are either disinterested or are bidding significantly lower.
With OCP bringing on its new 1 million mt integrated granulation plant this month, Russian NP/NPK business will become ever more vulnerable to competition from Morocco, particularly in Africa.
We have already begun to see increased Russian (PhosAgro and Acron) activity in the Indian market, a market that Russian producers have foregone in the last two years.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Kenya: KTDA awards 70,000 mt NPK tender
The Kenya Tea Development Agency awarded its annual tender for about 70,000 mt NPK 26-5-5 to Mekatrade after receiving four offers.
Singapore-based Mekatrade will deliver product from Uralchem at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.
Yara submitted the highest offer at $375/mt CFR. Ameropa came in at $367 CFR and a third trader offered at $368/mt CFR.
The volumes will be delivered in two shipments, with the first in July and the second a month later, an official at KTDA told Fertilizer Week. A production period of 28 days is required once the letter of credit has been issued.
The original tender was for 69,000 mt.

India: January NPK imports at 2-year high
India imported 39,525 mt of NPKs in January, its largest January figures since 2012 and more than half of its full-year 2014 NPK imports, according to GTIS data.
In January, Russia supplied 38,455 mt, or 97% of the total import volume, a figure which is more than Russia provided in the whole of 2014.
In the full year 2014, India only imported 65,286 mt of NPKs, with more than half coming from Russia. The high January imports may be a sign that India could signal a return to the levels of yearly NPK imports seen between 2010 and 2012.
NPK production in India between April 2014 and February is up by 13% at 7.3 million mt as DAP producers switched to NPKs in the face of higher phosphoric acid prices.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Indonesia: NPK imports double in 2014
Indonesia imported 423,187 mt of NPKs in 2014, almost doubling its full-year figures from 2013 and the country's highest yearly imports since 2008, according to GTIS.
NPK demand in Indonesia is steadily growing, partly to feed rising palm oil production.
The country imported more than 50% of the NPK volumes from Malaysia, while 35%came from Norway.
