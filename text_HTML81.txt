ANALYSIS
ICL strike ends, US prices continue to slip
The potash market is largely unchanged this week as suppliers attempt to push up prices in Brazil, despite increased supply following resolution to the strike at ICL's Dead Sea Works and continuing weakness in the US spot markets.
ICL agreed a deal with striking workers late on May 28 after three months of strikes which could have cost the company as much as 1 million mt in possible production. The new deal reduces staff at its Dead Sea Works and Bromine operations as part of the company's on-going efficiency plan. Workers have already returned to operations at DSW.
Indian buyers are said to be agreeing quantities for the current fertilizer year with ICL now that the strike is over and a volume announcement is expected within the next two weeks from the Israeli producer. Potash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.
The US spot market has further weakened this week with Agrium believed to be offering June-September availability to Midwest buyers at around $370/st FOB. Overall prices are believed to have fallen to as low as $365/st FOB in the Midwest and offers in the next few months are said to include price protection, indicating that further price falls could be imminent.
The US imported 4.3 million mt of potash between January and April, 24% higher than the same point last year. With Canpotex reducing re-exports through Portland along with higher imports from Uralkali and new material from BPC so far in 2015, the US is proving to be an increasingly competitive market.
The Chinese domestic market is out of season and purchasing activity is slow. The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($323-332)/mt FCA but the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, has fallen to RMB 2,100 ($339)/mt FCA from RMB 2,130/mt FCA.
Europe is also out of season and prices are quoted at €300-310/mt CIF while Southeast Asian potash prices are flat at $310-350/mt CFR, but more Malaysian tenders have been awarded at $310-312/mt CFR levels.
BPC continued a strong month for deals after announcing that it has been awarded 80% of the volumes (192,000 mt) in a Bangladeshi tender this week. The company agreed an increase in volumes to India during IFA Istanbul and was recently awarded RCF's tender for as much as 265,000 mt, with firm deliveries to be made this month.
Suppliers are pinning their hopes on Brazil for the coming months if they want to reverse the weak price levels seen so far in 2015 across most markets. Prices currently remain at $330-340/mt CFR for Brazilian potash with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. In coming weeks major suppliers plan to push for increases to as high as $345-350/mt CFR for June/July deliveries, before again increasing prices for August/September delivery if possible.
Achieving their targets in Brazil should help suppliers recover losses in other key potash markets later in 2015. However, with Brazilian and US spot potash prices currently $40-50/mt lower than those at the end of 2014, the question is whether price discipline amongst suppliers remains strong enough.

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.

NORTH AMERICA
Canada: Potash exports up by 1 million mt
Canada exported 1.7 million mt potash in April, a 3.5% increase year on year, according to GTIS data.
As a result, Canada has exported 6.5 million of potash in the year to date, 17% or 1 million mt more than the same period in 2014. Between January and April, 3.5 million mt was sent to the US and 903,000 mt was re- exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.
The country exported 922,000 mt to the US in April, with 237,000 mt re-exported through Portland.
Including the exports from Portland, in April Canpotex exported 404,000 mt to Brazil, 222,000 mt to China, 152,000 mt to Indonesia and 67,000 mt to India.
Between January and April, including the exports from Portland, Canpotex exported 856,000 mt to Brazil, 664,000 mt to Indonesia, 575,000 mt to China, 358,000 mt to India and 468,000 mt to Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand combined.
US: April potash imports flat but re-exports down
The US imported 1.0 million mt of potash in April, largely flat year on year, bringing its year-to-date imports to 4.3 million mt, 24% higher than the same point in 2014, according to GTIS data.
Canadian producers sent 922,000 mt to the US in April, with 237,000 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic. Despite imports being flat in April, re-exports fell 10% adding high competition and excess supply to the US market.
The US also imported 92,772 mt from Uralkali during April, a 44% increase from the Russian producer year-on-year.
In the year-to-date, the US imported 4.3 million mt of potash with 903,000 mt re-exported as part of the Canpotex agreement. 3.5 million mt came from Canada, 378,000 mt from Uralkali, 140,000 mt from BPC and 133,000 mt from ICL.
US NOLA: Barge market anticipated fill market
Granular potash barge values fell in prior weeks, effectively anticipating aggressive fill marketing from Canadian and offshore potash suppliers in the US.
The $325/st FOB New Orleans business completed in prior weeks thanks to excessive barge supplies in the Gulf likely figured into suppliers deciding on summer fill values.
Canada: Returns to Saskatchewan sellers lower from
US
Returns to Saskatchewan potash producers are down substantially since the start of the spring, thanks to recent offers from some producers into the US for fill programs that began this month.
At press time indications for Canadian granular potash were as low as $370/st FOB in the US Midwest, suggesting a return no better than $340/st FOB mine in Saskatchewan. Even these returns may come under pressure if cheaper offers of overseas material already in play force Canadian producers to match up.
US Midwest: Potash fill offers include price protection
Offers for granular potash available to Midwest retailers during June-September include price protection, an assurance typically only employed by suppliers when they find their customer base is certain there will be cheaper values in coming months.
Agrium is named by market sources as offering June-September availability to Midwest buyers at around $370/st FOB, with price protection through October. Subsequently, a trader offered potash from overseas for June pickup from terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $365/st FOB. Price protection for this offer runs through September.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Potash prices stable ahead of suppliers push
Brazilian potash activity is expected to be quite strong through June and July but there have been limited deals this week as buyers return to Brazil from IFA Istanbul last week.
Suppliers are confident that with high demand in the coming weeks and price discipline, prices can be pushed up from the weak levels seen so far in 2015 and are banking on Brazilian increases to help push up other spot markets later in the year.
Prices currently remain at $330-340/mt CFR for Brazilian potash with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. In coming weeks major suppliers plan to push for increases towards as high as $345- 350/mt CFR for June/July deliveries before again increasing prices for August/September delivery if possible.
In some good news the Brazilian government has announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the harvest support programme. Brazilian delegates at IFA voiced concerns over the availability of credit so the announcement may help ease those worries but depressed demand is likely to remain in Brazil, considering higher interest rates, inflation and low corn prices.
Colombia: Potash imports at 100,000 mt in Q1
Colombia imported 100,000 mt of potash in Q1, an 8% increase year on year and the highest Q1 imports since 2011, according to GTIS.
During the quarter, Colombia imported 55,000 mt from Canpotex, 25,000 mt from Uralkali and 13,000 mt from K+S.
Recent deals from BPC and Uralkali to Colombia are believed to have been made in the mid $340s/mt CFR.
Colombia imported 486,595 mt of potash in 2014, a 30% increase year on year with Canpotex and Uralkali providing almost 80% of the imports.
EUROPE
Europe: Market out of season, prices largely stable
The European market is largely stable this week and out of season. Prices are quoted €300-310/mt CIF to Northwest Europe for granular deals.
Some sources continue to highlight tight supply, particularly for standard potash, with most suppliers sending large volumes to China and India under the new contracts.
European prices are unlikely to see major changes until the market begins to build again in July.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: Potash imports rise as OCP ups NPK production
Morocco imported 57,000 mt of potash in Q1 2015, an increase from just 8,000 mt in Q1 2014 as OCP builds up its NPK production, according to GTIS data.
The imports are more than OCP's entire MOP imports in 2013 and already over half of the 109,035 mt of MOP imports in 2014. During the quarter, Morocco imported 26,000 mt from ICL's Spanish operations, 15,000 mt from Uralkali and 14,000 mt from APC.
Concurrently, Q1 NPK exports from Morocco jumped to 88,000 mt from just 6,000 mt in Q1 2014 with large volumes delivered to Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Benin. In 2014, OCP exported 313,000 mt NPKs, with more than 75% going to the African markets.
The Moroccan giant recently embarked on a major expansion with hopes of tripling its fertilizer output in 10 years. OCP also plans to increase its overall capacity of NPKs with the first of its new DAP/MAP/NPK plants expected to start commercial production in late June/early July at Jorf Lasfar. The fully integrated plant will have a capacity for 1 million mt DAP/MAP/NPKs.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: ICL soon to announce Indian agreements
Buyers in India have been in talks with ICL this week following news that the strike at its Dead Sea Works operations has come to an end.
Zuari has confirmed that it has already agreed volumes with ICL, along with APC, BPC, Canpotex and Uralkali totalling 700,000 mt. ICL's total list of quantity agreements should be announced in the next week or two and will likely be similar to the 700,000 mt it sent in the last fertilizer year.
Deepak Fertilisers has confirmed that it agreed to buy 60,000 mt from Uralkali while Chambal bought 100,000 mt from BPC and is currently in the process of buying another 100-120,000 mt, most likely from Uralkali.
Potash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.
Around 50,000 mt of potash is scheduled for arrival in the next week to India, inlcuding a 33,000 mt shipment from APC to IPL and an 18,000 mt shipment from Canpotex to TCL.
Bangladesh: BPC awarded 80% of private tender
BPC will deliver 192,000 mt of potash to multiple importers as part of the Bangladesh Ministry of Agriculture private tender that closed on May 31.
BPC won the volumes at an average price of $344/mt with 180 days credit, excluding the price of bags, a spokeswoman for the company told Fertilizer Week.
The MoA received offers from 21 importers representing different international suppliers.
The potash part of the tender is for as much as 240,000 mt and shipment in September, with individual importers able to submit offers for a maximum of 24,000 mt MOP but suppliers not limited in the number of agents they may use.
The 21 importers offered quantities between 10,000 and 24,000 mt and prices between $327.50/mt and $348.50/mt. These prices are quoted on a CFR basis including another $10/mt for bagging and other charges.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: More tenders awarded at lower prices in Malaysia
Further tender awards have been announced in the $310-312/mt CFR level for Malaysia with prices unlikely to see any increases until the market builds back up in August/September.
Most of the larger tender awards were made during last week's IFA Istanbul conference and action should be quite slow in the near term in Malaysia.
Indonesian potash is believed to be priced below the $325/mt CFR level with some sources quoting deals as low as $315/mt CFR. Quotes from the smaller markets such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand are made at $330-350/mt CFR.
As a result, potash prices are currently seen at $310-350/mt CFR across Southeast Asia.
China: QSL on track for 5 million mt production
QSL Potash, created by the merger of the two largest subsidiaries of QSL in March, is believed to have produced more than 1.4 million mt of potash between January and the end of April.
The level puts QSL Potash on track to produce 4.5 million mt potash in 2015, allowing the whole group to reach its planned production of 5 million mt this year.
The merged entity was created to improve management, efficiency and help increase production. Together their production levels represented roughly 86% of the 4.3 million mt produced by QSL in 2014.
China: Domestic prices dip further during off-season
The Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow. Port wholesale prices are largely stable with some slight falls at the top end of prices.
The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($323-332)/mt FCA but the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, has fallen to RMB 2,100 ($339)/mt FCA from RMB 2,130/mt FCA.
Arrivals of seaborne volumes remain at a stable high following recent contract agreements but some sources have suggested that border rail deliveries may be cut back in the coming months.
In Q1, average potash rail deliveries from Russia are believed to have been around 175,000 mt but this rate is said to have fallen to 136,000 mt in April, with the new level expected to remain for May and June.
Rail side spot prices into northern China are quoted as unchanged despite the recent $10/mt seaborne contract price increase, they remain at $300-305/mt CPT, but Uralkali has been boosted in the last six months by significant falls in the rail tariff to China after a switch to a less-costly route to Zabaikalsk on the border and the weak ruble.
Japan: Potash imports at five-year high
Japan imported 180,946 mt of potash between January and April, a 7% increase on the same period in 2014 and the highest January-April imports since 2010, according to GTIS.
Japan imported 138,000 mt from Canpotex, or 77% of its entire imports, while 20,000 mt was imported from Uralkali. Canpotex concluded its H1 potash contracts for Japan in December 2014 at an average price of over $410/mt CFR depending on grade, an agreement for the second half is likely to be made shortly.
While Q1 imports were down on 2014, in April Japan imported 68,000 mt or five-times the imports in April 2014.
Japan's full-year 2014 imports were 534,365 mt, a 12% year-on-year increase, with 73% of the imports coming from Canpotex.
Malaysia: Early 2015 potash imports up 50%
Malaysia imported 273,606 mt of potash in January and February, a 50% increase year on year and the highest January-February imports since 2003, according to GTIS.
During the period both Canpotex and Uralkali increased volumes by 8% and 10% respectively but BPC saw the largest increase, sending more than 60,000 mt compared with just 7,000 mt in the same period during 2014. ICL's Spanish operations sent 27,400 mt and APC sent more than 25,000 mt.
The figures confirm high levels of competition in Malaysia, which coupled with strong inventory levels and currency depreciation, has held down prices in the key Southeast Asian country.
Malaysia imported 1.6 million mt potash in the full year 2014, a 29% increase on its 2013 imports and
its largest on record. The increase is largely due to higher palm oil output in 2014, which rose 2.1% during the year to 20.09 million mt, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. In 2015, palm oil output is expected to continue its increase but at a much slower rate due to recent flooding and weaker commodity prices.
SOP
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Archean plans to start SOP exports this month
Archean Group's Rann of Kutch Gujarat project began production of SOP in April after a lengthy overrun, the company told Fertilizer Week.
The project, which is set to produce 100,000 mt/year of SOP before ramping up towards as much as 400,000 mt/year, was planned for operation in the second half of 2011.
However, development of the project has been slow and key environmental approvals were not awarded until earlier this year.
Archean plans to sell material to export markets from June onwards and it is targeting sales for Europe and Asia but it is yet to sign any firm agreements over exports.
NPKS
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Ukraine: NPK imports at five-year low
Ukraine's Q1 NPK imports were 195,000 mt, a 21% fall year on year and the lowest Q1 imports since 2010 as conflict continues with separatist rebels in the east of the country.
Imports from Russia saw the biggest drop, 24%, with Russian producers sending 165,000 mt, around 50,000 mt less than the same period in 2014. Belarusian producers sent 21,000 mt, 18% less than last year.
The figures come as an International Monetary Fund mission to the country announced that the Ukrainian economy is likely to have shrank by a worse-than-expected 9% in Q1 2015.
In the full year 2014, Ukraine imported 791,642 mt of NPKs according to GTIS, down by 9% on 2013. Russian NPKs accounted for 85% of the import market last year with 13% of all imports supplied from Belarus.
EUROPE
Europe: NPK prices quoted lower this week with limited activity
Activity remains slow in the European NPK market, but with suppliers largely sold out through June after selling product to other markets, sources are confident that higher prices can soon be achieved for the multi- component fertilizer in Europe.
Indications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 have fallen slightly to $320-335/mt FOB while 16-16-16 prices are down by $5/mt to $335-345/mt FOB. OCP quote European prices for 15-15-15 at $350/mt FOB but deals at this level are unconfirmed at this point.
With high levels of NPK activity in Southeast Asia, India, China and Africa so far in 2015, most suppliers say their order books are largely full through June and the prices quoted are for deals from July.
India's IPL is now increasing NPK imports after signing a three-year deal to buy 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs and DAP during the IFA conference last week. The deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26.
It is unclear whether PhosAgro plans to reduce some NPK sales into Europe in the coming few years in the wake of the new deal in India but in November 2014 the company said it plans to more than double NP/NPK/NPS sales to Europe by 2020.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: Thailand's NPK imports drop 23%
Thailand imported 306,000 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 23% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS.
During the period, Thailand imported the same volumes of NPKs from Russian producers as in 2014 (224,000 mt) but it saw a 64% reduction in Yara imports.
Malaysia imported 58,000 mt of NPKs in January and February, doubling its imports for the same period in 2014. Russian producers sent 22,000 mt and Indonesia sent 13,000 mt.
Malaysia exported the same volumes (58,000 mt) NPKs with 92% going to Indonesia.
Palm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and may have an impact on overall NPK imports across the region.

FINANCIALS
Uralkali extends pre-export facility by $100 million
Russian potash producer Uralkali has signed a $100 million increase on its $530 million pre-export finance facility with the Bank of China.
The facility has now increased to $630 million and there is an option to increase the loan amount by another $170 million to a total of $800 million.
The loan agreement, which was agreed in April, is with eight international banks, including Societe Generale, Commerzbank, Industrial Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank.
The interest rate on the deal is LIBOR plus 330 bps margin with a loan maturity of four years. Uralkali plans to use the loan for general corporate purposes, including helping fund its ambitious $4.5 billion expansion plans to raise capacity by 30% over the next five years.
The news comes a week after Uralkali investors tendered for 11.89% of shares in its recently-announced share buyback. The deal sees Uralkali buy $1.12 billion in stock rather than the $1.5 billion it had planned.
Uralkali may now have enough offers to buy shares in order to delist from the London Stock Exchange. With some shareholders believed to see the company as undervalued, Uralkali may now look to take the company private.
Acron Q1 net income up on weak ruble, efficiency measures
Russian fertilizer producer Acron's revenues and net profit increased in the first quarter due to efficiency measures and the weak rouble despite a decrease in sales volumes in its key products.
Acron posted a 59% increase in revenues to RUB 27.7 billion ($445 million), due mainly to a collapse in ruble exchange rates at the end of 2014, as well higher year-on-year dollar-denominated prices for complex fertilizers.
The company's net profit increased to RUB 7.1 billion from RUB 1.4 billion in Q1 2014 with Acron saying that its Oleniy Ruchey mine achieved record operating results of 100,000 mt of apatite concentrate during March.
On a dollar basis using Acron's average exchange rate across Q1 2015 and Q1 2014, revenues fell to $444.7 million against $496.3 million, but net profit increased to $113.6 million from $41.1 million.
The company said the output of its key products was 1.6 million mt, down 2% year on year, and its sales of key products fell 4% to 1.5 million mt due to maintenance at its Novgorod-based facility.
Acron noted that costs of goods sold increased, mainly due to higher comparative potash prices, which are pegged to the dollar exchange rate. The company also posted an exchange loss of RUB 1.4 billion from the revaluation of its assets, loans and liabilities.
PhosAgro boosts Q1 net profits on higher production
Russian fertilizer producer PhosAgro increased net profits in its first quarter on a dollar basis to $228 million from $55 million the previous year as production, sales volumes and most prices increased.
The company said total fertilizer production increased 8% year-on-year due to efficiency measures, with its phosphates operations recording a 4% increase in sales volumes to 1.3 million mt. Its nitrates division saw a 3% fall in sales volumes to 412,500 mt.
First quarter revenues were up 71% on a rouble basis but due to the massive depreciation of the currency against the dollar at the end of 2014, revenues are down on a dollar basis to $808 million from $841 million.
The company said it received higher realised prices on a rouble basis for DAP/MAP and NPK exports during Q1. Average DAP prices in Q1 were $483/mt FOB Tampa, up 2% year on year.
On a rouble basis, revenue from DAP/MAP sales more than doubled and revenue from phosphate rock sales increased 22%, but sales volumes decreased 27% due to higher internal consumption. NPK export sales more than doubled.
PhosAgro saw a net loss in Q4 from revaluation of USD and EUR denominated loans but a clean slate in 2015 coupled with higher production has given the company a good start to the year.
In February, PhosAgro commissioned a new phosphate-potash-sulphur fertilizer production line with capacity of 100,000mt/year and the company said it now intends to invest further in expansion of the number of NPK and other fertilizer grades it produces.
In the upcoming summer season PhosAgro expects significant buying activity from India and Brazil and it noted that it now expects India's 2015 DAP imports to reach 5.5-6 million mt in 2015, at least a 2 million mt increase on last year.
During the IFA conference this week, PhosAgro agreed a three-year deal to sell 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs to India.
The deal between PhosAgro and IPL is over a three year period suggesting around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26 but also including DAP and NPS.
PhosAgro has not shipped any NPKs to India in such sizeable volumes since 2012 when it exported an estimated 250,000 mt through Ameropa against its contract with IFFCO.
The company said in a conference call May 29 that individual sales as part of the contract would be made on a spot basis. At today's prices and freights, Indian netbacks on Russian DAP are in the low/mid $450s/mt FOB Baltic, significantly lower than potential netbacks from Brazil at current price levels of $500/mt CFR.
Despite the current weak rupee, PhosAgro forecasts significantly higher NPK demand outweighing domestic output in the coming years due to high internal production costs. During 2014, domestic NPK production rose by 13% to 7.8 million mt and so far in 2015, domestic production has risen further.
The new PhosAgro deal could also have an effect on potash demand in India. If domestic NPK production slows due to the imported NPKs then the recent trend of higher potash buying could slow.
FREIGHT/SHIPPING
K+S begins modifications at Port Moody
German potash producer K+S and Pacific Coast Terminals Co. have begun modifications to the existing bulk handling facility in Port Moody, Canada, in order for the site to take potash from the Legacy project.
K+S Potash Canada is currently on track and on budget to start potash production in late 2016 at the CAD
4.1billion Legacy solution mine in Saskatchewan. The company plans to ramp up production to two million mt/year by 2017 before a gradual extension of the annual capacity to 2.86 million mt of potash products.
The handling facility stores and transports potash products arriving by rail and will allow K+S access to its international clients from the Legacy site. Completion of the modifications is planned for late 2016.

ICL comes to agreement with striking workers
After three months of strikes at Israeli fertilizer producer ICL's Dead Sea Potash Works and Neot Hovav Bromine operations in Israel, an agreement has been reached and employees will return to work immediately, ICL said in a press release May 29.
Management at ICL have now signed an agreement with Israel's General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) and unions representing ICL Israel employees. The deal provides a new framework for ICL's restructuring plan and allows for a reduction in the workforce at both production facilities.
According to the final terms, the labour reduction at ICL Dead Sea Works and ICL Neot Hovav will total 248 employees, 210 of which will be through an early retirement plan.
The strike, which began in mid-February, cost ICL $164 million in lost revenues in Q1 and net income was hit by $76 million. The company said the impact of the strike will be higher in Q2 due to depleted inventories of bromine during the quarter.
ICL said that while the strike was costly it considers it to have been 'a worthwhile investment in the future of its plants in Israel' and the economic benefits of the strike will 'significantly exceed its costs'.
The company said that DSW facilities have been less competitive in the past few years due to lower potash prices and high labour costs in Israel, while an 'unfriendly business environment… by the previous Israeli government' led to higher taxes and royalties.
The strikes are likely to have cost ICL as much as 1 million mt in production from the Dead Sea Works so far in 2015. The company has managed to make divestments to boost its net income in Q1 and covered some of its lost sales volumes by increasing production at its Spanish and UK operations.
The company also still managed to agree its major Chinese potash contracts for 2015, with buyers agreeing that volumes which ICL fails to provide in the first half of the year due to the strikes can be replaced by extra volumes in the second half of the year.
Ending the strike comes just in time for ICL to agree a new contract with its Indian buyers, after Belarusian potash producer BPC agreed its volumes during the IFA Conference this week. Last year ICL agreed roughly
700,000 mt in quantities to its Indian customers and the company is likely to have already conducted discussions over new contracts during the conference in anticipation of the end to strikes.
Despite it already being nearly two months into the new fertilizer year in India, potash demand is expected to increase in the country and ICL should be able to agree similar quantities to its Indian buyers.

ICL may owe Haifa over potash pricing
Israeli fertilizer producer ICL may have to make a provision in its Q2 financial statements to pay as much as $70 million to Haifa over potash pricing in 2012-13, Israeli publication The Marker reported on May 2.
The most recent ruling in on-going arbitration proceedings regarding potash pricing from ICL to Haifa for its NOP requirements has found that settlement over payments between the two parties needs to be made for between 2011 and 2013.
An examiner for the court ruled that a refund should be paid by Haifa to ICL's Dead Sea Works operations for 2011 but that for both 2012 and 2013, Haifa can request returns from ICL to meet a court formula agreement over pricing.
In early 2014, an Israeli court ruled that quarterly sales prices for potash to Haifa would be based on a formula rather than a set price by ICL.
ICL may now be liable to pay $60-70 million to Haifa, according to The Marker.
In ICL's 2014 financial report it said that the company was unlikely to have to pay significant amounts in respect to 2009-2013 and no provisions were included in the 2014 figures.
ICL says it is reviewing the court ruling and intends to petition the court against it over the 2012-13 decision. The company also noted that it was is reviewing any provision that may need to be made in its Q2 financial statements.
