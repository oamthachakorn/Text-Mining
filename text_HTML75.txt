ANALYSIS
Crop prices yet again take their toll on fertilizer demand with the US market the latest to be affected
US domestic demand appears set to take a substantial hit this spring, as market sources throughout the supply chain report farmers will cut application rates in the key growing areas by around 20% per acre due to low crop values versus fertilizer input costs.
Until recently suppliers had hoped that contract requirements to maintain specified levels of fertility on rented ground would help support demand, but reports to Fertilizer Week are that renters and landowners have agreed that sticking to normal application rates will simply produce losses for renters. The bad news for suppliers comes even as seasonal demand emerges in the US Midwest and Southern Plains. While this has been supportive of current pricing, the supply chain is well stocked according to distributors. Expectations are that cheaper input costs next year will allow US farmers to return to historical application rates. However, there are no confirmed reports of fill pricing from Mosaic for the summer.
Elsewhere the market has been seasonally quiet with many of the major players in China this week. Indian importers are taking a breather having lined up sufficient tonnes to cover immediate requirements and build up a buffer stock ahead of the season. They are also awaiting final confirmation of the NBS rates, which although are expected to remain largely unchanged, will need to be confirmed to give real clarity on pricing.
Chinese producers meanwhile are relaxed with a solid quantity of export business on the books for the major producers in India and some curtailments as a result of planned maintenance. As such they are holding firm on price in the range of $460-470/mt FOB with many still citing numbers at the mid-upper end of this range. Buyers are quoting lower numbers and rumours have been circulating that sales in the mid $470s/mt CFR India have been concluded however there is no firm evidence as yet to back up these
reports. Nevetheless buyers are putting pressure on Chinese suppliers to reduce prices below $480/mt CFR for the next round of import purchasing. If values for non-Chinese product hold in the mid $480s/mt CFR for India, then US exports also will be competitive in that market.
In Brazil the import campaign is yet to start. However the freefall in price indications seen in recent weeks appears to have been halted with Russian producers said to be offering at higher levels for May. Mosaic meanwhile has dropped its export price down to $460-463/mt FOB which although moving in the right direction is still equating to a CFR level well above current indications from Brazilian buyers. Current in Brazil prices remain unsupported by any real volumes but perhaps a floor, albeit temporary, has been found.
Highlights of the Week
∙Mosaic drops its price to $460-463/mt FOB Tampa
∙Rollover in NW European phosphoric acid contracts for Q2
∙Rumours of lower prices in India but no firm confirmation
∙NBS rates yet to be announced
∙Chinese prices remain in range of $460-470/mt FOB
∙Bangladesh to issue tender for private sector import of DAP and TSP
Short Term Outlook
The market is likely to remain quiet through to May and even mid-May by which time most producers will have completed their respective turnarounds. Although the market will remain weak until then, it will stabilise as the key importers return to the marketplace such as India, Pakistan, Brazil, Bangladesh and Turkey. The import prospects for India and Pakistan are looking positive, given a normal monsoon, while the longer the Brazilians delay, the shorter the import window and the more condensed it will become. As such the market could get quite interesting by June particularlry as two major Chinese producers are foregoing MAP production and concentrating their efforts on DAP only. The potential downside risk could come from increased production in Morocco as OCP ramps up JPH-1, but OCP has proved that it will curtail production if demand warrants such a move.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Export benchmark moves down
The Tampa benchmark fell by as much as $10/mt this week with a sale by Mosaic of 15,000 mt of DAP sold to Latin America at $460-463/mt FOB for May shipment. In the meantime, rumors of possible sales of DAP cargos to India continued. The decline in US Gulf Q2 liquid sulphur costs likely making that market more attractive over the summer. It also reduces the likelihood of market related curtailments. However, some traders believe Mosaic may consider such a move depending on upcoming MAP pricing for Brazil and elsewhere.
US Midwest: DAP moving, but demand expectations lower
Expectations about spring demand for DAP and MAP have been replaced by reports of deliveries of previously ordered material and new spot sales.
While phosphates are moving, distributors say it has become apparent that farmers are cutting phosphate application rates, even on rented ground. Landowners understand that renters will lose money if fertility requirements in contracts are enforced to the letter this year, given current input costs, land rents and new crop pricing. Anecdotal reports expect demand in the Midwest region to be off by around 20% compared to the prior year, although much of that decline will be due to fewer corn acres in the region compared to last year. Prices for truck loads remain around $460/st FOB.
US New Orleans: Barge values flat with steady demand
Most DAP trades in the US barge market were cited around $410/st FOB this week for barges in the Gulf or prompt load dates.
Barges up the river traded at higher values, with Cairo Illinois and St. Louis Missouri business still cited around, $415-$420/st FOB, in line with last week. Reports of trades, bids and offers for MAP barges are across a range either with no premium to DAP to up to $5/st more expensive.
Buyers’ timidity in prior weeks and even in the current market is helping to support New Orleans prices in the near term, with endusers exhausting alternatives before committing to further barges. This has left sellers in a position of strength. However, inland buyers are buying only with this season in mind.
US: Export rate continued to gain through March
US DAP and MAP export volumes in March of this year were 169,111 st (153,416 mt) P2O5, up from 142,873 st (129,613 mt) P2O5, according to the latest producer data from The Fertilizer Institute.
This trend continued for much of the current fertilizer year that has seen US exports stay moderately ahead of July-March shipments in the previous year , at 1.59 million st (1.44 million mt) P2O5 this year versus 1.36 million st (1.24 million mt) P2O5 for 2013/14.
A comparison of export destinations between March of this year and March 2014 does not show a significant difference in destinations. Primary destinations for US DAP/MAP during March of this year included Brazil at 47,788 st P2O5, Mexico at 20,941 st P2O5 and Australia at 18,346 st P2O5.
For the first nine months of the current fertilizer year through March, US DAP/MAP exports were dominated by its historically key customers of Brazil at 340,551 st P2O5, India at 258,629 st P2O5 and Canada at 258,375 st P2O5.
Mexico: Fertinal committed through May
Fertinal is committed through May with shipments to South America and the domestic market.
With the Australian shipping programme now over, Fertinal has shifted its attention to markets closer to home until the Australian season resumes later in the year. As such it has just finished loading 33,000 mt DAP/MAP on the Orient Tide for Ameropa/Argentina and Uruguay, as reported previously. The tonnes were priced on a formula basis.
This will be followed by a 35-40,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP cargo for Chile loading late April and a second Latin American cargo is believed to be loading in May. In addition, Fertinal will be supplying the domestic market and on the basis of all these shipments, will therefore be fully committed through to June. Price levels remain unchanged in the $460s/470/mt FOB range. It is now discussing H1 June business.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Little change as buyers continue to take as needed
The market remains unchanged in terms of demand but prices have continued to weaken over the past couple of weeks.
Brazilian buyers are yet to really show their hand and return to the market in earnest for the main import season. There appears to be no rush and at least two major suppliers are prepared for further delays to the start of the import campaign. Price indications for MAP remain weak although there are signs that maybe a floor has, at least temporarily, been reached.
Following reports last week of Russian offers as low as $460/mt CFR, it would appear that these have now moved up with talk of $470/mt CFR being indicated for May. Again speculation over price is rife with price levels varying depending on whether traders are long or short and with a lack of volume sales to support any true price.
OCP has refrained from shipping any MAP this month but has sold around 100,000 mt NPS 12-46-0+7S to various buyers in the $470s/mt CFR for April shipment in four lots. This will be used both for blending as well as direct application and could displace some demand for 11-44-0 where the additional sulphur is needed.
Mosaic has dropped its price once again, this time indicating a price out of Tampa of $460-463/mt FOB equating to the upper $470s/480/mt CFR Brazil level , still above current indications from the buyers.
Chinese MAP producers are foregoing MAP where they can and producing DAP instead in order to take advantage of better netbacks in Asian markets. With two major producers, Hubei Yihua and Wengfu not producing any MAP grades at all for export this year, it will be interesting to see how this affects availability of these grades for the Brazilian market through the key import months.
Brazil: Q1 P2O5 consumption falls 13% year on year
Despite some improvement in March, Brazilian P2O5 consumption fell by 13% overall in Q1.
Latest ANDA data show that consumption of P2O5 in March fell by 3% against 2014 and although an improvement on January and February, overall sales in Q1 fell 13% year on year.
Nevertheless despite not reaching the record levels of 2014, Brazil consumed 44% and 48% more P2O5 in Q1 this year than it did in 2013 and 2012 respectively.
Looking at import volumes there is a clear and sharp decline in the import quantity of almost all phosphate fertilizers, particularly MAP, in Q1 but only when compared with 2014. If we compare the volumes of MAP and DAP to 2013, imports this year were up by 19% and 15% respectively.
Average Q1 imports for the past three years, between 2011 and 2013, were 385,000 mt so this year's imports have been only marginally below this number.
This all reinforces the view that Q1 2014 was an anomaly prompted by higher crop prices, lower fertilizer prices (just $410-420/mt CFR Brazil when buyers first returned to the market) and greater confidence in the market arising from, amongst other factors, a more stable exchange rate. As reported previously in Fertilizer Week, this year Brazil has merely reverted to its normal seasonal buying patterns.
Brazil: Imports and Production (‘000 mt Product)
MAP Imports arrived in Q2 (‘000 mt product)
857 737
Taking all the available data, it becomes clear that availability in Brazil remains at manageable levels and comparable with last year, even accounting for the drop in consumption and a higher surplus at the end of 2014. As such, demand in Q2 should be relatively robust and even allowing for a less bouyant agricultural and economic backdrop, should translate into steady demand going forward.
Source: ANDA * excluding any surplus from previous years
CONAB has also released its monthly update projecteding total corn production at 79 million tonnes, with the full season crop seen at 30.3 million and safrinha 48.7 million. Although 10% of Mato Grosso safrinha planting in occurred outside the ideal planting window, conditions have been very good and encourage good crop growth. However, late April and early May will be the key yield determining period. CONAB has also raised its forecast for soyabean production to 94.3 million tonnes, exceeding the previous record by over 5 million tonnes.
EUROPE
Bulgaria: Iran emerges as Agropolichim's TSP primary market
Latest GTIS data for January show Agropolichim export 31,500 mt TSP to Iran that month. There were no other exports of TSP, DAP or MAP in January.
Bulgarian TSP exports reached a high of 226,000 mt in 2014 of which 157,000 mt were shipped to Iran, almost 70% of all Agropolichim's export availability. The balance was delivered into West Europe with 24,000 mt each to Belgium and France and small lots to other West European markets.
With more emphasis being given to TSP, export availability of MAP was lower in 2014 while DAP remained unchanged from the previous year. Just 20,000 mt MAP were exported last year in small lots to Romania, Hungary and Austria. Of the DAP, 42,000 mt went into Romania although some of this may have been transported further into Europe.
Poland: Further growth in NPK exports to Venezuela
GTIS data for January show 15,000 mt Polish DAP delivered into Germany.
Just 52,000 mt DAP were exported in 2014 which although a higher volume than in 2013, was still considerably lower than in previous years. Police has continued to place greater emphasis on the production of NPs and NPKs.
In January Police exported 49,000 mt NPKs including 20,000 mt for Venezuela and 11,000 mt for Denmark. Total exports in calendar year 2014 reached 346,000 mt, in line with the average since 2009. Of this quantity more than 40% was shipped to Venezuela, a market that has been steadily growing in importance for Poland over the past five years. Interestingly there were no exports to African markets in 2014, one of the reasons probably being the presence since last year of Moroccan NPKs in this region.
Poland exported no NPs in January. NP exports in 2014 reached 43,000 mt, largely split between Paraguay and Argentina.
Turkey: DAP tender scrapped and negotiations continue
Igsas scrapped its tender of April 10 for 10,000 mt DAP.
Gubretas continues to negotiate its annual phosphate requirement with GCT/Tunisia. An agreement is expected shortly.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP well committed through April
OCP is well committed through April but with limited DAP and MAP shipments.
OCP remains well committed through April and into early May with shipments to Africa, Europe and
Brazil. However, no DAP, MAP or TSP will be shipped to Brazil this month, instead OCP will ship 100,000 mt NPS 12-46-0+7S in four shipments sold in the mid $470s/mt CFR to various importers including Heringer. The product will be used both in blending and for direct application. OCP has indicated that it is not interested in the recent low prices seen in Brazil for MAP and if solid demand is still not evident in May, it will ship further quantities of phosacid into India.
Looking at the rest of the April line-up, as reported previously in Fertilizer Week, OCP will also load the balance of its Ethiopian cargoes, a total of 150,000 mt in three lots. The first has already loaded, the second will load shortly and the third will load at the end of the month/early May.
In addition it will load close to 100,000 mt DAP/MAP/NPKs to other African markets including 16,000 mt DAP to Mali/Senegal, 5,000 mt to the Ivory Coast, 6,000 mt MAP to Algeria, and 25,000 mt DAP/MAP to South Africa (mainly DAP). Additional NPKs will be delivered into Nigeria.
Just 25-30,000 mt DAP will have been delivered into Europe in April, sold between $510-515/mt FOB Jorf Lasfar including sales to Fertiberia/Spain.
OCP will also load two lots of MAP, one 6,000 mt parcel for Italy sold at a premium to DAP for non-fertilizer use, and the second cargo comprising 8,000 mt high grade MAP for Mexico.
The domestic market will take 25-30,000 mt DAP and NPKs in April. Morocco has raised its wheat import duty to 75% to help protect the local cereal crop, which is expected to see a bumper harvest of 10 million tonnes (6.7 million in 2014).
This all equates to around 360,000 mt DAP in product tonnes equivalent when calculated on a P2O5
basis. OCP has total granulation capacity of nearer 500,000 mt DAP per month but only if phosphoric acid is diverted from export use. Otherwise when phosacid exports are back up to the normal (higher levels i.e. this month) it is nearer 350,000 mt.
In addition to this, OCP will ship 110-120,000 mt P2O5 phosphoric acid to India, around 15,000 mt to Saudi Arabia and, regular quantities to Brazil and Europe and the normal 30-35,000 mt P2O5 to Pakistan from the Pak-Maroc joint venture plant.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Market quiet and rumours abound
As most of the traders and importers gather in China this week, rumours of cargoes being traded at lower prices, in the mid $470s/mt have been circulating.
So far there is little evidence backing up these reports and even a number of the major buyers are refuting these rumours. Although prices for Chinese tonnage may fall below the $480/mt CFR level, they are not expected to fall dramatically. Chinese suppliers are holding firm to current prices in the range of $460-470/mt FOB and show no intention to drop prices further in the near future. Indian CFR prices at or around $480/mt equates back to the mid/upper $460s excluding any trader's margin.
A delegation from PhosAgro visited India last week and further DAP/NPK cargoes are said to have been sold in addition to the NPK cargoes previously sold to Deepak and IPL and the DAP cargo to IFFCO; the DAP in these cargoes was priced in the mid $480s/mt CFR. Further details on the new business have not yet been confirmed and may not be until the NBS rates are formally announced.
Uttar Pradesh Co-op is expected to issue a re-tender for 100,000 mt DAP. Hudson was awarded the full quantity from the original tender at $478/mt CFR held in January but failed to deliver.
RCF has still not awarded any tonnage against its DAP tender of March 16 for 65,000 mt and it is widely thought that this tender will be scrapped.
The NBS rates have not yet been announced. Whereas last year they were announced at the beginning of April, in 2013 the announcement was not made until May 2.
Just over 1 million mt DAP has been confirmed to date, excluding new business from Russia. An estimated
2.4million mt DAP in the form of MoU agreements has been agreed to date between Saudi, Jordanian and Chinese suppliers and the major buyers for the current fertilizer year.
The latest port data information is as follows:
www.crugroup.comPhosphates Weekly Report | 13
India: MMTC issues new DAP tender
MMTC issued a DAP tender for 30,000 mt black or dark brown DAP (18-46-0) +/- 10%, closing 1400 hrs in New Delhi on April 23 for prompt shipment to Mundra, Vizag or Kakinada. Both technical and price offers will be opened on April 23. Offers to be remain valid for 15 days.
Bangladesh: Tender to be issued for private sector DAP/TSP requirement
The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to issue a tender to determine the supply of the forthcoming crop year's DAP and TSP import requirement via the private sector.
A total of 400,000 mt DAP and 200,000 mt TSP may be imported through private sector companies in 2015/16 and a tender to this effect is expected to be announced shortly, to close end April/early May.
This quantity is below the quotas given to the private sector last year for 2014/15 of 460,000 mt DAP and 250,000 mt TSP. Against this quantity 220,000 mt DAP were supplied from China and 136,000 mt DAP from Australia. China used to be a major supplier of TSP to Bangladesh, shipping 400,000 mt in 2009, but since 2012 there have been no imports of Chinese TSP due to alledged quality issues.
In calendar year 2014, against the long standing government-government agreement, BADC (Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation) imported an additional 150,000 mt DAP and 190,000 mt TSP from OCP/Morocco and 300,000 mt TSP from GCT/Tunisia according to GTIS and IFA data. A similar quantity will be allocated to the public sector again for 2015/16. OCP has been shipping more TSP in Q1 to Bangladesh due to supply issues from Tunisia.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Producers aim to hold firm on price
As much of the industry gathers in China this week, the main topic is the Chinese DAP price going forward.
Chinese producers are holding firm on the DAP price in the range of $460-470/mt FOB. There have been rumours of sales concluded in the mid $470s/mt CFR India but as yet no firm evidence to back them
up. Indian buyers are putting pressure on the Chinese to drop the price below $480/mt CFR, a price which gives a netback in the mid-high $460s/mt FOB China excluding traders' margin. Hubei producers generally have a freight advantage but producers like YUC are not only selling direct but also ship panamax vessels, again giving a more attractive netback.
As Indian demand slows down following the rush of buying seen in recent weeks, Chinese producers are taking advantage of the quieter period to undertake annual maintenance. Both YUC and Kailin are taking rolling turnarounds through April and into May which will reduce overall production by around 25-
30%.Wengfu started its month long maintenance programme this week, taking each of its two phosphoric acid units down at a time, thereby reducing overall production by 50%.
As reported previously in Fertilizer Week, both Wengfu and Hubei Yihua are now focusing almost exclusively on DAP, foregoing production of all grades of MAP in favour of DAP, and in the case of Wengfu, purified phosphoric acid or PPA. Having not sold any DAP into India at all in 2014, Wengfu will be looking to establish a presence in this all important market this year and already we have seen it sell three cargoes to CIL with a fourth on offer, at competitive prices relative to other suppliers.
Most producers are bypassing granular MAP for export due to the low netbacks currently being seen in the Brazilian market as the return on DAP remains significantly higher. Even at $470/mt CFR Brazil for granular 11-52-0, the netback would be close to $440/mt FOB China, well below the equivalent netback for DAP in India and more costly to produce.
It remains to be seen how the absence of two of the major producers will affect availability of MAP once the Brazilian season gets under way in earnest. Certainly prices will have to improve to prompt other producers, with the flexibility to switch between products, to move away from DAP and back to MAP especially as Indian DAP demand is forecast to see a solid improvement on 2014.
The issue of VAT has once again come to the fore. Latest speculation suggests that the government will re- introduce VAT on fertilizer sales from September this year at a rate of 13%. Producers will be able to offset VAT already paid on raw materials and other inputs against this rate. As such, CRU estimates that the VAT will mean that producers are looking at an additional cost of between RMB 50-100/mt on the cost of producing DAP.
The National Bureau of Statistics sees rice plantings in China expanding 1.2% this year, with corn up 1.9%. This will help to boost domestic fertilizer demand.
PHOSPHORIC ACID
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
NW Europe: Rollover agreed for Q2 phosphoric acid contracts
A rollover has been agreed for Q2 phosphoric acid contracts in NW Europe.
An agreement was reached last week between OCP and its customers in NW Europe for the Q1 price for phosphoric acid to be rolled over into Q2. As such the price range for CFR NW Europe will remain unchanged at $900-990/mt P2O5 CFR NW Europe for shipments up to and including June. Some Moroccan contracts were agreed at slightly higher prices but the overall range remains unchanged. Phosacid from non- Moroccan sources remains at the more competitive end of the price range while the upper end of the price range represents a higher grade Moroccan acid to customers taking smaller quantities.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Slow rate of Indian phosacid imports this month
Indian phosphoric acid imports appear to be relatively light so far this month.
A combination of higher prices, turnarounds and the delay in the announcement of the NBS rates appear to have caused phosphoric acid rates to slow down this month. However, with OCP planning to ship 110- 120,000 mt P2O5 in April and again in May to India, arrivals should soon start to pick up.
PHOSPHATE ROCK
EUROPE
Bulgaria: Syrian rock imports continue at a steady pace.
Agropolichim imported 25,000 mt Jordanian rock in January this year according to the latest GTIS data, along with a further 9,000 mt from Syria.
For calendar year 2014, phosphate rock imports reached a high of 578,000 mt comprising 231,000 mt from Syria, 216,000 mt from Morocco and 130,000 mt from Jordan. Syrian deliveries have remained at an average of 222,000 mt per year since 2012 but in the two previous years, the volume was well over 300,000 mt. The quantity from Morocco jumped last year, mainly displacing tonnage from Jordan.
Poland: More rock arriving from Senegal
Poland imported 100,000 mt phosphate rock in January this year, according to the latest GTIS data.
Cargoes came in from Morocco, Algeria, Senegal and a further 10,000 mt from Israel.
Volumes from Grupa Azoty's own reserves in Senegal have been increasing slowly but steadily since 2013. In calendar year 2014, a total of 220,000 mt Senegalese rock were shipped to Szczecin of which 150,000 mt were shipped in H2.
Overall imports in 2014 from all sources reached 1,266 million mt with Algeria supplying 564,000 mt or 45% of the total. Additional quantities came in from Morocco, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Togo, Turkey and Israel.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Tunisia: Severe curtailments again hit phosphate rock production
Yet again production of phosphate rock in Tunisia has been severely curtailed by sit-ins and local unrest.
For the second consecutive week, production and/or transport of rock has been halted at most of the major mines in the Gafsa region, including Redayef, Oum Larayes , Metaloui , Kef Eddour and Kef
Chefayer. According to local press reports, only the mine and beneficiation facilities at M'dhilla are currently operating. Unemployed protesters have been organising sit-ins at a number of the mines as well as the railway stations at Redayef and Oum Larayes while also blocking water supplies to the mines.
Rail transport is however operating between Metaloui and Mdhilla to feed the downstream plants at Gabes, M'dhilla and La Skhira (including Tifert). Private truck companies are also being used to transport the rock to the plants to meet ongoing off-shore commitments.
As a result of the problems, rock production is reported to have fallen to an estimated 15% capacity.
According to a statement made to the press by the director general of the CPG (Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa), Q1 production of phosphate rock failed to meet its original target of 1.56 million mt. Instead output fell almost 40% against Q1 2014, to just 604,000 mt in the first three months of this year compared with 983,000 mt last year.
It was only recently that the new government had announced that it had made the phosphate industry in Gafsa one of its priorities for its first 100 days of office, as reported by Fertilizer Week April 2. It had laid out plans for the production of rock to reach 500,000 mt per month in March, April and May but clearly this volume will not be reached in March/April. Officials have stated that continued efforts are being made to find solutions to "this very difficult situation".This included setting out a new set of measures at a high level meeting on April 13 to re-examine the cause of the problems, conducting an audit on the management approach of CPG and its subsidiaries to ensure "good governance", sending a government delagation to the region to address the problems first hand and dedicating a in Inner Cabinet meeting to the situation in May.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Q2 Rock contracts yet to get started
Negotiations are yet to start for Q2 phosphate rock contracts in India and may not until the NBS rates are formally announced giving clarity on the subsidy and market prices going forward.
Suppliers will be pushing for an increase in the wake of the $40/mt P2O5 hike in phosphoric acid prices for H1. Buyers will be citing the weak DAP market. DAP production in India via the phosphate rock and sulphur route remains the most attractive option, particularly given the lower sulphur prices. If buyers achieve a good price for Q2 rock which maintains this advantage, we can expect a robust level of imports going forward.
Imports to date for this calendar year stand at 2.31 million mt,a little less than this time last year. Imports for the full four months between January-April totalled 2.8 million mt with 837,000 mt arriving in April alone.
NP/NPKS
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Venezuela: NPK imports reach record high in 2014
Venezuela imported 605,000 mt NPKs in calendar year 2014, a 45% increase on the previous year and the third consecutive year of record imports, according to GTIS data.
During 2014, Venezuela imported 310,000 mt from Russia, almost double the volume supplied in 2013, with a further 144,000 mt shipped from Poland's Police plant. Meanwhile, the volume of imported NPKs from Colombia into Venezuela has been growing steadily over the past five years, up from less than 5,000 mt in 2009, to almost 125,000 mt in 2014.
