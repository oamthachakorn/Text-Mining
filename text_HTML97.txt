Tight availability leads buyers to
China
By Brendan Daly
Tight availability of sulphuric acid was demonstrated by recent business, particularly as sulphur-burnt sales out of China were able to find outlets in India and Mexico.
Indian demand for prompt spot product saw buyers willing to pay well above previous bid levels to obtain cargo from China as the lack of availability from Japan and South Korea became obvious.
Similarly, tonnes from China were reportedly required to cover a contractual obligation to Mexico’s Fertinal as other East Asian suppliers were unable to meet the requirement.

On the other hand, Chinese imports of sulphuric acid continued declining, with the February volume down 12% on the year.
Purchases by Mosaic and Bunge Argentina were roughly in line with expectations, in the mid-$80s/mt CFR and $90s/mt CFR respectively, though some sources suggest that European tightness may push prices up further. Yara Brazil and possibly Timac are likely to enter the market with spot demand soon, traders believe.
As it stands, European FOB levels remained stable given the lack of increases in CFR levels to Brazil or Morocco.
European talks for Q2 contracts have begun in earnest, but final settlements are likely a couple of weeks away. No major changes are expected, though some sellers believe that a small increase may be achievable.
Highlights of the week:
Mosaic buys in mid-$80s/mt CFR Bunge Argentina buys in $90s/mt CFR
India pays close to $80/mt CFR for Chinese product Chinese imports continue declining
European contract talks underway but no major change expected
Base Metals
Base metals were mixed over the week, as copper rebounded and zinc also showed some gains. A weaker US dollar combined with relatively low output has supported the copper price in recent days. LME copper was up to $6,134/mt for cash.
DAP & Sulphur
Speculation about a possible restart of MissPhos continue to swirl, due mostly to delays in any settlement in US bankruptcy court. That court will not rule until May about the disposition of the assets, in part because some investors and creditors in MissPhos are not convinced the plant should be liquidated. However, the need to replace the sulphuric acid unit on site (or run on purchased acid) continues to prompt industry players to predict that the complex will never produce phosacid again.
Global spot markets for sulphur were quiet with limited activity as buyers in most regions awaited further price declines. The upcoming April price announcements from Tasweeq and Adnoc should provide the market with more clarity.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices increased week on week to $1,650-1,700/mt CFR to $1,600-1,650/mt CFR China, continuing the rebound from the downward spiral the underwent from September 2014 to January of this year.

ARGENTINA
Bunge Argentina buys in $90s/mt
CFR
Bunge Argentina’s most recent enquiry was reportedly met in the mid-$90s/mt CFR, though the price was not confirmed.
The company's requirement is the result of its SSP facilities in Ramallo.
In October, the buyer reportedly bought a parcel of around 12,000 mt at a price of approximately $110/mt CFR.
Argentinian imports for 2014 totalled 64,482 mt based on one purchase of 14-17,000 mt per quarter.

BRAZIL
Mosaic buys in $80s/mt CFR
Mosaic’s tender for 12,000 mt of sulphuric acid for shipment at the end of April was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR.
Yara Brazil and possibly Timac are expected by traders to return to the market soon.
CHILE
Chilean spot demand anticipated
Sources continue to expect an increase in Chilean spot demand for Q2 following a lack of enquiries in the first quarter of the year.
Codelco’s Ministro Hales mine has still not reached full output because of issues with its roaster.
The continued delays should maintain import demand to the country.
MEXICO
Fertinal requirement covered by
Chinese tonnes
Sources suggested that Fertinal had bought 18-20,000 mt of product sourced from China in the mid-to-high $90s/mt CFR, but it is understood that the purchase was on contract rather than spot.
The movement of Chinese product is believed to have been in order to cover contractual requirements that could not be met by other East Asian suppliers.

PERU
Peru's January exports increase 10%
Peru’s exports of sulphuric acid for January increased 10.1% year on year to 108,421 mt, the highest monthly volume since September last year.
All of the January volumes went to Chile, demonstrating that Peru is satisfying a large share of Chilean demand.
However, total exports from Peru this year are expected to be lower than in 2014 as supply remains roughly stable while domestic demand is expected to increase.
EUROPE
Full settlement on European contracts a couple of weeks away
European Q2 contract talks are underway, though in some cases serious negotiations have yet to commence.
Most market participants expect prices to be a rollover, though some believe a slight increase may be achievable.
Sources suggested that final settlements may not be reached until after the Easter holidays in early April.
European FOB levels stable
European spot prices remained assessed at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, though most in the market believed that prices at the lower end of this range would be difficult to achieve in the current market.
Some suggested that the high $30s/mt FOB would be more reflective of the current market. However, with Brazilian levels in the $80s/mt CFR and no Moroccan trades reported above the $50s/mt CFR, such levels did not seem representative of current business.
Some key producers are not active in the spot market because of a lack of availability, as contractual offtake remains high.
The only turnarounds on the horizon currently in the region are Boliden’s Kokkola site at the end of May and Atlantic Copper’s Huelva site in September.
TURKEY
Turkish spot prices stable
Little change was recorded in Turkish spot prices for sulphuric acid.
Although some maintained that spot prices would be at least $50/mt CFR, others said that they struggled to even obtain $45/mt CFR.

MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
MOROCCO
Morocco resists spot offers as requirement set to decrease
Moroccan demand for spot sulphuric acid has declined and is expected to decline further in April, according to an OCP company source.
Although traders said that the buyer would need to pay in the
$60s/mt CFR for spot product, it seemed unlikely that deals at such levels would take place, as it obtains contractual product at a lower price while sulphur prices are also decreasing.
OCP’s new 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit is expected to be brought onstream in April. While the company’s phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus sulphuric acid available for use in OCP's other facilities.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
INDIA
Indian price ideas increasing
Indian prices were heard to be increasing as a result of persistent demand and tight availability.
Sources reported a trade done close to $80/mt CFR for a cargo from China, indicating the need for spot product in India and the lack of spot availability from Japan and South Korea.
The prompt need for product is reportedly driven by a delay in Paradeep Phosphates' sulphur burner.
Previous bids in the $50s/mt CFR, which were no longer sufficient to attract any demand from Asian sellers, are no longer apparent.

Chinese sulphuric acid imports continue decline
Chinese imports of sulphuric acid continued their decline, reaching 79,780 mt for February, 12% lower than February 2014.
Aside from January’s 76,753 mt, it is the lowest monthly volume since August 2013.

Weekly Market Report
26 March 2015
Almost all of the tonnes came from South Korea, although North Korea was the source of 815 mt and Taiwan the source of 561 mt.
Chinese exporters receive demand
Chinese exporters of sulphuric acid have benefited from a lack of spot availability from Japanese and South Korean sellers and prompt requirements for product to India and Mexico.
Sellers are optimistic that over the next few weeks there may be further Indian demand for Chinese acid.
In the domestic market, the pressure on suppliers has been increasing. In some regional markets such as Anhui province, the price of smelter acid dropped by RMB 20/mt.
Supply has therefore been depressed. Suppliers of acid have noted the bearish mood in the sulphur market, and are focused on ensuring the sales of planned quantities, meaning price is not their main concern.
