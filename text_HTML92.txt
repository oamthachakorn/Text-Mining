MARKET ANALYSIS
Market quiet as prices remain under pressure
By Brendan Daly
Sulphur markets remained quiet as buyers avoided purchasing and downwards pressure on prices persisted.
Further clarity was expected from Tasweeq and Adnoc’s price announcements next week.
Chinese buyers were comfortable with stocks at plants, though it is not clear how long they can hold off buying. Domestic port prices, as well as prices from Puguang, declined further and CFR price ideas followed suit. Elsewhere, trade data showed that Chinese February imports declined 7% on the year, though they remained a relatively healthy level considering the Spring Festival during that month.
A similar situation was apparent in India, with no new demand or spot activity reported. However, on the sell side, Reliance announced its latest 27,000 mt tender.
European contract talks for Q2 liquid sulphur continued, with buyers and sellers respectively pushing for similar-sized decreases and increases. A range of refinery maintenances has attributed to sellers’ confidence, while the strength of the dollar versus the euro is a key reason for buyers’ desired decrease.
Mediterranean price also remained under pressure, although limited availability from refinery turnarounds in the region has put a floor on price declines.
Similarly, OCP was pushing for lower spot prices in Morocco, and is expected to achieve a decrease on its Q2 contract price.
Highlights of the week:
China imports 793,658 mt in February
Chinese spot prices down further
Reliance issues latest sales tender
Views split on European contract outcome
Clarity awaited from OSP and QSP next week

MARKET UPDATES
EUROPE
European contract direction debated
Differences of opinion persisted over the likely outcome of negotiations for European Q2 liquid sulphur contracts.
While sellers are pushing for a $10-15/mt increase, buyers are pushing for a decrease of a similar size. Non-negotiating market players therefore believe that a rollover is likely.
Sellers argue that there is not much availability of sulphur for the coming months and this should push prices up. But buyers argue that exchange rate fluctuations mean that their dollar payments should decrease to protect margins while their euro-denominated incomings remain stable.
Traders viewed the market as balanced, though closer to tight than long.
A range of European refinery turnarounds are expected to keep the market from moving long, with production outages across oil refineries in Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean.
Refineries currently in or soon to begin maintenance included Mineraloelraffinerie Oberrhein (MIRO), Germany’s largest refinery, in Karlsruhe; Shell's refinery in Pernis, The Netherlands, which is Europe’s largest; ExxonMobil’s refinery in Port Jerome, France; and the Isab refinery in Italy, 80%-owned by Lukoil and 20% owned by ERG.
Work on Total’s Donges refinery in France was postponed to May from March, and is now scheduled to take place from May 4 to June
25.Total’s Lindsey UK refinery also recently underwent maintenance.
Earlier in March, the Pernis facility announced a planned turnaround that will last to late May.
Subsequently, Neste said its refinery in Porvoo, Finland, would start the largest turnaround in the refinery's history in April.
Maintenance at Mediterranean facilities also appears to be ramping up. In addition to the Isab maintenance, Greece's Aspropyrgos facility will go offline for scheduled maintenance from mid-April.
ITALY
Mediterranean prices inch down but availability limited
Sulphur prices in the Mediterranean region remained under downwards pressure, though relatively tight supply meant that price decreases were limited.
Sources pegged spot prices in the $135-140/mt CFR range, as buyers push for lower levels while prices decline elsewhere.

But the current turnaround at the Isab refinery in Priolo, Italy, 80% owned by Lukoil and 20% owned by ERG, and the upcoming turnaround at the Apropyrgos refinery in Greece are keeping availability limited.
On the other hand, sources report offers of both prilled and crushed product from Russia on the Black Sea.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
MOROCCO
Moroccan Q2 talks underway
North African contracts for Q2 purchases of sulphur are underway, and sources suggest that a decrease from the $160-165/mt CFR seems likely.
The scale of a possible decrease was yet to be determined.
A buy-side source suggested spot purchases had been achieved around $150/mt CFR and could likely be achieved below this level, though such traded levels have yet to be confirmed.
QATAR
Traders expect Barzan sales in April; Tasweeq QSP coming soon
Market sources suggested that the Barzan gas processing plant in Qatar may begin shipping product in April, though producer sources did not confirm.
The plant is expected to increase Qatar's sulphur production to 2.64 million mt in 2015 from 2.25 million mt the previous year.
As previously reported, market sources said that Tasweeq’s most recent tender for 35,000 mt was awarded in the mid-$150s/mt FOB, with some suggesting prices below $150/mt FOB, though the seller did not confirm. In fact, one source suggested that the seller had scrapped the tender and attributed the scrapping to availability issues. The tender closed on March 17.
Tasweeq is likely to announce its QSP for April on March 30.

UAE
Adnoc OSP due mid-week; Shah to commission end-Q2
Adnoc’s Shah project in the UAE is expected to be fully commissioned by the end of Q2 2015, according to a company source.
Some traders suggested it would start exports in April, but it is unlikely that consistent volumes will be available prior to full commissioning.
The project is forecast to be the largest coming on-stream in 2015, and will be one of the key contributors to market supply moving long over the next few years. It was previously delayed from Q1 to Q2.
Adnoc is expected to announce its official selling price for April around April 1.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
INDIA
Reliance issues latest 27,000 mt tender
Reliance issued its latest sales tender for 27,000 mt of sulphur with a laycan of April 15-19, with Port Bedi as loadport.
The tender closes on March 30.
The seller’s previous 27,000 mt that closed on March 9 was reportedly awarded to a Chinese trader in the $158-160/mt FOB Sikka range, well down from its tender in February, which was for 40,000 mt and was awarded around $180/mt FOB Sikka to a Chinese trader.
RCF has reportedly not decided on any award for its 5,000 mt sulphur tender that closed on March 10.
Elsewhere, the Indian market was quiet with limited demand.

ASIA AND OCEANIA
CHINA
Chinese February sulphur imports decline over Spring Festival
China’s February imports of sulphur declined 7% year on year to 793,658 mt, though the total for the first two months was still up as a result of the strong January volume.
Imports were expected to be somewhat lower than usual because of the Spring Festival falling in late February, leaving the market and ports mostly inactive for much of the second half of the month.
Saudi Arabia was by far the largest source of February imports, supplying 218,171 mt.
Other key suppliers were South Korea with 95,492 mt, Kazakhstan with 91,472 mt, Qatar with 90,364 mt, Japan with 75,822 mt, and the US with 61,497 mt.
Iran supplied on 46,502 mt, having been the source of more than 90,000 mt in every month since June 2014.
Qatar’s 90,364 mt was the largest monthly volume from the country since August 2014, while India’s 43,813 mt was the largest since July 2014.
Chinese market quiet as prices pressured downwards
Sulphur market activity in China was limited, as buyers held off making purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
Prices at ports decreased to RMB 1,280-1,340/mt FCA, with the lower end of the range at Nantong and Zhenjiang and the higher end at Fangcheng.
Sulphur stocks at ports declined to around 0.99 million mt, down considerably over the week. However, major buyers currently have ample stocks at plants, though they are likely to require replenishing soon.
Importers were reportedly negotiating for business at $165-170/mt CFR.
Sinopec’s Puguang moved down its price at Wanzhao port to RMB 1,300/mt FCA and its plant price to RMB 1,150/mt EXW. The operating rate of the refinery has been around two thirds of its average in 2014, with output around 4,000 mt/day. The plant inventory declined to around 70,000 mt from 80,000-90,000 mt but there was still pressure from high stocks at port.
