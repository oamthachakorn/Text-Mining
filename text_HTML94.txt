ANALYSIS
Acid market remains stable, limited changes seen in H2
Sulphuric acid players at this week's ESA conference in Malaga saw the market as mostly stable, with limited changes expected in H2.
Most believed that European availability is better than had been thought, as buyers seeking volumes in recent months have had no problems finding tonnes without any apparent upward pressure on prices.
Asia on the other hand continues to be seen as relatively tight, although some sources suggested that availability in this region is also better than many believe. Nonetheless, recent business has been reported as high as the low $30s/mt FOB Japan/South Korea.
For European sellers looking at the remainder of the year, Moroccan demand is likely to be lower than it has been in the first half of the year, but US and Brazilian business are likely to remain firm. US imports have been strong so far this year, even though spot activity has been limited. Trade data showed that despite a 47% year on year drop in May volumes Brazilian imports for the first five months of the year were still up 39%.
Namibian import demand is expected to persist through this year and potentially into 2016 too.
Turkish demand and prices remain relatively stable and are likely to remain roughly so over the coming months.
Although discussions for Q3 European contracts have yet to formally begin, no major changes, if any, are expected.
For Asian sellers, India remains a key source of marginal demand and is likely to continue buying in Q3, though potentially with less urgency than in recent months.
Some increase in Chilean spot activity is expected in H2, but most demand is believed to be met by contractual volumes.
Sources continue to see Mexico as a key supplier of marginal tonnes to Chile, even though its monthly exports are expected to decline from next month.
Chinese import business has been far lower than in 2014, but it is believed that the country could absorb more tonnes if needed.
Market participants are awaiting the restart of the PASAR smelter in the Philippines to see how much acid it will produce and what effect this may have on the market. Trade data showed that the smelter's running brought up Q1 2015 exports from the Philippines to 58,200 mt from nothing a year earlier.
Overall, both European and Asian FOB prices are expected to be slightly lower in H2, but any declines are expected to be small
Highlights of the week:
∙Market remains stable with only minor changes expected in H2
∙East Asian sales reported into $30s/mt FOB Japan/South Korea
∙European Q3 contracts expected roughly stable
∙Brazilian May imports down 47% on year but still up 39% YTD
∙Indian demand continues
∙Philippines Q1 exports reach 58,200 mt
Base Metals
Base metals slipped as LME copper posted its biggest loss since January as amid rising supplies. Stockpiles monitored by the LME have increased 90% in the past year, and on June 10 incresed by the most since March, or 3.1%. LME 3-month settled $150 lower at $5,880/mt.
DAP & Sulphur
Despite the sharp decline in Mosaic's export activity over the last couple of weeks, there are plenty of reasons to expect the company to use all of the sulphuric acid it produces. It will be loading panamax cargos of DAP to meet contractual obligations in India through July. In addition, the producer likely will load a panamax per month to India to supply its own system in that country through the summer and into the fall. Even though the US domestic fill season may be disappointing compared to prior years due to falling crop values, Mosaic has extensive consignment agreements with domestic distributors.
The sulphur market demonstrated further price rises without signs of dramatic increases. The current market tone is one of cautious optimism. Aramco posted a price of $144/mt FOB for July, up $2/mt from June. The seller then reportedly fully sold out for the month a day after finalising the price. Some in the market had been expecting a slightly higher level in the $145-148/mt FOB range, although CFR levels have not yet increased to levels that can support such a level. Market participants will be awaiting settlement of Tasweeq's next 35,000 mt tender, which closes next week.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
NORTH AMERICA
Mexico: Boleo remains key source of tonnes
Market participants have continued to note the important effect that sulphuric acid export volumes from the Boleo mine in Mexico have had on the global market, and expect it to remain an important contributor, although volumes are expected to decline over coming months.
Chilean buyers, in particular, have seen it as an important alternative to East Asian supplies, as Chilean imports from Mexico increased from 58,159 mt over the whole of 2014 to 117,871 mt over just the first four months of 2015.
But, as previously reported, Boleo's exports of sulphuric acid out of Santa Rosalia port are likely to decline from July onwards.
It has exported around two cargoes of 18-20,000 mt per month so far this year, but this is likely to decline to around one cargo per month from July as it ramps up its plant.
Boleo began producing copper January 17, and has been a key source of marginal acid supply, with most cargoes going to Chile, although some material has gone to Brazil.
US: Spot quiet but overall volumes strong
The US sulphuric acid import spot market remains relatively quiet, although volumes to the country have been high.
Market participants continue to peg spot prices in the $70-80/mt CFR range.
Contractual business has been strong, and deals that have been done in recent months have in many cases been concluded directly between buyers and sellers with no trader intermediary.
US buyers have resisted price increases as current availability for volumes both domestically and from overseas has not been excessively tight.
But the country's overseas imports are expected to continue increasing over the coming years as availability from neighbouring Canada declines. As previously reported, US imports for the first four months of this year were up 8.4% from the same period last year at 1.12 million mt. Although the majority came from Canada and much of the remainder from Mexico, the US has continued to increase the proportion of its imports coming from Europe.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Imports down in May but still up YTD
Brazil's sulphuric acid imports for May fell 46.7% year on year to 30,729 mt, but total imports for the first five months of the year remained 39% higher on the year at 242,491 mt.
Spain was the main source of May volumes, supplying 14,991 mt, while the remainder came from Sweden (8,925 mt) and Belgium (6,811 mt).
Spot import prices to Brazil remain pegged at $85-90/mt CFR, and spot sales to the country have been in the $80s/mt CFR for several months.
Chile: Spot activity lacking, term volumes meet demand
The Chilean spot market remains quiet, as most demand has been met by contractual volumes and some sellers have likely been displaced by new volumes from Mexico.
Spot enquiry is expected to pick up slightly in the second half of the year, though it is not yet clear how much of buyers' requirements have not been met by contracts.
Sources peg notional spot prices at a similar level to contracts of around $80/mt CFR, though some buyers have argued that this would not be achievable and prices would more likely be around $75/mt CFR. However, such levels would be difficult to obtain given high East Asian FOB levels and high production costs for sulphur burners such as the one in Mexico.
The spot assessment remains $80-85/mt, with the higher end of $90/mt CFR having recently been brought down as it is not believed that spot business close to this level has been achieved in recent weeks, and what limited spot business has been reported this quarter is understood to have been around $80/mt CFR or slightly higher.
Chilean imports for 2015, including volumes from neighbouring Peru, are expected to total 2.4-2.5 million mt, up from last year's 2.25 milllion mt.
EUROPE
Europe: FOB spot levels steady, fundamentals balanced
European spot prices continue to be assessed at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with little change in prices reported over the past several months.
Some have suggested business in the high $30s/mt FOB, but this is unlikely to be representative given stable CFR prices over recent months across countries that import European tonnes, and even lower prices in some cases, with recent business to Argentina reported in the mid-$80s/mt CFR.
Despite repeated reports of tight availability, buyers have had no difficulty obtaining desired spot cargoes, leaving little impetus for any price climbs.
The only recent turnarounds have been at Boliden's Harjavalta and Kokkola smelters in Finland. The producer is also planning a turnaround at its Rönnskär plant in September, with the only other European smelter turnaround currently on the horizon in the region is Atlantic Copper's Huelva site in September.
In Q2 2016, Aurubis is expected to shut down its smelter in Pirdorp, Bulgaria smelter for around two months, though this is likely to be at least partially offset by increased production at its Hamburg site.
As reported in Fertilizer Week's most recent short term forecast, published last week, European FOB levels are expected to inch down in H2, but the decline is expected to be limited, with prices remaining mostly in the $20s/mt FOB by the end of the year.
Turkey: Demand and prices reported stable
Turkish demand for sulphuric acid is expected to remain relatively stable over the remainder of the year and in 2016, with new demand offsetting demand that is exiting the market.
Although Toros's new sulphur burner is expected to reduce demand for acid imports, this is likely to be offset by a similar volume of new demand from the Meta Nickel plant.
Sources report that Meta Nickel has already been purchasing imports of sulphuric acid, though it will be some time before it reaches capacity.
The new capacity at Gordes in Turkey is forecast by CRU to boost nickel-leaching based acid demand to around 50,000 mt in 2015, gradually increasing to 190,000 mt by 2018.
Spot prices remain pegged at $40-50/mt CFR Turkey, though sources suggest that most business would be at the upper end of this range.
Turkey: April imports up 69% year on year
Turkey’s April imports of sulphuric acid increased 68.8% year on year to 53,809 mt, bringing imports for the first four months up 5.1% at 196,256 mt.
The increase has offset the low volumes of previous months. As reported last week, Q1 imports were down 8%.
Almost all of the April tonnes came from Aurubis's Pirdop smelter in Bulgaria, with only 950 mt from Italy and 485 mt from Germany.
Europe: Q3 contracts expected relatively stable
Most market participants currently expect a rollover or a slight increase on Q3 European contracts for sulphuric acid.
Some argue that the weak euro has hurt sulphur burners who buy their sulphur in dollars but sell their acid in euros
Some have also argued that current export spot prices of $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe are offering more attractive netbacks than European contract levels.
Contracts for Q2 were assessed at €57-80/mt CFR, and have been at a similar level for over a year, with only slight increases of around €2-3/mt at the lower end of the range over that period. It is worth noting that the upper end of the range is not representative of standard business.
But many in the market continue to think that a rollover remains the most likely outcome, as both buyers and sellers are relatively satisfied with current levels and market fundamentals in the region have not changed much recently and are not expected to change much over Q3.
Even those expecting an increase believe that only a single-digit rise would be achievable. Official discussions have yet to begin.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Namibia: European sellers confident of demand
Namibian demand for sulphuric acid imports from Europe is expected to continue through 2015 with some demand likely in 2016, though after this it is likely to reduce to negligible levels.
There is concern that the startup of Dundee Precious Metals' Tsumeb sulphuric acid plant in June may further diminish demand for European imports, but export sellers say that Namibian buyers have indicated that they do not expect supply for Tsumeb until 2016, and that buyers are likely to take some European tonnes even after they begin consuming volumes from Tsumeb.
CRU forecasts sulphuric acid supply from the plant of around 140,000 mt in 2015, with this increasing to 310,000 mt/year from 2016.
Dundee Precious Metals entered a supply agreement with Rössing Uranium for the annual purchase of 225,000 t/year of sulphuric acid. Other supply agreements are currently under negotiation with Weatherly International and Protea Chemicals.
The plant will therefore remove the requirement for Rössing to import acid from 2017 at the latest, leaving one less outlet for exporters.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Spot demand still strong
Demand from India for spot sulphuric acid cargoes remains strong, according to market sources.
Spot price ideas are mostly in the $60-70/mt CFR range, although traders suggested that prices would be higher for smaller cargoes to more difficult ports. However, some Indian buyers reported weaker buying interest and suggested price ideas in the $50-55/mt CFR range.
PPL's sulphur burner in Paradip is expected to be delayed until September-October, and market participants believe this will support Indian demand, though many expect a gradual decline from the recent high levels of prompt demand.
There is currently a backlog of six cargoes arriving in India in June, according to traders.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Philippines: Q1 exports reach 58,200 mt
The Philippines exported 58,200 mt of sulphuric acid in Q1, trade data show, up from nothing in Q1 2014.
Of the total, 49,800 mt was exported in February with the remainder in March. All of the 8,400 mt exported in March went to Malaysia. Of the February total, 22,000 mt went to Indonesia, 16,800 mt went to Malaysia, and 11,000 mt went to Australia.
As previously reported, exports of sulphuric acid from the Philippines climbed to 317,732 mt in 2014 from 98,387 mt in 2013. Exports from the country have begun to play a larger role in the regional trade dynamic as Glencore's PASAR smelter has operated while adjacent consumer Philphos has remained closed.
The PASAR copper smelter shut on April 16 for an estimated 60 days of planned maintenance and work to increase capacity.
China: Market quiet but firm prices reported
Market participants reported decent import demand for sulphuric acid to China, although activity this year has been lower than in 2014.
Price ideas were in the $30s/mt CFR, though no recent trades were confirmed.
Two Lions is currently focused on Chinese sales, as domestic prices have been increasing and international offers from Japanese and South Korean sellers are lower than the price level the producer would be seeking.
Previously, the seller has achieved prices into the $50s/mt FOB when buyers have needed to cover prompt requirements and have been unable to obtain product elsewhere.
Japan/South Korea: Spot prices strong amid tightness
Asian spot prices for exports remain assessed at $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, and there has been some business reported slightly above this level, though it has yet to be confirmed.
South Korean producers reportedly recently sold 120,000 mt to traders for H2 at prices from the high $20s/mt FOB to the low $30s/mt FOB.
Tight availability has meant that buyers have had limited options to meet spot requirements and have had to accept higher prices in some cases.
The lack of spot availability and high CFR levels to India supported the increase, and India remains the main source of spot demand. Relatively high Chinese import prices in the $30s/mt CFR were also reported.
It is believed that $20/mt FOB is now the floor for East Asian spot exports.
A lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi's Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko's Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc's Onahama smelter.
The PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc's Onsan smelter shut May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days.
Much uncertainty centres on how much PASAR is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts.
Later in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters.
