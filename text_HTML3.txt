Overview
Urea and DAP continue to fall, nitrates slipping
The collapse in the international urea market has pressured European urea prices down. Since late January, urea prices have dropped a further €10/t in Germany, France and Spain, and about €25/t in Italy. But urea prices appear to be set for a short rally, with traders covering short sales and taking some long positions for February shipment.
There has been some softening in nitrates prices, but not comparable with urea. The upshot of this is that AN and CAN look overpriced per unit N, relative to urea, and the markets expect producers to drop their prices to restore some bal- ance. CAN stocks are fairly high in most countries at present, and there is some hope amongst those with stocks that price drops will be delayed until existing stocks have been sold.
The euro strengthened significantly this week, to €1.12/$ at press time. For much of last month it ranged between €1.08- 1.09/$. This improves the outlook for business somewhat
-importers will find dollar-priced fertilizers slightly cheaper.
At the same time, much of the requirement for the com- ing season has been booked already, and the outlook is for weaker fertilizer prices in the medium term, so it may not prompt much stock-building.

Germany
Urea and DAP prices slide again
Business at all levels is at a standstill as the market continues to wait for the season to
start, after which farmers will return to replenish. Producer stocks are mounting as production facilities continue to run while retailers and wholesalers are understood to be sitting on high levels of unsold stock. Long positions are seen at all levels of the supply chain and no buying will take place until the season begins. With the first application covered and product already delivered to the farmer, the next round of buying is not expected to take place until March/April for the second and third applications.
The lacklustre demand has seen urea and DAP prices con- tinue to trend down, while downwards pressure is also being placed on prices of all other products. For now, prices for CAN, UAN and NPKs are holding, mainly due to a lack of business.
to the sales but there are unconfirmed reports that Belor has been offering this product at €225/t fca Ghent.
The restart of OCI's Geleen CAN plant is due to begin next week but OCI has not yet started to offer any of this fresh tonnage until the restart is further progressed. No significant volumes are expected until end-March/April at the earliest.
UAN
Prices continue to be indicated at €173-175/t fca/ex-tank Hamburg amid a lack of business. Tanks are full with suppli- ers awaiting the application season to begin before starting deliveries in order to free up storage space.
ASN
There is very little interest for ASN now with most of the 2015-16 requirements already booked. It is estimated that only around 10pc of total requirements for this fertilizer year still needs to be purchased. Prices of ASN are still indi- cated at around €265/t cif inland.
CAN
Prices continue to be indicated at €225-230/t cif inland. West European producers are reported to be offering at €228-230/t cif inland but buyers wanting large quantities are likely able to achieve a lower price. But there is no new business. It will likely remain this way until farmers begin to replenish stocks. Uncertainty over the direction of the CAN price is also deterring buyers from the market. Distributors are hopeful that prices will be maintained through March to allow CAN already priced and in store to be applied. If there is any adjustment to the CAN price, it will likely take place in time for the second or third application.
On imports, NF Trading is understood to have delivered around 25,000t of Ukrainian CAN into Ghent late January, which has all been sold to Belor. No price has been attached

Urea
Granular urea prices remain soft and have dropped to €230- 235/t fca, compared with €240-250/t fca two weeks ago. Some small lots are reported to have been concluded within this range for February-March delivery open origin, but most buyers are reluctant to buy in a falling market. It is thought that prices below this level may be achievable for delivery end-March/April.
Forwards sales of granular urea are also being offered for June 2016-January 2017 delivery at the suppliers' option at prices around €220-225/t fca. But there is little uptake of this offer as buyers remain cautious amid weak sentiment in the international market.
Licensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP
Prilled urea is on offer at €219-223/t fca German Baltic Sea ports. Again, there is very little interest on the buy side.
Trammo is in the freight market to load around 6,000t of urea in Ust Luga on 6-8 February for shipment to Lubeck.
DAP
DAP prices are indicated slightly lower this week at $420- 425/t fca while a small rally in the value of the euro versus the US dollar late this week will also push prices down further in euro terms. But there has been no firm business lately and such prices are only indicative. Some market players believe that prices sub-$420/t fca may be achievable in this current environment. Material is not required for ap- plication until April although bulk blenders will need product slightly earlier so there is still time to buy. Moreover, weak international DAP prices are keeping buyers on the sidelines, uncertain of the right moment to step in.
NPKs
There is little interest in NPKs at the moment but some buying is expected to emerge March/early April for spring application. The price of 15-15-15 continues to be indicated at around €335-340/t cif inland. Borealis continues to hold its 15-15-15 price at €340/t cif inland while Polish 15-15-15 is also offered within this range.
Borealis is also offering NP 20-20-0 at a similar price to 15-
15-15 while its 28-8-8 and 14-10-20 grades are indicated €10/t lower.
PhosAgro is understood to have recently delivered a small parcel of 15-15-15 and NP 20-20-0 to Germany.
Potash
K+S' KornKali is priced at €244/t cif inland for February, ris- ing by €4/t from its January price. Another €4/t increase is scheduled each month for March and April. These increases are in contrast to the price trend seen for granular MOP, where prices are under pressure. Last indications for granu- lar MOP are at €280-285/t fca Antwerp/Ghent.
France
AN/CAN static, Urea/UAN/DAP dip further
The French nitrates market has remained quiet awaiting the start of application in the next
two weeks. Market prices for AN/CAN are unchanged but much lower urea prices are expected to result in a correc- tion in nitrate prices when the existing high-priced stocks have been depleted.
Some urea business has taken place at €220-224/t fca, but the rally in the market in midweek means that some offers have been withdrawn. It is still too early to say whether this signals an end to the downward spiral in urea prices. But what is clear, is that the current gap between urea (and UAN) and CAN/AN is too large and has to be addressed.
Phosphate prices have also continued to trend lower in- ternationally and this has had a knock-on effect on offers into France. Offers are some $15/t lower than in January at $420-425/t fca, the equivalent of €375-380/t fca, but the fall has come too late to have much influence on spring demand. MOP suppliers are facing very sluggish demand and are re- ducing prices continually to take orders.
AN
The AN 33.5pc market is unchanged. There is no demand for fresh lots. Distributors and farmers have stocks they are waiting to move when application starts later this month.
Prices for French-produced AN remain at €300-303/t cpt bulk. Supply to the French market appears good and buyers are waiting for new producer prices from Yara. The producer is understood to be sold out for the next two weeks and is

only offering for second half February delivery.
Borealis is booked through February and should begin offer- ing March tonnes shortly. In contrast, Eurochem has product available from stock to sell.
Buyers are expecting market prices to move lower in France, following the downtrend in urea prices. This is not expected to happen until wholesalers and retailers have depleted stocks and are ready to re-fill inventories. The gap between delivered prices of AN and urea is currently some €50/t, which is highly likely to impact future AN prices.
AN imports are quoted at around €270-275/t fca but buyers will not confirm new purchases until they know what domes- tic prices will be for the next sales.
CAN
The situation for the CAN 27pc market is similar to AN, in that prices are unchanged at €248-250/t cpt bulk. The larger than normal price gap between CAN and urea remains an issue and French distributors will be looking for a price cor- rection ahead of the next round of purchasing in March.
Supply remains adequate in spite of OCI’s prolonged out- age at its 1.4mn t/yr Geleen unit. OCI is planning to restart the first line on 8 February and if all goes smoothly the unit should be fully operational by the second-half of March.
In the meantime, the French CAN market is still at a stand- still waiting for the application season to begin. Farmers are expected to start applying nitrogen fertilizers in the next two weeks if the weather permits. So far this spring, the weather has been extremely mild and applications could well start earlier than normal. However, this will depend on how much rain there is as too much rainfall will limit spreading.
UAN
UAN 30 prices have dropped over the past week, with sales made at €155-157/t fca Rouen for February-April delivery. The price has fallen to the level implied by the most recent sale in Egypt - $140/t fob - even though only 5,000t were sold from there and not for France.
Stocks in Rouen and throughout the distribution chain are high awaiting the application season to begin around 10-15 February.
Forward offers appeared in the market this week at around €145/t fca Rouen for June to October delivery. It is not clear
if there is any volume behind these levels as yet as it could be traders testing the market. The price is equivalent to about $130/t fob Egypt.
The 2015-16 season is shaping up to be a strong one. The French UAN solutions market is estimated to be about 90pc covered based on usage of approximately 2.2-2.3mn t in a normal year. Sales are expected to exceed this level because of some switching away from higher-priced AN/CAN. But it is still too early to estimate by how much.
Abu Qir will hold a sales tender on 8 February for 25,000t of UAN for 11-15 February loading. The last tender saw one 5,000t lot sold at $140/t fob to Trammo for Spain. Abu Qir told bidders its breakeven price is $140/t fob.
The next tender will test that level again. The US market is paying no better than $130/t fob Egypt/Black Sea and it is not clear whether anyone in France has space for 25,000t of UAN for prompt shipment.
Russian producers are supplying European markets in Febru- ary. Eurochem will load 35,000-40,000t of UAN 32 in Novo- rossisk in February for Rouen/Ghent. It is checking freight, with rate indications in the high-$10s/t for Black Sea-France, and has also fixed 15,000t to load in Klaipeda for Rouen at $19/t.
Agronova has fixed several vessels for February loading in Sillamae, including 10,000t to La Pallice at $26-27/t; 18,000t to Rouen at $21/t; 10,000t to Ghent at $20/t; and 33,000- 35,000t for the US east coast at $35-36/t.
Urea
Granular urea prices in France have been following the inter- national market lower.

Offer prices dropped to €220-224/t fca this week, helped by the stronger euro, which moved back up to $1.11-1.12 on Thursday. Demand is largely covered for February, with urea still in store in major ports to meet it, and new buying is for March-April arrival.
A 25,000t Kuwaiti granular urea cargo has been booked for second half February loading that is expected to move to France. Freight is estimated at $17-18/t Shuaiba-French Bay.
Ameropa was in the freight market for 4,000t of Algerian urea for shipment to Sete during 25-30 January.
The turnaround in the market this week meant that some traders withdrew low offers and began indicating at higher levels of €230-235/t fca La Pallice. This is equivalent to the $224/t fob paid in Egypt most recently for February loading. Egyptian urea sold out quickly when it became evident the market was turning. Some Algerian urea remains to be sold, however.
Around 60pc of the French urea market is estimated to have already been covered with some 450,000-480,000t still to be purchased for the balance of the winter cereal season and the upcoming corn application in May-June.
Traders have begun to offer granular urea for delivery in the second half of 2016, with quotes at €225/t fca in larger ports for delivery July-December at suppliers’ option. The price nets back to $212-215/t fob Egypt at current exchange rates, or about $190/t fob Middle East.
DAP/TSP
DAP prices have corrected downwards this week by around €15/t, with offers sinking to €380-385/t fca Rouen. This is down from at €395-400/t fca in late January. Suppliers, keen to get orders, are fighting for market share. The drop in price has however come too late to be of much use this sea- son as raw materials for blending have largely been covered.
Lesser competition in the TSP market has kept market prices steady at around $355/t fca Rouen for February.
MOP
Buying interest for granular MOP has remained minimal. Competition for sales from all suppliers is strong and spot offers in in Rouen are around €2/t lower at €276-278/t fca in line with lower offers into Benelux ports. Distributors are wary of committing to new sales as the price of urea and DAP continues to fall.
AN imports stall, no price increase for NPKs
Application time is imminent in some areas –
but some farmers still appear to be reluctant to commit to purchases of nitrogen products. With price erosion seeming endless to the farmer, this is understandable.
The much-anticipated logistical difficulties are not, as yet, manifesting themselves. Orders are being executed prompt- ly, giving those yet to order some comfort that their ‘just-in- time’ tactics are justified.
AN
Domestic AN is going on farm in the range £215-£220/t bagged. This suggests that a delivered to merchant price of £210-£215/t bagged is being supported by CFFUK and Yara. But farmers still expect further price drops.
Import AN prices have dropped significantly this week. Fresh Lithan and Pulan tonnes are being offered at €240-250/t cif bagged, reflecting £185-192/t cif bagged, or £195-202/t fca bagged. This is down about £10/t from the end of Janu- ary. Imported material was previously uncompetitive with domestic, but this price cut may help.

N+S
N+S products do not currently reflect the softened AN pric- es. 27N 30SO3 and 29N 20SO3 are trading at a £5/t premium at £220-£225/t bagged delivered to farm.
Imported ASN is offered now in the range £200-205/t fca bagged, down from offers on the same terms at about £203- 210/t at the end of January.
Urea
Offers are in range £215-£220/t bagged delivered farm, equivalent to £200-205/t fca bagged - down from offers at the end of January at £205-208/t fca bagged. Buyers focused on cost/kg N over agronomic efficiency are being tempted to switch from AN – urea is at £0.47/kg N and AN is at £0.63/ kg N.
Recent arrivals include Algerian product from Ameropa into Birkenhead.
A March offer of north African product was heard at around $255/t cif bulk, equivalent to about £200/t fca bagged.
PK/NPKs
Whilst some sales are being made, as with AN, buyers seem reluctant to commit. Moves to raise prices have been largely unsuccessful, and blended 20-10-10 remains priced around £235/t delivered to merchant. CFFUK compound is being traded at around £250/t delivered to merchant.
PKs also do not yet reflect the indicated price rise and 0-24- 24 remains in the range £235-240/t delivered.
Phosphate/Potash
Phosphates prices are unchanged on little trade. DAP is be- ing sold at £340/t fca bags, while TSP is priced at £265/t fca bags.
Granular MOP has stabilized at around £220/t fca bags.
Italy
Prices drop, demand yet to rise
Prices have dropped across the board domesti- cally for February, with a particularly sharp 
drop for granular urea as Yara adjusted its offer price for material from its Ferrara plant. Nitrates also saw price de- creases, with CAN slipping by about €5-10/t and AN a similar amount.
The international situation is similar. Importers are target- ing substantial price decreases for DAP, and look likely to achieve them basis latest sales of Tunisian DAP into Turkey, though OCP is holding firm for now.
Other than some demand from wheat growers in central Ita- ly, little demand is reported still. There is talk of a logistics squeeze if demand comes in a short burst, but this might be better than the hand-to-mouth purchases at the moment.
Urea
Urea prices have dropped across the board, as Yara and other suppliers adjusted their prices to better reflect inter- national markets and to stimulate demand.
Yara has lowered its prices for granular urea ex-Ferrara, now at €290/t fca big bags. Previously it was at €315/t fca big bags.
Other suppliers are in a broad range. Borealis is selling at €270-275/t fca big bags in Ravenna, with other suppliers reporting business at €280-290/t fca big bags.
There is little apparent demand for imports at present, with many reluctant to take further positions in the falling market. Prices in Egypt have dropped again this week, with business done in a range of $215-225/t fob. This would trans- late to about $235/t cfr, equivalent to around €235-240/t fca big bags. But the market is likely to rally for a period, with traders covering shorts and taking long positions for Febru-

ary shipment.
Egyptian urea production was cut following the explosion of a gas pipeline between Port Said and Damietta on Sunday 24 January. Mopco is the most affected exporter, offline since the explosion and expected to be down for a further two weeks. Other producers went offline temporarily, or reduced operating rates, but are now running again. EFC is running at 70pc capacity, and directing 40pc of its output to the Egyptian market.
There is a freight inquiry by Trammo to load 4,000t of Egyp- tian urea ex-El Delkheila or Abu Qir during 1-3 February for shipment to Barletta.
CAN
Yara is offering its CAN 26 at €255/t fca big bags, down €10/t from January. Others report offers between €245-250/t fca big bags, down by around €5/t since the end of January.
Good demand is reported from central Italy, where nitrogen is being applied to wheat. Borealis is selling here at €265- 270/t delivered bagged.
As in other European markets there is some concern over the potential for a substantial price drop once demand starts, to realign CAN with urea. The nitrate premium to urea is particularly strong at present and may lead buyers to switch to urea. But across Europe there is a general feeling that producers will wait for existing stocks to be depleted before announcing price drops in March-April.
AN is on offer at about €290/t fca big bags in the north of Italy, down about €10/t since late January.
Italy DAP vs ARA rapeseed
DAP Italy €/t (LH Axis)
Rapeseed OME RED fob ARA $/t (RH Axis)
OCP is indicating unwillingness to go below $435/t fob, but is only offering 20,000-30,000t to Europe in February anyway. The producer is understood to be trimming output to match perceived demand.
NPKs
Yara is offering 15-15-15 at €355/t fca big bags, but has done business a few euros lower.
Borealis has lowered its 15-15-15 price in line with raw mate- rial prices to €340/t fca big bags in Ravenna, or €350-360/t delivered bagged.
The market is said to be slow, with main demand expected in March.
Indagro was in the freight market for 3,000t of NPKs for load- ing in Nea Karvali, Greece, during 28-31 January for shipment to Ravenna.
DAP
The DAP market remains inactive domestically, though im- porters are still looking to book new cargoes.
DAP offers are heard at €440-455/t fca big bags, but there is little demand. There are rumours of offers much below this too, which would better reflect the prices of import cargoes arriving January-February.
GCT January cargoes are arriving, sold largely at prices equivalent to $445-450/t cfr, or the mid-€420s/t fca big bags. But importers are now targeting $390-400/t fob for North African origin, which would equate to about $410- 420/t cfr. Indeed GCT has made sales of small lots to Turkey for February shipment netting back to about $380/t fob.
Spain
Hand-to-mouth urea buying
As is often the case, weather conditions are playing a major role in Spanish fertilizer
demand. At present there is a regional split with insufficient rain in parts of the south, and excessive rainfall in parts of the north. In both cases, fertilizer demand is being under- mined.
Traditionally CAN application would be starting now in the north, but this year, fields are too wet to enter. Latest estimates suggest consumption could be another 10-15 days away. In the south, urea application is underway but yet to gather any pace because it is too warm and there is a lack of moisture in the ground.

To add to sellers’ woes, international prices of all the lead- ing fertilizers are trending downwards. Late this week, urea showed some signs of stability. But buyers remain wary as urea has seen sharp price declines since the start of the year and it is unclear how long this stabilisation will last.
The net result of these two factors – unfavourable weather and weak international pricing – is cautious, hand-to-mouth, just-in-time domestic buying. Sellers talk of minimal demand and only for small lots if at all. Stocks at the importer and distributor level are high awaiting greater movement among retailers and farmers.
If the weather does improve then domestic consumption should increase. Undoubtedly, buyers will remain cautious wanting small lots for prompt delivery/laycan dates, but at least this will allow greater movement to the field and see products transferred along the domestic system. This will allow importers to step in again.
Urea
There is some granular urea import interest but caution over falling prices and loading delays is hampering actual trade. Granular urea is offered at $252/t cif including 90 days’ credit for immediate loading and at prices below $250/t
cif including 90 days’ credit for laycan/arrival not fully fixed. Importers are aware that anything arriving in March may be too late for the current cereals application pe- riod, but remain cautious because of the recent urea price trend.
Among recent imports, Medifer is understood to have 4,000t of Algerian urea arriving in Alicante. Trammo was checking freight for 5,000t Arzew to Valencia, loading early this week. Medifer’s 5,000t Ameropa/Arzew cargo is due to arrive in Seville imminently.
Reports of a large prilled cargo booked for Huelva could not be confirmed.
In the domestic market, Fertiberia is priced at around
€240-245/t fca but it is understood it will be competitive amid falling granular prices. NIC is offering granular urea at €260/t fca, but granular is also heard to be available at prices below this level.
CAN
Normally CAN application would be starting now, but exces- sive rain in the north and northwest has delayed the season. It is estimated that around 10-15 days are needed to dry the fields out. There is a lot of product in the system already and prices are under downwards pressure.
Fertiberia’s list price of €246/t fca is obsolete with the market well below this. CAN 27 is widely available at around €245/t delivered or at equivalent levels of €225-230/t fca/ ex-warehouse.
UAN
It is not the high season for UAN 32 application and the dry weather in the south has halted any potential usage for now. Domestic tanks are full with some buyers not taking receipt of the volumes ordered. Prices remain around, or slightly below, €200/t ex-tank/fca.
DAP
There is minimal DAP demand in the domestic market, partly because of the time of year and also because of falling international prices. Fertiberia has withdrawn its list prices, awaiting firm demand. It has no further imports lined up for February from OCP at this stage, and is instead focused on liquidating stocks.

There are a wide range of price indications across Spain, but no activity to confirm accurate levels. In the south indica- tions range €420-440/t fca/ex-warehouse, with certain importers trying to keep levels towards the high end of this range based on the expensive stock being held. But in the north, DAP is available at around €435-440/t delivered basis supplies in Bayonne, France. This would reflect nearer €420/t fca. There are also indications around €400/t fas duty paid, ex-Russia.
ever-diminishing urea price. UAN prices in Benelux ports have also pulled back with latest offers at €156-157/t fca for February/March delivery and new season at €143-145/t fca June-October. DAP prices have also lost further ground falling by another $5-10/t with latest offers at $420-425/t fca Benelux ports. Competition for potash sales has seen granu- lar MOP prices dip by €2/t to €275-277/t fca Ghent/Antwerp or €283-285/t cif inland.
The much-talked about 25,000t cargo of NF/Ukraine CAN was understood to have arrived in Ghent last week for Ger- man wholesaler Belor. The cargo was thought to have all
been sold last year. There are a still a few thousand tonnes
Belgiumof NF CAN stored in Ghent. Last offers were €210-212/t fca barge/truck.
CAN market still in limbo, DAP falls

OCI is planning to re-start its only CAN producing unit at Geleen in week six (week commencing 8 February). If the start-up of its three CAN lines goes smoothly, the producer expects to begin deliveries from the second-half of March. Offline since the fire on 30 September, over 500,000t of potential CAN production is estimated to have been lost.
UAN
Port inventories of UAN remain high as the Belgian market waits for the application season to begin in mid-February. Market prices for February/March delivery in Ghent are €8- 9/t lower at €156-157/t fca compared to end January at €164- 166/t fca Terneuzen/Ghent.
Forward offers via traders were extremely competitive this week at €143-145/t fca for June-October delivery. However, it was unclear whether there was much volume behind it or if traders were just testing the market.
EuroChem is planning a 35,000t cargo to load in Tuapse for Rouen/Ghent, indicating netbacks around $140/t fob from European markets at present.
Urea
Urea prices continue to collapse in the international market and as a result, offers into Benelux have fallen to €227-228/t fca ARA ports for February/March delivery. This is down by €10-12/t since last offers at the end of January. Urea is not widely used in Belgium but it is traded through its ports.
DAP
DAP prices have continued to fall losing about €15-20/t since end January. Offers were heard at €380-385/t fca or $420- 425/t fca Benelux ports this week. Buying interest, however, was extremely low as blenders are well-stocked for the time being. New buying is not expected until April/May for the corn application season.
TSP prices have in contrast remained stable because of less competition in the market. Offers remain at around €355/t fca Ghent for imported TSP and at €365/t ex-works Amster- dam.
MOP
Interest in re-stocking granular MOP has begun to surface slowly. Wet field conditions may see applications delayed and this could impact buying. Prices have softened slightly as competition for sales mounts. Spot prices are €275-277/t fca/fob warehouse in Ghent and Antwerp, which equates to €268-270/t cfr port. Sales of granular MOP are in the region
Issue 16-03 | Friday 5 February 2016
of €283-285/t cif inland depending on destination.
NPK
There is zero interest in complex fertilizers at present. How- ever, buyers are well aware of the latest falls in urea, DAP and potash and this is bound to pressure NPK prices lower once re-stocking begins. Last prices of imported 15-15-15 were at €325/t fca ex-store with local product offered at €335/t cif inland.
The Netherlands
Market awaits season start
The Dutch market continues to wait for the application season to start. Buyers remain
extremely cautious in the wake of the drop in both DAP and urea prices globally. Farmers are beginning to start to think about fertilizers and applications are expected to commence in about two weeks’ time. CAN producers are not thought likely to adjust prices lower until wholesalers and retailers have shifted higher-priced stock in March/April.
CAN
Everyone continues to wait in earnest for the application season to start in mid-February. Stocks are high at all points; producer, wholesale and retail. Buyers remain nervous of restocking as the market expects CAN prices to pull back in line with lower indications for urea on the global market. Producers, however, are unlikely to want to drop the CAN price until higher-priced inventories are sold on. Therefore CAN 27pc prices have remained at €226-230/t cif inland for the time being. But based on the current price of urea in Benelux ports at €225-230/t fca CAN looks severely out of line and over-priced. Producers are expected to adjust CAN prices lower when buyers step in to re-stock some time dur- ing March/April.
OCI’s 1.4mn t/year CAN unit at Geleen is still on track to begin restarting in week six (week commencing 8 February). All three lines have been halted since 30 September follow- ing a serious fire at the site. The restart is 4-5 weeks later than originally planned and the loss of production is estimat- ed at over 500,000t of CAN. OCI is planning for full running by the second half of March.

DAP/TSP
Offers of DAP have dropped dramatically again following falls in the international market. DAP offers in Benelux ports have fallen by a further $5-10/t to $420-425/t fca.
TSP prices have stayed steady this week at €355-360/t fca ex-warehouse Ghent. Amfert TSP remains on offer at €365/t ex-works Amsterdam.
MOP
MOP sales have remained at a standstill. There has been little frost to prompt new sales. Offers of granular MOP are €2/t softer at €275-277/t fca/fob warehouse, or at €283- 285/t cif inland depending on destination. When buyers come back into the market for re-fill volumes MOP prices are expected to be pressured down in line with falls in other commodities.
Ireland
Ground waterlogged, market inactive
The market is not yet moving – the ground is still too wet for application in most areas. De-
cember and January were very wet months, and the ground needs a week to ten days without rain to dry out. Farmer demand is expected to increase once the ground has dried out, perhaps by the latter half of February. For now, retail- ers estimate farmers to have taken about half the normal amount of fertilizers; demand may come in a rush once the ground dries out.
In some areas there is already good grass coverage, which has encouraged some farmers to set cattle to graze before first fertilizer application. This will push back some demand, in theory. But there is a concerted effort by retailers to explain that this may reduce grass growth potential later in the year, so this may be limited.
Wholesaler and retailer list prices are being maintained to date, with little business to test them. There is a general worry that CAN prices might be pressured lower once de- mand starts – but retailers and importers alike hope to shift existing stocks before this happens. Some estimates have enough CAN in country already to cover through to end- April/early-May. The feeling from other European markets is
Issue 16-03 | Friday 5 February 2016
that producers may adjust CAN prices lower during March- April.
Importers are largely covered for urea, having bought before Christmas. There is a freight inquiry for 2,550-2,750t of urea loading 5-12 February in Ust Luga for delivery to New Ross.
With stocks enough to cover most of the season the feeling is that Irish urea prices may be insulated from recent price drops in the international market.
Import activity is focussed on potash and phosphates, with a few cargoes booked for February arrival.
A 6,000t cargo of DAP will load from Tunisia next week for shipment to Ireland. It is understood to have been booked early January at about $450/t cfr. There was also a freight enquiry for 4,000t for shipment from Gabes-Cork loading 25- 30 January, likely for DAP.
Some small cargoes of MOP are also due to arrive, having been booked in early January when producer offers were about €280/t cif.

International Markets summary
Urea
Urea prices bottomed out this week after a three-month decrease that wiped $60/t off most fob levels. The US market is lending strength to urea. Cfr levels in the US Gulf have firmed to $220-223/t, equivalent to $210-213/t fob Middle East given current depressed freight rates. There are few cargoes being offered to Brazilian buyers at present, and prices of these have moved up to $200-205/t cfr. Chinese suppliers look unlikely to reduce prices ahead of the New Year break, with traders having difficulty covering below $200/t fob. Short covering in the Black Sea has seen prices pushed back up to $200-201/t fob Yuzhny from the low-$190s/t fob at the start of the week. Egypt was the only origin with lower prices this week, with sales made at $215-224/t fob for February.
Potash
India’s Department of Fertilizers has stopped the movement of imported MOP from ports and domestic stores, amid mounting stocks and low domestic demand. Officially there has been no progress with 2016 Chinese contract talks and now this market is heading into the New Year and Spring Festival holidays. NPK plants are already shut down and no activity is expected over the coming weeks. Some price stability emerged this week in Malaysia and Indonesia, however, aided by strengthening local currencies compared to the US dollar. In Brazil, firm demand is limited and price indications have edged down again. A trade has been reported this week at a price understood to be around $240/t cfr Brazil for 24,000t of granular MOP. This vessel will load between 5-10 February.
DAP/MAP
Prices remain under pressure in all regions. In response Mosaic has cut first quarter production by 400,000t DAP/ MAP, OCP is tailoring its output to match demand and Sabic is pushing 2H February shipments back to March. But Chinese producers look unlikely to cut back further, and OCP also this week inaugurated its new 1mn t/ year DAP/MAP/NPK plant at Jorf Lasfar. Latin American prices continued to fall as traders sell remaining lots from January vessels. In Argentina, MAP traded at $335/t cfr with $325/t cfr widely reported done in Brazil. GCT DAP has been sold in Turkey below $380/t fob (a drop of $40/t in a week). Indian demand is non-existent with the Department of Fertilizer stopping movement of DAP and NPKs from the ports inland. Southeast Asian cfr prices now

news REVIEW
Yara takes 4Q asset impairment charge
Norwegian fertilizer producer Yara will take an asset impair- ment charge of about 1.15bn kroner ($133mn) in its fourth- quarter 2015 results, which will be released on 11 February. Around NKr930mn of the total relates to the Yara production plants in Montoir, France, and in Trinidad and Tobago.
Yara Montoir will take an impairment charge of about NKr550mn. The plant is one of Yara's smallest fertilizer facilities, with production capacity of around 300,000 t/yr of nitrates and 300,000 t/yr of NPKs. The plant has limited export opportunities and is exposed to lower profitability in its domestic market, given lower grain prices and lower phosphate and potash demand.
The impairment charge for Yara Trinidad is about NKr380mn. The Trinidad and Tobago plant is one of Yara's smallest am- monia plants, with production capacity of around 270,000 t/ yr. The plant suffers from frequent gas supply curtailments and has lower energy efficiency than Yara's average levels.
Yara's fourth-quarter results will also be affected by lower sales and production compared with the year-earlier period, mainly for ammonia and urea following significant production shut- downs at plants producing those products during the quarter. Deliveries of Yara's produced ammonia and urea each fell by about 160,000t compared with the fourth quarter last year, while sales of the company's produced nitrates were down by around 100,000t over the same period. Yara's fourth-quarter compound NPK deliveries were in line with a year earlier.
Achema, Statoil conclude LNG negotiations
Lithuanian fertilizer producer Achema has successfully con- cluded negotiations with Norway's state-controlled Statoil for annual supply of LNG.
The two parties have reached a preliminary agreement and a formal contract will be signed in the next few weeks, Achema said.
Achema was previously negotiating with various gas suppli- ers, including Russian state-controlled Gazprom after the firms' gas supply contract ended. Gazprom was supplying gas at $7.05/mn Btu to Lithuania in November 2015.
"Our major concern is to ensure stable gas supply with the best conditions… so far fertilizers have been produced from Gazprom-supplied natural gas, but we managed to agree better
conditions with Statoil and a significantly lower price than Gaz- prom's," Achema's general director Ramunas Miliauskas said.
The price of LNG under the supply deal will be linked to the UK NBP hub price.
Uralchem 2015 fertilizer output rises
Russian fertilizer producer Uralchem's total commercial pro- duction in 2015 rose by 4pc to 5.9mn t from 5.6mn t in 2014.
The company's nitrogen output increased by 2pc from a year earlier to 4.9mn t. Within this segment, its ammonium nitrate output fell by 12pc to 2.9mn t, its urea output was up by 7pc to 1.2mn t and its merchant ammonia production jumped by 6pc to 825,000t.
On phosphates, namely MAP, output increased by 150pc to 104,000t, while production of complex fertilizers increased by 18pc from a year earlier to 617,000t.
Uralchem chief executive Dmitry Konyaev said: “In spite of the complex situation in both the industry and the economy in general, we closed the year with a good performance. Last year we adopted the updated development strategy for 2016-
20.It envisages not only development of current capacities and improvement of production energy efficiency, but also a serious investment programme of new construction. Last year, particular attention was paid to the domestic market.”
Acron forecasts 1Q16 market recovery
Russian fertilizer producer Acron posted a 1.5pc year-on- year fall in output to 5.02mn t in 2015, owing to equipment upgrade and maintenance at its production facilities. But the company sees potential for market recovery early this year.
"We expect the global mineral fertilizer market to recover in the first quarter as we approach the spring sowing season in the northern hemisphere, which will support prices in the nitrogen and phosphate sectors," Acron chairman Alexander Popov said.
Acron upgraded equipment at the Hongri Acron site to im- prove environmental sustainability, while a planned overhaul of its facilities at Veliky Novgorod took place in April-May and August-September.
Nitrogen production in 2015 was unchanged from last year at around 3mn t. Complex fertilizer output fell by just under 2pc to 2.49mn t from 2.53mn t, while NPK output of 2.43mn t was stable compared with a year earlier, falling by less than 1pc.

AGRICULTURE REVIEW
EU maize production to fall in 2015-16
The EU’s latest cereals forecast report estimates that maize production in 2015-16 will fall by 28pc to 56.2mn t, com- pared with 2014-15. This figure was projected at 56.6mn t in December.
Production of rye and oats is also expected to fall during the period — by 15pc and 7pc to 7.4mn t and 7.5mn t, respectively.
Overall cereal production is to fall by 7pc year on year to 307mn t in 2015-16.
The report reveals that production of soft wheat and maize was at a record level in 2014-15, at 149mn t and 78mn t, re- spectively. Wheat production is forecast at 150mn t in 2015-16.
The report also forecast that end stocks as at June 2016 would stand at around 43mn t for all cereals, down from the 46.1mn t carried forward from June 2015.
Mild weather delays crop hardening in Europe
Extremely mild weather in December has delayed the hard- ening of winter crops within Europe, the EU’s January MARS crop monitoring report says.
“Our latest frost-kill model simulations show no or only a slight degree of hardening in western and southern Europe,” the report says. Winter crops have not gained low-tempera- ture tolerance owing to unusually high temperatures in most of the British Isles, the Iberian peninsula and France, the
Mediterranean region, the Balkan peninsula and surrounding areas of the Black Sea.
These crops run the risk of incurring frost-kill damage in the event of a sudden freezing air intrusion, according to the EU’s Joint Research Commission.
The situation has improved slightly in central and southeast- ern Europe since mid-December, owing to the colder-than- usual weather conditions of late December-early January.
Syngenta favours ChemChina takeover bid
Switzerland-based agricultural company Syngenta is poised to accept a $43bn cash takeover offer from Chinese state- owned ChemChina.
Syngenta's board of directors unanimously recommended that shareholders accept the offer. It would be the larg- est Chinese purchase of a foreign company. The transac- tion is expected to conclude by the end of this year, if it is approved by regulators. European and US regulators are expected to examine the deal closely.
"The transaction minimises operational disruption, it is focused on growth globally, specifically in China and other emerging markets, and enables long-term investment in innovation. Syngenta will remain Syngenta," the firm's chair- man, Michel Demare, said.
Although agricultural commodity prices continue to fall, Chem- China's bid for Syngenta is geared towards improving China's do- mestic farming output to feed the country's 1.4bn population.
