Market summary
More upbeat market sentiment
Market sentiment is improving, at least from a suppliers’ perspective, and prices may start to firm in the coming weeks. The more positive tone was reflected in southeast Asia this week, where Mitsui has been awarded the Kaltim tender for 20,000t for end-June loading from Bontang at $437.50/t cfr.
A tighter market in the east is becoming evident, and in India, FACT this week announced that it had scrapped its tender for 7,500t for late-June delivery to Cochin, hav- ing only received one offer from Trammo at $515/t cfr. Prices into India are assessed in the $420-465/t cfr range, Trammo has this week said it has sold a cargo to SPIC at
$450/t cfr, suggesting a firmer trend in prices. Transagri this week reported that its ex-Iran cargo to IFFCO Kandla which discharged last week was priced at $402/t cfr, significantly below prices announced this week.
In Yuzhny prices are still assessed in the $380-390/t fob range, although one trader is reportedly looking to sell ton- nage at $400/t fob this week. Latest netbacks on sales into Turkey are estimated to netback to around $380-385/t fob, while spot business is closer to the $390/t level. Ameropa

has confirmed the sale of a 23,000t cargo to Muntajat on a cfr basis which will be delivered from Yuzhny to JPMC, Aqaba.
There is limited vessel availability East of Suez currently, so longer gaps between deliveries into East Asia are expected during July. Trammo has chartered the Berlian Ekuator until end-July and will load the vessel from Saudi Arabia early next week.
Koch has taken the Gas Grouper from Ameropa for around 60-days it is understood. The vessel loaded a cargo from Yu- zhny in late-May under a cfr sale from Ameropa to Koch for the US. The vessel is due in Beaumont around 15 June, and is expected to stay in the US/Caribbean until September.
Outlook: Stable/Firming.
middle of July. OPZ is currently negotiating gas supply prices for the second half of this year with Naftogaz.
There is around 300,000t lined-up to load out of Yuzhny this month so far.
Baltic
Koch completed loading of 15,000t of Togliatti ammonia purchased from Ameropa in Sillamae on the Clipper Neptun late last week , having loaded 20,000t of Uralchem ammonia from Ventspils earlier last week. The vessel is due to arrive in the US around 24 June.
Yara is due to load the Coral Ivory from Sillamae this week for delivery to its own system in Sweden.
France
Last week Trammo loaded around 10,000t on the Sylvie from Rouen, and the vessel will soon load the around 12,000t from Sorfert in Algeria for delivery to Turkey.
Europe
Yuzhny
There has been good demand out of Yuzhny for June tonnes, with Koch securing 40,000t for the US and Muntajat buying a 23,000t cargo from Ameropa to cover its delivery to JPMC, Jordan. Koch was due to load around 20-25,000t of Togliatti ammonia purchased from Ameropa on the Jenny N in the latter part of this month, with the balance 15,000t expected to come from OPZ, but it now appears that all 40,000t for the vessel will be purchased from Ameropa.
OPZ continues to run two ammonia and two urea lines, and the producer has agreed gas terms with Naftogaz until the

Ameropa’s Gas Cobia has discharged around 7,000t to Bagfas this week and the vessel is now on its way to Tunisia to dis- charge around 16,000t to GCT.

Saudi Arabia
Sabic this week reports an increase in spot enquiries from traders looking to supply the US and East Asia, following on from its sale last week of a 23,000t cargo to Mitsui for mid- July loading on the Gas Quantum.

availability in July. Trammo will load three cargos from Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks, and will use the Berlian Ekuator for one of these shipments. Trammo has chartered the vessel until end-July.
Line-up from Saudi Arabia 2H June
UAE
Trammo has confirmed that it has bought 12,000t from Fertil for 2H June loading from Ruwais. The cargo was priced at around the same level as Trammo’s purchase from Sabic in late-May, which was agreed at $404/t fob.
Algeria
Trammo will load around 10-12,000t on the Sylvie from Sorfert in the coming days. The urea line at Sorfert was restarted this week, and the producer reports that both am- monia units are now running well.
Yara is scheduled to load the Navigator Gusto again later in June from Sorfert, having already loaded a cargo from the plant this month, and OFT is scheduled to load two cargoes from Sorfert this month on the Navigator Galaxy.
Tunisia
GCT will receive around 16,000t from Ameropa later this month on the Gas Cobia. The delivery is expected to coincide with the restart of GCT’s DAP production.

Indian subcontinent
India
Demand from Indian buyers is picking up. Trammo says it has sold a cargo to SPIC, Tuticorin, at $450/t cfr this week – the price could not be confirmed with SPIC by press time.
Transagri this week reported that its 5,500t cargo to IF- FCO, Kandla, which was discharged on 5 June was priced at $402/t cfr. The cargo was sourced from Iran and delivered on Ever Rich 1.
FACT this week announced that it has scrapped the 5 June tender for 7,500t for 26-30 June delivery. The tender only received one offer which was $515/t cfr from Trammo.

Indonesia
Mitsui has won the Kaltim tender for 20,000t for end-June loading from Bontang. It is understood that the tender re- ceived the following offers:
•Mitsui at $437.50/t fob
•Trammo at $420/t fob
•Fertcomm at around $380/t fob
The award price is similar to Yara’s sale into Indonesia, which was settled in late-May, for a 6,000t delivery to CJ for end-June delivery at $437/t cfr.
The KPI plant is expected to be taken down for mainte- nance in mid-June for 3-4 weeks. Last week Argus FMB reported that the KPA plant will be taken down in the new few months for maintenance, but it is understood that no maintenance work is scheduled for the time-being, although export volumes from this plant do appear to have reduced.
China
A firmer domestic urea and MAP market has put some up- ward pressure on ammonia prices. Prices in Hebei province are around RMB2,500/t ex-works this week compared to RMB2,250/t earlier this month. The mainstream price in Shandong province is also up by around RMB30/t ex-works to RMB2,500/t ex-works.
Taiwan
TFC will receive its next ammonia cargo from Sabic on the al-Barrah in the coming days as reported last week. The pro- ducer’s next ammonia shipment will then be in 2H July. TFC has been running its Amsul plant at around 50% of capacity currently due to lower domestic demand but plans to ramp up production rates in late-July to prepare for the autumn fertilizer season.
South Korea
SFC will receive its next ammonia shipment on the Bunga Kemboja ex-Kertih in the middle of this month .
Trammo is due to deliver a cargo into South Korea on the Sanko Innovator ex-Bontang later this month. The vessel will also discharge a cargo in Caojing, China.
Australia
There are reports that the Pilbara plant in Australia has had some production problems this week.
Americas
US
The US ammonia market continued its seasonal decline this week. Corn in many regions is reaching heights that prevent further sidedress. Inventory is low heading into summer, so price declines have been measured. There were, however, some reports of more aggressive offers this week, although there were likely limited volumes concluded at these price levels.
The most notable declines were at Oklahoma production points. One producer dropped offers to as low as $470/ st fot, down from about $525/st fot just last week. Other production sites held offers closer to $500/st fot. Although offers were significantly lower than last week, consensus among traders is that limited tons were sold at these values.
The range of offers in the west Corn Belt has moved lower and widened. Asking prices are still as high as $595/st fot in northeast Iowa, but have fallen to as low as $520/st near the Iowa-Nebraska border. Further sidedress consumption in that area is expected to be limited with most of these applica- tions done with UAN.
Higher numbers in the east Corn Belt have now receded with offers now in the range of $600-620/st. Offers are higher moving east with only limited business done at $620/st fot in Indiana.
Some of the crop, particularly in the east Corn Belt, has only now reached the emergence stage, which should bode well for a long tail to consumption into summer. At least one supplier has recently moved new tons to East Corn Belt terminals via barge.
