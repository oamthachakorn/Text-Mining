Brazil leads world MAP values lower; DAP down in EU; Mosaic cuts output; NOLA range stretched wider still
World phosphates markets are down again, as Brazil MAP leads the market lower to
$325pt cfr for open-origin 11-52. This comes in step with ongoing demand deferral, flat crop prices, and helped along by some trader formula fob-pricing interests. The bearish MAP sentiment has spread to markets for DAP in Europe, Pakistan and SE Asia, though each of these have prices in different tiers: Malaysia at $380pt cfr, Pakistan at $393pt cfr and EU import equivalent at $415pt cfr. China domestic markets saw some marginal erosion headed into the Spring Festival break. NOLA was again down and up in a $23pst range within a week. This came after a significant - but probably not game- changing - news of Mosaic output cuts. We had already noted this as likely due to a dip in Tampa NH3 arrivals. Since the US cutback, no other producers have followed with output changes. So supply stays firm, just like most integrated industry cash margins.
One-minute briefing
∙Brazil MAP slides, losing $10pt more to $325 cfr, again influencing formula fobs
∙Mosaic cuts US phosphates production 400,000t in Q1, above our expectation
∙NOLA DAP up on the Mosaic news; All-week sales in wide range $312-335pst fob
∙No fresh fob export business from Tampa; Market awaits final lot to Australia
∙Several producers again criticize impact of formula business, but take no action
∙Phosagro statement foresees further 10% MAP price cut to $320s pt fob Baltic
∙The 2 points above hint the lowest-cost producers are curious to stress-test others
∙China domestic markets remain slow as market heads into Spring Festival break
∙Europe DAP prices slide, but remain some $90 pt above world MAP low (Brazil)
∙Crop futures, meantime, continue to make small, steady gains (chart below)

Analysis
Industry end-February position – our take: Our first call on the global DAP, MAP, NPs industry position for end February shows a substantial surplus of about +493,000t of all grades. The biggest length is at the export point that prefers to defer export decisions each month to the last moment – namely Morocco, with an apparent build of 142kt DAP/MAP and compounds combined. As noted last week, February stock increases look inevitable as long as key markets start to see value in current prices, or unless producers make real changes to production. So far real cutbacks are confirmed only at YTH in China and Mosaic in the US. Both of these markets are among those in which seasonal demand could change the game in the short-term. This is however, yet to materialise.
Crop prices. Corn futures ended marginally softer on the day today, but were a few ticks up on the week, with the CME March contract at $3.69/bu by presstime. Along the forward curve, December 2016 and July 2017 corn also closed down on the day, but were up on the week to $3.92/bu and $4.09/bu respectively. Soybeans ended up on the week at $8.76/bu.

US domestic: DAP barges have traded once again in a very wide range as indexing interests rage on all sides. From the importers point of view, the low numbers influence the fob price of incoming cargoes. From local producers’ standpoint, index numbers can influence inland warehouse numbers.
∙So while uncertainty prevails over grower and retailer moves on phosphates buying, the index itself continues to drive market prices more than the underlying S&D.;
∙Prices for physical DAP have ranged this week from a low at $312pst fob for Russian and Moroccan material, up to $335pst fob on one fresh barge sold by Mosaic to a distributor in a southern US market. There were other trades on good volumes this week in between at $320, $323, $326pst fob. Some distributors had noted again seeing Mosaic buy-back bids midweek on the producer’s own material in the low/mid $320s pst fob. These were rejected as selling interest on US-origin DAP became more cautious. Mosaic has fresh – so far unsuccessful - offers out today at $340pst fob.
US production: Mosaic has just announced a Q1 cutback of around 400,000t metric DAP/MAP/MES. This is bigger than our estimate noted in last week’s report (item below). We think this is partly bringing forward maintenance, and partly in connection with a major DAP/MAP conversion to MES.
∙Mosaic market take: Mosaic explained the cutback move saying it believes current market prices do not reflect the value it sees for its products. The company also said it is not participating nor selling at the low price level seen in Brazil today nor at NOLA in the last few weeks.
∙So far no other producers have followed the US and China with cutback initiatives. For now exports from Russia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia are still supporting trader formula priced deals on MAP into Brazil and the US, and therefore are exposed to lower-priced short-selling.
From our last Weekly Report: With only 4 cargoes of ammonia into Tampa in January….our speculation is for an overall Mosaic cutback of around
100-110,000tpm. The output call is complicated as Florida downtime was already likely due known major conversion work to complete at two New Wales trains from DAP/MAP to full flexibility with various MES grades.
∙Detail: Also as noted in our report last week: The output call is complicated as Florida downtime was already likely due the known major conversion work to complete at two New Wales trains from DAP/MAP to full flexibility with various MES grades.
∙Timing: The Mosaic announcement comes a few days ahead of the annual US domestic TFI meeting (in Orlando). It is known that several local traders short-sold against Mosaic last month in the period when Mosaic made some attempts to buy back its own material. We had expected Mosaic would provide guidance on Q1 production plans at an investor presentation for its Q4 and full 2015 results, however the news has come earlier.
US DAP, MAP Balance
**Mosaic, DAP, MAP& MES rates at all 4 Florida plants and in Louisiana, taking shutdowns in Q1 – 400kt “lost” output means committed at least to end Feb
*Mosaic contracts & off-shore system incl.: Brazil, Colombia & Mexico.
Mexico balance DAP, MAP
Fertinal has end Feb carry, but this could go to Australia
US export: Since Mosaic’s cutback news there are no fresh US export offers of DAP, MAP or MES into any market worldwide. The next executions from Tampa are reckoned to be to a trader for Australia (indexed to several fob quotes, likely including Tampa and China), some Mosaic system business to Brazil and contract volumes to Colombia.
Cross-gulf Tampa to NOLA: There were no cross-gulf vessel moves in January, Most Mosaic NOLA business from strong cross-gulf volumes in Q4
US import: Three MAP/DAP import cargoes are poised to land in the US from all sources over the next 4 weeks from early February to early March. There are two from Morocco (90,000t DAP/MAP in two lots via 2 traders) and a Eurochem Russian DAP/MAP panamax to the US East Coast & NOLA combined.
Latin America
Brazil: New business for a minor 5,000t part-lot of open-origin MAP is confirmed in Brazil at $325pt cfr. This is via a trader to Fertipar. It is understood Fertipar has purchased several minor part-lots in recent weeks totalling around 20,000t MAP in a range $325-340pt cfr.
∙Other importers are testing traders, but are asking for credit terms that producers are unwilling to cover in direct business.
∙This gives traders with available credit lines into Brazil good leverage with producers to cover short sales on formula pricing.
∙From a producer stand-point, these formula sales are the lesser of various negative outcomes which include building exposure to Brazilian distributor solvency, or reducing production. So while demand is soft in the usual price drivers at this time of year (China domestic, US & Canada
Russia DAP, MAP balance
Phosagro and Eurochem running at regular rates. Uralchem ops on one line at Voskressensk
Lithuania balance DAP
Part of shipments to NW Europe are still seen in ARA area port stock
domestic & inland Europe), it is simpler for producers to continue to give up Brazil cfr pricing initiative to traders.
∙Brazil SSP: There are reports of price declines in the local market in key internal markets – with SSP 19-21% is variously said averaging $220- 230pt fot storage to blenders ex Rondonopolis.
Argentina, Uruguay: A Nitron sale of DAP to a group of minor Argentine buyers is heard shipping ex Murmansk to Necochea. This is a separate cargo to the lot Phosagro sold about a month ago (for January shipping) directly to Argentina buyers. Last done for DAP and MAP is confirmed at $350-353 pt cfr 3-4 discharge ports, offers now falling into the $340s pt cfr.
Mexico production, Fertinal nationalisation: A statement was made late last week by Fertinal late last week concerning its purchase by Pemex, and integration in Pemex Fertilizantes. This operation will “integrate the natural gas-ammonia-fertilizers value chain” according to Fertinal The key points in terms of a change with Fertinal positioning today appear to be:
∙Vertical integration with raw materials (the implication is cheaper, captive ammonia), though the Pemex NH3 balance is not always thought to be in surplus; and greater supply to the Mexican domestic market. The two stand-out implications here are perhaps fewer Fertinal export avails, but with this perhaps some displacement of imports via the East Coast ports from Tampa.
∙Today, some small farmers in Mexico have a limited access to the fertilizer supply. In order to tackle this shortage, the acquisition will help to rebuild the domestic market and the supply into less developed sectors, mainly the ones in the South & SE areas of Mexico, offering a product based on international standards and competitive prices.
∙The new Grupo Fertinal will continue to work in its current markets and will continue to build long term, as well as strong business relationships with current clients, contractors and suppliers which have shown their preference for the well-known worldwide quality and service that are characteristic of Grupo Fertinal.
∙During this transition, Fertinal’s top management will remain in their positions. The best professional experience from Pemex will join in this new venture aiming to maintain the quality of its products, to further increase its capacity and efficiency, and implement best practices.
Europe, Africa
West Europe: DAP is heard down a further €5pt to €390pt fca ex store at most NW Europe ports. This is equivalent to the low/mid $410s pt cfr duty paid/free. Helm is now expected to move the balance of its Mexican cargo just discharged in Atlantic France to Germany.
∙Mexico import cargo: Helm’s import cargo of Mexican DAP has arrived in France, locals curious to see the beige colour product meeting local spec conditions and appearance preferences.
Morocco DAP, MAP, NP/Ks
*Allowing for 85,000tpm P2O5 combined phosacid to India, Pakistan (but less than usual during Fauji turnaround), Europe and Saudi, Feb granulation seen about 420,000t DAP, MAP, NPs & NPKs. OCP carry-over is significant, suggesting it needs fresh February business in Europe, or more to the US. Output cuts unlikely.
Tunisia balance
GCT is heard continuing on acid and DAP on one line at Gabes. It will carry end Feb tonnage to March, unless it competes more strongly into Europe
Turkey: GCT is linked with two direct sales for a total 15,000t DAP into North and Med Turkey for 2H February shipment in the mid $380s pt cfr with credit, or around $380pt cfr cash. Bagfas’ 50,000t export commitment to Ethiopia for NP19-38 S & Z seems to be opening a minor, prompt import opportunity for DAP into Turkey.
∙January import DAP from Morocco: There are strong reports from Turkey of a Moroccan export sale of 22,000t DAP into South Turkey. Though emerging now, it is though done in early Jan near $405pt cfr.
Tunisia: The latest business to Turkey (above) reflects near $370pt fob Gabes. While this is well below EU netbacks (indicative at around $405-408pt fob basis the latest NW European warehouse re-sales in the mid/high €390spt fca French Atlantic), it is far above indicative North African DAP/MAP yields from competitive spot action today on MAP into Brazil or DAP at NOLA.
∙Production & local demand: GCT is heard running at low levels on DAP at Gabes, around 35-40,000tpm. Of this, around +/-10,000tpm is heard ear-marked for local market distribution, as seasonal needs approach.
Morocco: OCP shipped around 90,000t of NP S B on two lots to Ethiopia as planned by the end of January. A further 90-100,000t of this grade is expected to complete now to early March.
∙For the US, there are reports of two separate DAP/MAP export cargoes in early February for a total 85,000t into NOLA by late February. One is heard via Koch and another through Gavilon.
∙We see Moroccan February dispatches moderating to around 330,000t, including a sizeable volume of 80,000t of all grades to the domestic market. This is still assuming two more NPS shipments will be completed over the next 30 days for Ethiopia.
∙To Turkey: The 22,000t DAP lot to Med Turkey noted above and heard shipped in late January reflects around $395pt fob Morocco, significantly lower than prices on DAP to West Europe. The move essentially re- captures market share in Turkey after Bagfas took the NP S & Z business in Ethiopia with Turkish export product.
∙New offers to Europe: OCP is not yet offering into Europe for next-round shipments to Europe in end February / early March. There is substantial sensitivity among buyers sitting on much higher-priced January loads. As a result, talks on new pricing – effectively for March shipment – have been postponed a few weeks. As per our earlier reports, OCP has a baseload with NPS and MAP/DAP exports to Ethiopia and the US in the near-term, but will have a stock-build up to address by end February unless a compromise is reached into Europe.
∙Theoretical netbacks on the European port warehouse business note above (though not yet on offer from OCP) are in the low $390spt fob North Africa. This is still a 3-digit cash margin on Moroccan DAP, though is slimmer for Tunisian. Both OCP and GCT are waiting to see if moderate EU DAP pipeline avails will trigger an 11th hour demand rebound over the next 4-6 weeks.
Australia balance DAP, MAP
Jordan balance DAP
So far in 2015-16, JPMC is thought to have shipped about 170,000t DAP to India, from a base-load MoU of 300,000t. This maximum volume rarely ships Jordan to India in any fertilizer year. Minor truck movements to Iraq continue. JPMC running lower rates, so stock accumulation is moderate
∙Eurochem meantime looks more active in Southeast Europe, in markets such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine out of Belorechensk. This may also reflect the December stoppage at
Phosagro’s southern Russian Balakovo plant due the sulphur contract dispute at that time. This unit, however, is believed to have been busy with Russian domestic market demand in any case.
Russia: Phosagro management has forecast a near- term price bottom-out will emerge on export MAP after a further 10% price slide to levels around $320pt fob Baltic. Taking a 10% dip from our current low-end assessment today near $340pt fob, export values could slip to $305-306pt fob. Netbacks from the latest spot action in Brazil are already around this level. There have, however, been several clear statements in earlier weeks from Phosagro that it will not support formula-priced fob calculations derived from published MAP prices basis cfr Brazil.
∙Europe netbacks: The netback on the European business above is now around $360pt fob Baltic (net freight and EU import duty). This is still approaching a $200pt cash margin for Phosagro, currently at the bottom of the global cost curve.
∙Russia NPKs: The Phosagro panamax of 10-26- 26 to Deepak for early February shipment to India is reckoned to have a netback value in the $330s pt fob Baltic. This is about on a par with levels reckoned achievable for 9-25-25 in the EU, though Europe is now slow.
Middle East
Saudi Arabia: Sabic, now responsible for 30% of MPC jv exports, is not offering fresh export avails. Ma’aden has 3 further MAP cargoes for a total 120,000t MAP for February/March shipment to Latin America. Two are for Brazil heard to be for Yara (sold directly by Ma’aden via Comexport under formula), and another cargo for Argentina and Uruguay/Paraguay distribution via Nitron.
∙For DAP, since the Indian MoA moratorium on inland DAP movement within India, there are now unlikely to be any February loads from Ma’aden or
Sabic to any MoU buyers.
∙The Ma’aden February production plan is still thought to be for 100,000t each of DAP and MAP.
South Asia
Pakistan: Quantum is linked with a fresh 27,000t DAP sale from Australia to Pakistan. Local rumours point to business with UAC at a price in the low/mid $390s pt cfr. This is in line with the last Chinese DAP sold to India in the mid $380s pt cfr, and sharper than Saudi indications. The cargo is heard to be shipping this week ex Townsville on the MV Bright Hope.
∙From China a trader is now heard working a 25,000t DAP cargo to Karachi for end-February loading, said offered in the high $380s pt cfr.
∙Pakistan S&D; balanced, but importers see
“average-down” value: While Pakistan is reckoned to have enough DAP for the current Rabi season, some importers see value in new business to average down Q4 arrival business in the $450s pt cfr. It remains to be seen if enquiries from other importers emerge to test Chinese fob levels currently in the $370s pt fob.
India: An MoA internal movement ban on DAP from ports to inland markets is heard imposed with immediate effect. This is a common step ahead of the budget anticipated each year in end-February.
∙The move prevents fresh imports booked at the higher subsidy for the 2015-16 fertilizer year, but are sold into next campaign. If subsidy is going to be cut (as is widely expected), there can be opportunistic moves to book product into the distribution chain at today’s subsidy. No fresh imports are therefore likely on DAP from any source. This mirrors the supplier posture into last week’s MMTC tender, into which no offers were made.
∙NPKs exempt? The move so far apparently only affects DAP, not NPKs. One big cargo of Russian NPKs is still due into in India in 1H March.
India domestic: A Punjab Marketing Federation tender for 80,000t DAP into local storage in calendar Q2 (next fertilizer year) is heard to have found offers either side of Rs21,400pt del. This is the first clue on scope for a retail price ceiling (MRP) cut next year, down from Rs23,700pt in the 2015-16 campaign. A cut in retail ceiling of Rs1,750pt (allowing some dealer margin) is today equivalent to $25pt. There is still some time until the specifics of next year’s retail
India cont’d: prices and P, K fertilizer subsidies will be posted, even if a global, all-fertilizer subsidy figure is set in the Indian budget in late February.
Bangladesh the first Ma’aden MoU contract DAP lot to BADC is expected to be for March loading ex RAK.
East Asia, Pacific
China domestic: Headed into the Spring Festival, DAP prices have stabilised after the recent producer cuts in search of liquidity. Trade is thin, however, and most distributors in north and northeast markets look set to wait out the holiday time and the current winter conditions.
∙DAP prices are now broadly at RMB2.650 pt fot ex inland warehouses (low $400s), reflecting the mid/high $350spt fot ex works. Local MAP 11-44 is also flat in the local market at RMB1,930spt fot ex works ($280s) in similarly slow trade, with numerous NPK plant slowdowns and shutdowns for the holiday period.
MKP 0-52-34; UP = Urea Phosphate * Low-end Chinese origin EU duty paid 6.5%
Malaysia: Nafas is heard to have taken a minor lot of Chinese DAP (17/17.5-46) at $380pt cfr.
China export: The business above for DAP (17/17.5- 46) to Malaysia looks to be a netback in the mid $360s pt fob China. DAP grading guaranteed 18-46 is offered tentatively at $370-380pt fob export duty paid, according to lot size and destination, lately including India again and Pakistan (both successfully). Granular MAP 11-44 is heard indicated in the low $300s pt fob, also export duty paid.
Australia: As IPL/Quantum responds to isolated DAP export opportunities (recent sales to Thailand & Pakistan), import competition for MAP remains strong. This is likely assisted by the slide in MAP values to alternative markets in the western hemisphere, for example Brazil now in the $330s pt cfr.
∙Next imports: Mosaic is expected to load a panamax DAP/MAP for a trader to Australia in early February, following two other US export combo lots already on the water. Ameropa is in the freight market for a fresh Mexican export lot of 40,000t MAP ex Fertinal for 2H February loading to multiple East and South Australia ports. If settled, this will be among the first exports under Pemex ownership.
