OCP aims for energy independence by 2020
Moroccan phosphates giant OCP plans to boost investments in renewable energy as it looks to achieve energy independence by 2020, according to news agency SeeNews.
The company is targeting a generation capacity of 600 megawatts by 2020 by investments in wind, solar and hydro energy along with cogeneration, the Moroccan Energy Minister Abdelkader Amara said at a mining conference last week.
Since 2010, OCP has raised co-generation capacity to 350 megawatts, which covered 60% of their electricity needs in 2015.
The news comes as King Mohammed VI inaugurated the company's JPH-1 fertilizer production hub, which is dedicated to African markets. Production at the site started at the end of 2015.
The plant is part of OCP's ambitious strategy to increase fertilizer production to 12 million mt by 2017 with a second hub set to come online by the end of Q2 2016.
ENVIRONMENT
K+S cuts saline waste production by 50%
K+S cut its saline waste water production by 50% at the end of 2015, in line with the timing of its original goal to do so, according to a company press statement.
The potash producer said that it invested about €400 million ($437.2 million) in new facilities in order to reduce the amount of saline waste that it was creating in Germany to 7 million cubic metres.
“Water protection is an integral part of our sustainable potash production and an important condition for the preservation of almost 4,500 jobs in the Werra-Fulda potash district,” K+S Managing Director Dr Rainer Gerling said.
Further measures are expected through to 2017 via the Hessen state government’s four-phase disposal plan, which will further reduce waste water production by 1.5 million cubic metres per year.
In December, K+S was given the permission to continue with limited injections of waste at one of its potash plants into the Werra river until December 21 by the Kassel Regional Council. This was even though
the authority is not expected to complete its technical assessment of the company’s waste disposal until the summer of 2016.
FREIGHT/SHIPPING
Freight markets tumble on abundance of vessels
The Baltic Exchange Dry Index has now sunk below 300 points for the first time on record, having begun 2016 at 473 points.
In the geared vessel sector, Supramax average earnings sunk to $2,837/day and the Handysize average to $2,909/day, both standing at their lowest levels since the Baltic Exchange assessments began (in 2005 and 2006 respectively). More significantly many are failing to cover their operating costs, much of this is a result of the oversupply of vessels.
Combined Brazilian exports of corn and soya (bean+meal) in January, at 6 million mt, were the lowest since February 2015 and down by 2 million mt from December 2015, according to Trade Ministry statistics.
The Latin American grain export season has been boosted by export initiatives by the new government in Argentina which has contributed to a contango in FFA prices. At close of business on February 3, Q2, 2016 futures contracts for Supramax and Handysize vessels were trading at premiums of approximately $1,700/day and $1,000/day to their prevailing spot earnings.
The sharpness of the contango in freight pricing has been offset by continued growth in fleet supply. January saw a dramatic jump in dry bulk newbuild deliveries, with preliminary figures from SSY, 58 geared vessels of
2.85Mdwt have entered service since the beginning of 2016, the highest since January 2015. The heaviest newbuild deliveries (26 ships of 1.62 Mdwt) in January have continued to be seen for Ultramax (60,000- 64,999 dwt) design.
LEGISLATION
Brazil receives early farm credit boost
The Brazilian government, in conjunction with Banco do Brasil (Bank of Brazil), have announced that BRL 10 billion ($2.51 billion) in credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, according to consultancy 'The Soybean and Corn Advisor'.
This early announcement of credit follows complaints in 2015, when credit was not available until May/June, significantly cutting farm budgets and fertilizer demand.
Small to medium sized farmers can receive loans for input purchasing through the National Programme to Help Medium-Sized Rural Producers (PRONAMP). Loans for BRL 710,000 ($180,000) have an interest rate of 7.75% and loans of BRL 1,200,000 ($304,350) see a rate of 8.75%. These rates are unchanged from 2015 and are significantly below free market interest rates, which are thought to be over 20%.
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
CF/CHS supply deal getting under way
CF Industries and CHS Inc. commenced their previously announced nitrogen fertilizer strategic venture February 1.
CHS completed its $2.8 billion equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen LLC, a CF Industries subsidiary, and will begin receiving delivery of urea and UAN from CF Industries under a long-term supply agreement.
CHS’ investment entitles it to purchase up to 1.1 million st granular urea and 580,000 st UAN annually from CF Nitrogen. The 1.7 million st of product available under the supply agreement represents approximately 8.9% of CF’s total production capacity once its expansion projects are completed at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa in 2016.
CHS also will be entitled to semi-annual profit distributions from CF Nitrogen based generally on the volume of granular urea and UAN purchased by CHS pursuant to the supply agreement.
PRODUCTION
PhosAgro fertilizer production increases 10%
Russian producer PhosAgro increased its total fertilizer production by 10.4% to 6.8 million mt in 2015, the company reports.
Despite a fall in commodity prices during 2015, phosphate-based fertilizer and MCP feed phosphates production rose by 12% during the period to 5.4 million mt.
PhosAgro's DAP/MAP production rose 12% to 2.6 million mt while NPK production increased 11% to 1.9 million mt. NPS production rose 10% to 272,800 mt.
Separately, phosphate rock production rose 4.7% to 7.9 million mt while phosphoric acid production as a feedstock increased 9.3% to 2.1 million mt.
Regarding nitrogen output, AN production rose 56% to 455,300 mt and urea production rose 1.3% to 978,000 mt. Ammonia production for feedstock use declined 5.8% to 1.1 million mt.
Overall sales volumes for phosphate-based fertilizers and MCP rose by 12% to 5.3 million mt but sales volumes of nitrogen-based fertilizers fell 1.4% to 1.4 million mt.
Despite some issues with demand at the start of 2015 in the Russian domestic market, PhosAgro still managed to have flat sales volumes to the domestic market during the year at 1.6 million mt of fertilizer. The company is optimistic that government support for agricultural production in Russia could boost sales in 2016.
Regarding exports, the company increased its overall fertilizer sales to Europe by over 30% to 1.3 million mt and hopes to achieve further sales in 2016. Sales to India increased dramatically, partly as a result of PhosAgro's new contract to IPL for NPK and DAP.
However, sales to the Latin American markets reduced due to low soybean prices and economic challenges facing the region.
Egypt: Misr Phosphate expands mining with three sites
Misr Phosphate is now operating three phosphate rock mines in Egypt, and recently began work at a new site.
Alongside production estimated at about 2 million mt/year for Abu-Tartour, the government-owned entity began operations at El Sibiya site close to the Red Sea two months ago, with its first shipment due to load out of Safaga.
El Sibiya produces 27-30% P2O5 rock, as well as 24-25% P2O5, Misr Phosphate said in Cairo.
The company also resumed operations at the Red Sea Mine, which produces higher-grade 30-32% P2O5 ore. There are said to be 500 workers on site and production estimates vary from 15,000 mt a month currently to about 40,000 mt.
Misr Phosphate receives only a small percentage of revenue for managing operations at the Red Sea mine but hopes to be awarded outright control in the near future.
Combined production from the three mines is estimated by the company to reach about 3 million mt/year.
Misr Phosphate and El Nasr Mining are still considering price-coordination to establish a single FOB price for each grade of rock exported from Egypt. The idea is understood to be encountering resistance from traders.
Uralchem boosts fertilizer output in 2015
Uralchem maintained steady production of ammonium nitrate (AN) in 2015 at 2.92 million mt while boosting output of merchant ammonia by 6% to 825,000 mt.
Urea production reached 1.18 million mt last year, up 7% on 2014.
Uralchem also produced 617,000 mt complex fertilizers, exceeding the 2014 figure by 18%.
Production increases were attributed to higher daily output across all plants and a “significant reduction in unscheduled downtime hours”.
Uralchem’s average daily ammonia output increased 1.5% while unscheduled downtime hours were reduced by 40.3%.
“In spite of the complex situation in both the industry and the economy in general, we closed the year with a good performance,” said Dmitry Konyaev, Uralchem CEO.
“Last year we adopted the updated development strategy for 2016-2020. It envisages not only development of current capacities and improvement of production energy efficiency, but also a serious investment programme of new construction,” Konyaev said.
CRU reported late last year that Uralchem had completed a 550 million rouble investment project at its Kirovo-Chepetsk ammonia facility. Capacity improvement work was undertaken during a maintenance shutdown in October-November this year. Ammonia production capacity was increased 3% to 1,750 mt/day.
Ammonia leak reported at Yara's Pilbara facility
An ammonia leak that prompted eight contractors to be taken to hospital is currently being investigated at Yara’s Pilbara, Australia facility.
The leak happened February 2.
In a written statement to ABC Australia, Yara Pilbara defended its response to the leak and said emergency crews responded quickly to contain the leak and help affected workers.
The company said it will work with authorities to ensure a thorough investigation.
At the time of writing ammonia production at the 850,000 mt/year capacity plant was at normal rates following the leak.
The plant restarted full ammonia production January 9-10 this year following a rupture in the plant’s sea water cooling system October 11, 2015 and subsequent technical issues.
PROJECTS
Egypt: Plans advance for phosphate complexes
Egypt is advancing plans to develop its phosphates sector with two major new complexes, the first of which is scheduled to begin construction this month.
Both projects are driven by a government shift away from exporting raw materials and a new focus on the increased value of downstream products.
The El Wady complex, the least advanced of the two projects, is due to be incorporated in the coming weeks after completing its pre-feasibility study last year. The joint venture between Misr Phosphate and Abu Qir and will be constructed in two phases, with the first to focus on the production of phosphoric acid.
About 3.1 million mt of rock is required and "secured at preferential prices," according to the prospectus. The project "will be heavily supported by the Egyptian government".
Production of 518,000 mt/year phosphoric acid (MGA) is planned for Phase 1, all for export. Part of the phosacid production will be used in Phase 2 to produce 345,000 mt/year DAP/MAP, with the rest (about 207,000 mt P2O5 exported). Phase 3 is production of about 345,000 mt/year TSP.
The investment cost is estimated at $1.05 billion and strategic investors are now being sought, with the project's sponsors aiming to retain a 40% stake.
In November President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi approved the construction of El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals' phosphate and compound fertilizers complex at Ain Sokhna.
It will produce DAP, MAP, TSP, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid, with the fertilizers destined for the domestic market with surplus production available for export. Construction will be compressed into 30 months, El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals said in Cairo this week.
