ANALYSIS
Asian prices climb further as Indian demand persists with tight availability
Asian spot prices for export were again assessed higher this week, as business was reported as high as
$30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, with suggestions that some deals may have even been done slightly higher than that.
The price hikes have been driven by tight regional availability combined with firm Indian spot demand.
Indian buyers have continued to seek spot imports of sulphuric acid, with recent prices pegged as high as the $70s/mt CFR. India’s Q1 imports were up 22.6% at 282,717 mt, following a 77.6% year-on-year increase in March volumes.
But although Asian spot prices have increased recently, they are still not high enough to attract export sales interest from Two Lions, which is focused on the more attractive domestic market where prices have also been rising as a result of maintenance turnarounds.
The Chilean market remains quiet with a lack of spot activity. Most sources pegged prices at $80-85/mt CFR, saying that some interest was starting to surface, but others said that anything above $80/mt CFR would be difficult to achieve. Chile’s April imports dropped 26% on the year, leaving total imports to date down slightly.
European spot prices were stable, with little new business this week and disputes on true notional levels. The most recent traded levels are in line with prices of the past several months, although reports that last week’s sales to Argentina went in the mid-$80s/mt CFR out of Antwerp suggested that the tendency may be downwards rather than upwards.
Morocco is still absent from the spot market, though a buyer source suggested that offer levels from Europe were declining. Trade data showed that the country’s Q1 imports were up by nearly a third, though it is still unlikely that its total 2015 imports will reach the level of the previous year.
Meanwhile, Fertilizer Week's short term forecast for June displayed little change from the previous month's iteration, with global prices not expected to change much throughout the forecast period, though there is greater uncertainty over the later months in the forecast.
Highlights of the week:
∙Asian FOB spot prices rise further
∙Indian spot demand persists into $70s/mt CFR
∙Indian Q1 imports climb after strong March
∙Two Lions focused on domestic market
∙Chilean spot market quiet with prices pegged around $80/mt CFR
∙Chile's April imports plunge
∙Morocco sticks to term contracts but reports lower offers
∙Fertilizer Week publishes latest short term forecast
Base Metals
Base metals prices reached their lowest levels since mid-April, or in the case of copper since March, before recovering slightly later in the week but remaining below last week's levels. Reported macroeconomic indicators were relatively weak, and concerns are still evident over both Chinese weakness and a possible Greek exit from the eurozone. LME copper was down to $5,991.50/mt for cash.
DAP & Sulphur
There is more smoke than fire in US phosphate and even global phosphate trade this week. Mosaic has taken a more aggressive stance on US domestic DAP pricing this week. This supports expectations that the US phosphate giant intends to continue running as close to capacity as it can over the summer.
Further signs of slightly higher prices were evident in sulphur markets this week, as Adnoc increased its OSP by $5/mt to $145/mt FOB for June and recent Middle East sales were heard in the high $140s/mt FOB. In addition, domestic Chinese prices climbed on relatively tight availability. However, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphates demand and its likely effect on Chinese phosphates exports, and Indian sulphur buyers also suggested lower price ideas this week.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
NORTH AMERICA
US: April sulphuric acid imports climb 28%
US imports of sulphuric acid for April climbed 28.2% year on year to 291,283 mt, leaving imports for the first four months up 8.4% at 1.12 million mt.
Although the majority of the April imports came from Canada, which supplied 159,993 mt, and much of the remainder came from Mexico, which supplied 58,001 mt, the US continued to increase its imports from Europe.
For April, Finland supplied 18,902 mt, Belgium supplied 18,121 mt, Germany supplied 18,058 mt, and Poland supplied 17,451 mt.
Canada: April sulphuric acid exports up 2.5%
Canada’s April exports of sulphuric acid climbed 2.5% year on year, but imports for the first four months of the year were still down 0.9% at 643,504 mt.
Effectively all of the tonnes went to the US.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Chile: April acid imports plunge 26%
Chile's April imports of sulphuric acid dropped 25.8% year on year to 176,276 mt, leaving imports for the first four months of the year down 2.2% at 778,487 mt.
Most of the April tonnes came from Peru, which supplied 104,130 mt, with the remainder coming from Brazil and Japan, which supplied 40,631 mt and 31,419 mt respectively.
These same three countries supplied almost all of Chile’s February and March imports too.
Chile: Spot market quiet and notional levels disputed
The spot sulphuric acid market in Chile remains quiet, with no new business reported this week.
Although most sources continue notionally to peg prices at $80-90/mt CFR, with the majority at the lower end of this range, others argue that this is unrealistic, with some in Chile suggesting that any sales above $80/mt CFR would be difficult to achieve. Indeed, some traders have suggested that recent business has been much closer to the $80/mt CFR.
There is little sign of an increase in Chilean spot demand, but with fewer tonnes leaving Mexico and Peruvian exports also likely to inch down, buyers may be more active in the spot market in H2.
Peru: March sulphuric acid exports down 8.5%
Peru’s March exports of sulphuric acid declined 8.5% year on year to 139,710 mt, although this was the largest monthly volume of exports since the previous March.
Total exports for Q1 at 330,087 mt were also down 8.5% on the year.
Almost all of the tonnes for March and the whole of Q1 went to Chile, other than 1,554 mt to Panama in March.
EUROPE
Europe: Spot export prices remain stable
Spot prices for sulphuric acid exports from Europe remained pegged at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with little firm indication of business outside this range.
Although some sources suggested that prices as high as $38/mt FOB would now be realistic, while others suggested that even prices in the $30s/mt FOB would be difficult to obtain, recent reported trades have remained at similar levels for several months.
However, some sources suggested that last week’s sale to Argentina, which was previously thought to be in the $90s/mt CFR, was in fact bought at $85/mt CFR for loading from Antwerp.
Turkey: Q1 sulphuric acid imports down 8%
Turkey’s sulphuric acid imports for Q1 2015 declined 8% year on year to 142,447 mt.
Almost all of the Q1 tonnes came from Aurubis's Pirdop smelter in Bulgaria, although 7,569 mt came from Italy.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: Q1 sulphuric acid imports climb 31%
Morocco’s Q1 imports of sulphuric acid were up 30.8% year on year at 244,767 mt, demonstrating a strong start to the year.
The imports were split between a range of European countries, with Spain, Bulgaria and Belgium the biggest suppliers, while Italy, Sweden, Norway and Germany made up the remainder.
Morocco’s imports for 2015 are still overall expected to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.
The country is forecast to continue importing sulphuric acid in 2015 as OCP conducts upgrade work across its installed capacity. Morocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility. CRU forecasts acid import demand at 590,000 mt in 2015.
Morocco: Spot quiet but offer levels heard declining
Moroccan spot sulphuric business has been quiet, as OCP has mainly been focused on term contracts and has offered little spot enquiry in recent weeks, market sources said.
However, a buyer source suggested that offers for spot sulphuric acid have declined $5-10/mt in recent weeks, and that current published Northwest European spot prices are above offer levels to North Africa.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Spot demand persists
Indian spot demand for sulphuric acid remained firm, with most pegging prices in the $60-70/mt CFR range and some reports of recent business as high as the mid-$70s/mt CFR.
Sources suggested that Indian buyers are having to cover product that was expected but has not been available due to Asian tightness. It is understood that delays in the startup of PPL’s sulphur burner have also
led to greater spot requirements, and some suggest this will persist to October, though the buyer has yet to confirm.
CRU currently forecasts stable sulphuric acid output from PPL this year and next at 660,000 mt/year, though this is expected to rise to 1.02 million mt/year in 2017 and 1.4 million mt/year thereafter.
India: Sulphuric acid imports jump 78%
India’s sulphuric acid imports for March climbed 77.6% to 100,300 mt, leaving Q1 imports up 22.6% at 282,717 mt.
South Korea was the source of 39,231 mt, while Japan supplied 26,970 mt.
Of the remaining tonnes, 19,493 mt came from the Philippines, 8,002 mt came from North Korea, and 6,600 mt came from Taiwan.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Two Lions not exporting as Chinese prices climb
Two Lions is not currently considering spot exports of sulphuric acid, as domestic Chinese prices have been increasing and international offers from Japanese and South Korean sellers are lower than the price level the producer would be seeking.
Sulphuric acid prices in China climbed a further RMB 10-20/mt in several regional markets over the past week. Inner Mongolia has seen increases of around RMB 20/mt as several smelters have shutdowns in the May-June period. This affects Hubei province too as they buy acid from Inner Mongolia.
In Jiangsu, where Two Lions is located, sulphur burners have also increased prices because of short upcoming maintenances.
Japan/South Korea: Spot prices climb on tightness, Indian demand
East Asian spot prices for sulphuric acid exports have been reported higher by several sources, with business reaching $30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea and one trader suggesting that deals had been done even higher.
Some sources continued to peg the upper end of the price range at $25/mt FOB.
Tight availability has meant that buyers have had limited options to meet spot requirements and have had to pay more in many cases.
The lack of spot availability and high CFR levels to India supported the increase, and India remains the main source of spot demand.
A lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi’s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko’s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc’s Onahama smelter.
The PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc’s Onsan smelter shut May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days, though the length has yet to be confirmed.
Japan: April sulphuric acid exports drop 10%
Japan’s April exports of sulphuric acid declined 9.9% year on year to 213,739 mt, leaving exports for the first four months of the year down 5.8% at 926,166 mt.
The Philippines remained the key destination for Japanese acid, taking 86,976 mt of the April tonnes.
India was the next largest importer, taking 56,174 mt.
Thailand took 26,159 mt, Australia took 21,999 mt, and Chile took 10,503 mt. The volume to Thailand is the largest monthly volume from Japan to that country since February 2014.
