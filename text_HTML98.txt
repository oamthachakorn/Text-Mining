ANALYSIS
Pakistan at centre of attention ahead of tenders
Producers and traders that have been busy preparing for the two TCP tenders closing May 29 and June 1 will be keenly following the sessions to seek more clarity in the urea market which is currently dominated more by bulls than bears.
The tenders will provide a better understanding of traders' perceptions of the prompt market, and will also be a significant test for regional delivered values for Chinese and Middle East product. High Chinese prices for prills, quoted well above $300/mt FOB for June would imply netbacks some $10/mt higher for Middle East producers, potentially reducing availability for the US and Brazil accordingly.
Bullish sentiment on the spot market for prilled and granular urea did also prevail as participants in the 83rd annual IFA Conference gathered in Istanbul this week, but some more caution did emerge, even for the shorter term.
The more bearish outlook for Black Sea urea was however dampened substantially via May 28 news that CherkassyAzot is one of the Group DF plants to close following the decision by DF to suspend production at all Ukrainian units. While the Cherkassy urea output has been limited to less than 50,000 mt/month lately, the decision will likely have a significant psychological impact on the short term regional urea market.
Surging values for granular urea in the US came to a halt as the IFA Conference was ending, with bargeloads changing hands up to $30/st off recent peaks. The driver at New Orleans is flooding in the Arkansas River markets that will make some June arrivals competitive while barge traffic waits to move north and west again. Furthermore, the timing of the delay means the inevitable end to the seasonal bull market for barges probably has moved to the start of June, rather than the end of the month. On the other hand, the sudden shortage in the largest urea consuming market in the US has added $5-20/st to truck prices in the Southern Plains this week.
European distributors were meanwhile struggling to keep up with immediate demand, and spot trades in inland positions in Italy moved up sharply on pockets of demand that needed to be covered.
Forward prices in Europe are nevertheless in line with numbers posted in recent weeks, and buyers maintain a relaxed attitude on availability and showed no intentions of stocking up at prevailing prices.
Similar sentiment was also evident in Brazil where buyers continue to reject quotes based on prior sales by Middle East producers above $310/mt FOB. Indications of possible interest reflect returns some $10-15/mt
lower, but potential sales by Middle East producers in Pakistan might alter the approach by the Brazilian importers.
Highlights of the week
∙Group DF suspends urea output from Cherkassy Azot
∙US granular may be coming off their seasonal peak
∙Producers and traders prepare for TCP tenders in Pakistan
∙STC likely to float Indian urea tender early June
∙Netbacks in Egypt inch higher
∙Brazilian importers still reject high offers
∙Chinese suppliers maintain hard line on exports
Short term outlook
Mixed. Many signs point to significant downward adjustments in prices, but uncertainty over the duration of the cutbacks in Chinese export volumes and the suspension of Group DF exports attract sufficient attention to conceivably support prices well into June.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Too wet for field work, prices unchanged
Prices were unchanged but relatively little field work has occurred this week due to wet weather over the prior couple of weeks. Quotes for granular urea remain at $370-375/st FOB Midwest from river terminals and inland warehouses. Demand may benefit in coming weeks as some farmers give more consideration to urea and UAN instead of ammonia due to ground conditions.
US NOLA: Market turns midweek, floods block barges
After holding its ground around $355/st FOB New Orleans, granular urea barges lost almost $30/st late May 27 and May 28 as barge movement up the Arkansas River was substantially blocked by high water from flooding in Texas and Oklahoma.
Business was concluded around $355/st FOB early in the week. However, offers at $345/st FOB, $340/st FOB, $338/st FOB and $337/st FOB were reported and business was confirmed as low as $325/st FOB for prompt barges in the US Gulf. While floods are pulling back in the US interior, the delay moving up the
Arkansas River means barges discharging in coming days can now compete for enduser business previously limited to barges already loaded in the Gulf.
US S Plains: Flooding boosts warehouse values
Deadly flooding in Texas and Oklahoma is extending the halt to field work that wiped out most regional activity last week. At press time there was no word from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) over when or where the agency might close traffic on the Arkansas River due to high and fast moving water.
However, barge carriers were not adding tows to the river's lineup. This in turn enabled warehouse sellers to boost demands for spot trucks to $370-390/st FOB throughout the region. Some distributors are scrambling to meet commitments tied to barges unable to move up the Arkansas River.
At press time, local media in Oklahoma and Arkansas reported water was falling from levels up to 10 feet above flood stage at some river ports and terminals.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Buyers still reject high quotes for granular urea
Brazilian buyers are maintaining that prospects for a softer forward market for granular urea are such that purchases of forward positions as offered in the $330s/mt CFR are not viable. Indications of buying interest circulating in Istanbul were in the upper $310s/mt CFR, and buyers were in no rush to conclude.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic Sea: EuroChem books Salavat granular urea
EuroChem booked a total of 26,000 mt granular urea to load end June/early July in the May 27 Salavat tender originally floated for the sale of 20,000 mt to load early July. The exact price in the transaction was not released, but local reports suggest that the deal was struck around $315/mt FOB.
Prills are on offer at $288-293/mt FOB depending on quantity, loadport and time of loading, but buying interest remains subdued. Traders are thus far unwilling to assume forward length and netbacks on open business in Latin America are below the $285/mt FOB marker.
Black Sea: Prices stable week on week
The IFA conference in Istanbul did not serve as a platform for further substantial increases in Black Sea prices for prills, but news of Group DF suspension of output from its Ukrainian plants could trigger additional price increases. The suspension includes urea from Cherkassy Azot.
Limited trades in Turkey were indicative of netbacks around the $285/mt FOB marker. Quotes from producers are no lower than $292-294/mt FOB, but widespread reports of sales by OPZ at $290-291/mt FOB
for June loading could not be confirmed. The suggested deals have therefore not be included in the range posted for the week.
While the duration of the closure of urea output from Cherkassy remains uncertain, the loss of close
to 50,000 mt urea per month from the Black Sea will be significant for nearby markets such as Turkey and Italy where NF Trading has been feeding its distribution network.
Shipments in May from Yuzhnyy/TIS appear set to pan out a little short of 150,000 mt, including about 30,000 mt for Egypt and 30,000 mt for Mexico, destinations that have not been featuring notably from Yuzhnyy since quite some time.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: OCI suggested as buyer of MOPCO parcel
OCI is now suggested as the buyer of the 3,000 mt granular urea sold by MOPCO pursuant to the May 21 tender at $320/mt FOB for prompt lifting.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: STC in line for new tender in June
Indian importer STC is expected to float a new tender for urea to complement the relatively limited 775,000 mt procured by IPL via the May 9 session. The new tender for an unspecified quantity of urea is expected out in the first week of June, and will likely permit shipment through Agust 15-20.
The Department of Fertilizers will be keenly watching offers in the TCP tenders in Pakistan closing May 29 and June 1 for guidance on pricing in the region.
Sri Lanka: MoA to tender for urea June 9
Sri Lanka's Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) is to tender on June 9 for 36,000 mt granular urea plus 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea.
The full quantity is to be available for distribution in bags in Colombo in August, implying shipment by the end of July/early August if loaded from China and the Middle East. The tender will provide an indication of traders' and producers' perceptions of the forward market for both urea grades.
Pakistan: ECC clears additional imports
Pakistan's Economic Co-ordination Committee (ECC) has finally cleared the import of a further 150,000t of urea for Kharif application. The ECC clearance has been pending since the Fertilizer Review Committee recommended the additional imports in early April.
The tenders will follow the two sessions by Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) set to close May 29 and June 1 for 50,000 mt each. The 150,000 mt requirement is expected to be split into three separate TCP tenders for 50,000 mt each, likely to close late June, allowing for shipment by July 20-25.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
South Korea: Dongbu, Namhae testing regional prices
Dongbu is reported to have taken an additional 4-5,000 mt granular urea from China marginally below $325/mt CFR, suggesting a netback to the seller around $305/mt FOB from China.
Ameropa was widely associated with the deal. Namhae was in discussions with suppliers in Istanbul for a parcel of about 6,000 mt granular urea for late June delivery, but a deal had yet to be confirmed at press time.
Indonesia: Kaltim V production improving
While production of ammonia at the facility is up to about 75% of rated capacity, output of granular urea from Kaltim V is currently running at about 45% of the unit's rated 3,500 mt/day capacity due to technical issues. The producer has not indicated a date for completion of the repairs currently being made to the plant.
Thailand: Buyers yet to concede higher granular prices
Importers in Thailand are yet to give in to demands from sellers for prices above $330/mt CFR and cite renewed approaches from traders offering Iranian granular urea.
While up on last week's $305/mt CFR deal, offers at $310-312/mt CFR for Iranian material are suggested in support of calls for lower offers from traditional sources. Contract cargoes priced via formulae are suggested arriving around an even $320/mt CFR, but suppliers are pushing hard for better returns.
China: Urea values up, domestic may be near peak
Domestic values for prilled and granular urea in China firmed further this week as local distributors continued purchasing in preparation for the peak application season for corn. Prills for prompt export were again sold close to $300/mt FOB to traders short for India at netbacks some $12-14/mt lower, with offers for June closer to $305/mt FOB.
Offers for granular urea for export are maintained well above $310/mt for regular Chinese quality, and above $320/mt FOB for premium product.
Offers at high prices did however slow activity somewhat as acceptance of the higher numbers at retail level is yet to be fully tested. Estimates on availability versus demand differ substantially, and a more cautious approach has been noted.
Mainstream domestic trades in prills at RMB 1,680-1,700/mt ($271-274/mt) EXW in northern China were up by RMB 30-50/mt ($5-8/mt) on last week. Similar increases were also recorded in Shanxi where product traded at RMB 1,620-1,650/mt ($261-266/mt) FCA.
Domestic buyers are competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export as high as RMB 1,730/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $304/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporters.
Domestic values for granular urea for export were up to RMB 1,780/mt CPT northern ports, indicative of an export price at $312/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. Offers circulating May 28 were above RMB 1,800/mt CPT.
Inventories in ports for export are down on last week. Yantai inventory is assessed at 220,000 mt this week compared to 300,000 mt last week. The inventory consists of about 130,000 mt granular urea and 90,000 mt prills. Arrivals into the port have slowed to about 10,000 mt/day.
Indonesia: Kaltim fails to achieve target-price
The May 22 tender for the sale of 30,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim to load by June 15 that had been restricted to a limited number of participants attracted one bid only, at $305/mt FOB Bontang.
The producer had been targeting netbacks in excess of the $311-311.50/mt FOB concluded with Fertcomm and Ameropa for 30,000 mt each in prior sessions, and is currently in discussions with traders, attempting to secure an improvement in pricing for the cargo still available. A further cargo of around 30,000 mt is also being discussed for later loading.
China: April urea exports close to 850,000 mt
April exports of urea from China were limited to about 850,000 mt, down sharply on the 1.31 million mt exported in April 2014.
The drop in volume reflects the firmer stance against low prices adopted by the China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association that triggered rejections of bids from traders at levels below returns available in the domestic market.
The April volume did nevertheless lift January-April exports to about 5.28 million mt, still some
61% ahead of the 3.27 million mt exported in the first four months of 2014. May 2015 exports are also predicted relatively low, likely in line with the 545,000 mt exported in May 2014.
