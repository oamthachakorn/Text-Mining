Argus FMB Sulphuric Acid
Issue 15-23 | Thursday 18 June 2015
Market summary
Supply tightness eases; market remains bal- anced
Both Europe and Asia have seen deals completed this week as tightness seems to be easing up both sides of Suez.
After months of European smelter acid producers speaking of being sold out of available spot tonnage, some sellers have suggested that the level of tightness has eased. Earlier in 2Q, producers were ready to refuse bids below $40/t fob NW Europe, but some sources have revised this down to the mid-$30s/t fob.
There are two recent spot sales of smelter acid to OCP in Morocco, sourced from Nordenham, Germany and Kris- tiansand, Norway. The cargoes are 6,000t and 7,000t respec- tively, and will load in the next few weeks. They are both understood to fall within the current North Africa cfr range of $50-60/t cfr Jorf Lasfar.
What this also shows is that demand is also still prevalent for European acid. OCP is still buying acid from offshore while two Brazilian buyers are back in the market. First is Mosaic, which closed a tender on 18 June for 10,000-12,000t for August delivery, and Petrobras is looking to establish a year- long contract for 4 x 15,000t shipments. The delivery date for these four cargoes is understood to start in 4Q 2015.
In India, PPL having bought another cargo of 18,000t smelter acid from a Far East Asian producer. The cargo was sold via a trader and is understood to have been completed in the mid-$50s/t cfr east coast India. The cargo is understood to be a distressed cargo and sold at a low fob level, and there- fore is not indicative of the current price range for South Korea/Japan or India.
PPC in Japan is also understood to have sold a spot cargo to a Chinese buyer for under $40/t cfr.
Outlook: stable and balanced, with supply loosening up a little.

Highlights this week
PPC sold a 19,000t cargo to a buyer in China for under- $40/t cfr.
A producer has sold a distressed cargo of 18,000t via a trader to PPL in India from the Far East. The price is understood to be in the mid-$50s/t cfr east coast India, well below the current range.
OCP has purchased two spot cargoes from NW European smelters, due to load in June and July.
Qatar’s Tasweeq is thought to have made an award to a trader for second half July loading.
When China failed to return to the spot market as an- ticipated after the Chinese New Year in February, prices eroded slightly but did not enter a free-fall. Some argue that it was down to a structural market tightness, which is expected to provide support to sulphur prices and poten- tially to prevent prices from falling sharply even if Chinese buyers decide to withdraw from the market in the next few weeks.
Outlook: Prices slowly edging up.
Fundamentals
Supply - Metals and ores
Chinese imports of copper ore fell 5.7pc in May when compared to the previous month, though the total pattern of the last year shows a 40pc increase on ore imports in May 2014, showing a large overall rise in recent months.
Supply - Sulphur
In China this week, various deals for granular sulphur have been reported in the $160-163/t cfr range, showing a slight increase on last week.
Aramco Trading in Saudi Arabia has sold 35,000t of spot sulphur to a trader in the high-$140s/t fob, and this is be- lieved to be coming from Yasref for July loading in Yanbu.

Demand - Leaching and industrial
Copper prices took a fall this week on economic cues re- lating to US interest rates and Greek debt talks. The metal settled on 18 June at $2,080/t, a three-month low.
Nickel prices saw a similar drop for the same reasons as copper, falling to $12,580/t on 18 June.

There is a slightly more bearish tone in Brazil this week with reports of some offers dropping to the $490s/t cfr but these are likely from floaters.
In India, demand currently is slow as buyers are well- covered for the kharif season and importers feel time is on their side to purchase for the rabi season. Indeed, over 3mn t is estimated to be lined up for April-July and some suggest that the Indians could be in a position to continue to sit out in July if prices are not favourable.
Outlook: market to remain stable-to-firm through 3Q.
Zinc also hit a two-month low of $2,080/t on 18 June, following in the path of the other two base metals listed above.
Demand - Fertilizers and agriculture
In phosphates, Brazil and India are still in a hiatus period against relatively comfortable suppliers. However, trade activity has picked up in several other markets including Argentina, Turkey, Pakistan and Southeast Asia.
Sulphuric acid this week
South America
Brazil
Demand remains stable in Brazil, as two buyers have re- turned to the market.
The first is fertilizer producer Mosaic, which will close a ten- der on 18 June for 10,000-12,000t. The cargo is requested to arrive at Paranagua, Brazil in August. Seller price indications have been quoted in the low/mid-$80s/t cfr Paranagua.
Morocco – OCP is continuing to buy spot acid, and is due to receive 6,000t ex-Nordenham, Germany in end-June, along with another cargo, of 7,000t from Kristiansand in Norway
Brazil – Petrobras and Mosaic in Brazil are both in the market. Mosaic’s is for 10- 12,000t for August de- livery, while Petrobras looking to establish a year-long contract for
4 x 15,000t for delivery starting in 4Q 2015.
India – PPL has purchased a distressed cargo of 18,000t from a trader for Far East smelter acid in the mid-$50s/t cfr east coast India.

The second enquiry was issued by energy company Petro- bras. The acid byer wants to establish a year-long contract for 4 x 15,000t for shipment beginning 4Q 2015. Offers are requested to be submitted on 23 June, and no price indi- cations are currently known. Petrobras' most recent ten- der was for 15,000t (for 25 June-5 July delivery) and was awarded in the mid-$80s/t cfr Barra dos Coqueiros.
This demand from Brazil is currently keeping the European market balanced, with Paranapanema also expected to be looking for tonnage in the coming months.
Chile
Chilean market remains quiet and balanced-to-long. A few participants in the market are understood to be arranging timeswaps. The Chilean market is slightly long, partially due to problems following the flooding in late March. Also con- tinuing are issues at Antofagasta's Antucoya project, which was still in the ramp-up process.
Cuba
Moa sulphur burner operational in 4Q16
Construction of the second sulphuric acid plant at Sher-
ritt's Moa facility is going smoothly and now expected to be operational by the final quarter of 2016, slightly pushed back from estimates announced back in March. Moa's second sul- phur burner will have 2,000 t/day of sulphuric acid produc- tion capacity (around 667 t/d of sulphur consumption).
Once the new sulphur burner is operational, Moa will cut back its smelter acid imports, estimated at around 500,000 t/yr, and raise its sulphur consumption, mainly sourced from the west coast of Canada. All sulphur-based acid production will be for captive use.
Mexico
Mining giant Grupo Mexico has confirmed that its Buenavista mine is still undergoing expansion work, and will be com- pleted by August. Once this expansion has been completed, the mine is expected to consume around 6,000-7,000 t/ month, all of which will be sourced from the company's La Caridad smelter.
Currently, Grupo Mexico produces around 1mn t/yr at its various operations in Mexico, 60pc of which is sold to the US market, and the remaining 40pc of which is either used captively in Mexico or sold to the Chilean market.

PCS will close its sulphur-burned sulphuric acid plant at Geismar, Louisiana, by 18 June, according to the company, putting an end to the long-anticipated shutdown. The plant was originally scheduled to close 31 May, but that deadline was pushed back to a date that was "most advantageous to the company." PCS is closing the facility because of expenses needed to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The company cut emissions related to phosphoric acid production at the fertilizer production site in 2013.
The plant consumes an estimated 150,000 t/yr of sulphur to make around 450,000 t/yr of sulphuric acid, and will now procure its supply in the merchant market. It is understood that the majority of the facility’s sulphuric acid needs have been covered on a contractual basis, but market partici- pants expect PCS to take some tonnes from the spot market.
Africa and Mediterranean
Morocco
Currently, OCP in Morocco is continuing to buy spot acid, though there is speculation that cargoes to Jorf Lasfar would slow because of OCP's new fertilizer plants. It is understood that 6,000t has been fixed to load in Nordenham, Germany in end-June, for shipment to Jorf Lasfar, Morocco.
Another cargo is due to be fixed to ship 7,000t from Kris- tiansand in Norway to Jorf Lasfar. The date of this cargo does not appear to be finalised yet. These two cargoes are both understood to have been sold within the current cfr range for North Africa of $50-60/t cfr.
Spain
Atlantic Copper, a smelter in Huelva, Spain owned by Freeport-McMoRan, will undergo a planned maintenance in September this year. The turnaround will last around two weeks. The shutdown will likely mean the loss of around 50,000t acid from the market.
Europe
NW Europe
In Northwest Europe this week, talk has continued on third quarter contract negotiations. With the market understood to be balanced, players on both the buy and sell sides agree that a rollover is the most likely outcome. Only sulphur-
burned acid producers have spoken of an increase due to the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar causing sulphur prices to rise while acid prices fall. This happened in 2Q but may not happen again in 3Q. The contracts for the third quarter will likely be finalised in the next week or so.
Elsewhere, producers of smelter acid are understood to be not as tight as early 2Q. While few spot deals have been completed (other than the two small cargoes to OCP listed under Africa/Mediterranean), smelters in Europe are now suggesting that tonnage is available. These producers have stated that they would be willing to sell in the mid-$30s/t fob NW Europe, which is a decrease on the $40+/t fob asking price being quoted earlier in the quarter.
Asia
Japan/Korea
The market remains balanced in Asia. While deals have been few in recent weeks, small amounts of movement has been seen, indicating that tonnage is available in the Far East.
The exact extent of availability is not clear, though Pan Pa- cific Copper completed a spot sale at the beginning of June. The cargo is 19,000t, going to Southern China. The buyer is thought to be a previous term contract holder. This is under- stood to be the first cargo to sent from PPC to this buyer for over a year. The price is heard to be under $40/t cfr, netting back to around $15-20/t fob Japan/South Korea.
Traders and market participants alike have noted that prices in Japan and Korea have remained fairly stable. With demand in India fairly stable at present, and some tonnage available at smelters in the Far East, our price assessment remains at $25-32/t fob Korea/Japan, though some market participants have suggested that it may be closer to the lower end of the range.
PPC his thought to have only 10,000t spot tonnage avail- able until the end of the year, and is unlikely to complete any more spot deals until the turnaround at its Saganoseki smelter is completed. In October or November, the smelter will be put into turnaround, which will last approximately 40 days. The smelter produces around 120,000 t/month. During this time, Sumitomo's Niihama smelter will also undergo a turnaround for 20 days. Niihama's monthly production is also around 120,000t, and these two temporary shutdowns will likely keep the acid market in Asia balanced for the remain- der of 2015.

Freight rates from South Korea/Japan to east coast India have increased from $30-35/t to $34-38/t.
India
Indian demand is understood to be stable at present. As most major consumers have finished their 2Q turnarounds, the need for acid is not as strong. This year's monsoon is understood to be better than originally forecasted, but still not as strong as many had hoped for.
PPL is understood to have completed a deal via a trader for Far East smelter acid. The company has purchased a cargo of 19,000t for first half of August arrival. The deal is under- stood to have been completed in the mid-$50s/t cfr east coast India. This is a distressed cargo and will not be used to assess the current price ranges in Asia.
China
In China, a turnaround is understood to be coming to an end at the Yanggu Xiangguang smelter. The smelter, which serves the domestic market, produces around 1.5mn t/yr sulphuric acid, and was down for around two weeks. This resulted in the loss of 50,000-60,000t acid from the domestic market, and is understood to have increased the domestic price in Shandong province. Currently, the range for the region is believed to be RMB 370-400/t exw.
Jiangxi Copper will reportedly undergo a maintenance at one of its smelter complexes in late June or July. It is unclear which smelter is being put into turnaround, but it is understood that it serves the Yangtze River area, and that it will affect sulphuric acid supply in the area.
Import and Export data - Asia
In the period January-March 2015, exports of acid from Belgium were 60pc higher than they had been the previous January-March period. The country shipped 171,327t in the first three months of this year, up from the 107,316t posted in the same timeframe last year.
This is mainly due to a 40pc increase in the amount of acid Belgium sent to the Netherlands in this timeframe. Bel- gium shipped 52,636t to the Netherlands in January-March, up from 37,551t the previous year.

Shipments of German acid from January-March 2015 totalled 68,839t, which is only a 1pc decrease on shipments during the same period last year.
Shipments to Poland, Netherlands and the Czech Re- public all fell during this timeframe compared to last year, however an increase in tonnage sent to Belgium - Germany's largest offtaker of acid - helped make up for the deficit.
