ANALYSIS
US wind carries granular higher for a little longer
Traders in the US granular urea market have been expecting prices to correct, perhaps violently "next month" for about three months. Maybe it will happen in July, presumably before the industry gathers at the annual Southwestern Fertilizer Conference.
This week flooding that has prevented barge travel along the Arkansas River for two weeks, and likely for another week to 10 days forced distributors to truck granular urea hundreds of miles the Mississippi River to Arkansas, Oklahoma and southern Kansas. The alternative was to pay more for the few spot barges remaining at the mouth of the Arkansas River, and pay they did. While barges in the Gulf or along the upper Mississippi River sold at $341-355/st FOB, barges positioned closer to the Arkansas River or able to discharge to trucks heading west sold as high as $370/st FOB.
The constant expectation of a correction in US prices in prior weeks and months prevented many cargos from being added to the US lineup that might have eased the tight market by now. While the end of seasonal US demand should relax US support for global pricing, there can be little doubt the US system will be substantially drained. Outside of programmed Middle East granular, most of the late July spot granular arrivals will total about 70,000 mt of Chinese granular split between a full cargo owned by China Oil and a part cargo for Trammo. However, if CF's urea expansion starts up as planned in August then the need for substantially more replacement tons from overseas should be eased in the near term.
Trades in barge positions for first half July around $315/st FOB have been used to assess current Middle East netbacks for the US trade as tonnage off vessels yet to load would only be available in July. The resulting netback to regional producers is still ahead of returns in spot markets such as Brazil.
Opinions on the global market for granular urea differ widely, and the cliff from which prices were expected to fall as indicated in the June 4 issue of Fertilizer Week appears to be more of a moving target than originally anticipated. Multiple sellers point to this week's deals for granular urea from Kaltim as a regional floor in values through the first half of July, while several buyers refer to the concessions made by Kaltim as evidence of forward weakness.
Middle East producers also conceded minor discounts in sales of tonnage outside contract commitments this week, with one Omani cargo reportedly booked at an even $310/mt FOB. Offers for additional tonnage are however limited and are priced above the $310/mt FOB marker. The presence of Iranian availability was felt again in Turkey this week where sales concluded reflected Middle East netbacks well below $295/mt FOB and returns to North African producers below $310/mt FOB.
The pockets of opportunity to sell granular product at the higher values perceived by market bulls are nevertheless diminishing as peak demand will soon subside in the US and in Europe. Global importers that are attempting to evaluate the risk in delaying forward procurement versus prospects for sustained values beyond mid-July are faced with no easy task, but playing the waiting game could well be the best strategy for requirements beyond July.
Brazilian buyers cite limited inland offtake and poor forward prospects in support of decisions to remain sidelined and procurement has largely stalled.
On the reverse side of the market-coin, Chinese suppliers of prills are maintaining a firm stance on prices and have booked substantial volumes with traders short for India and Pakistan above $300/mt FOB. Demand is perceived substantial for the coming 30-60 days as India will need to return to the markert shortly and three Pakistani tenders are set to be floated in June. Limited unsold volumes in Chinese ports sugest that availability into July will be relatively tight, but prospects are for substantial additional volumes after the Chinese corn application ends.
Netbacks in prills from the FSU did move slightly lower this week as traders needing to cover prompt positions had completed most purchases in the rush of activity that took place from the Black Sea last week, but limited output from Ukraine suggests that major downward corrections are unlikely in the short term, despite the re-emergence of Iranian granular in Mediterranean markets.
In Australia, ABARES provided production forecasts. Citing lower plantings and the potential for El Nino to lower yields on the east coast, wheat output was cut to 23.6 million mt. Conditions in major fertilizer consumption areas have been dryer than normal over the past month, which has allowed for good planting progress. Rain over the coming weeks will be needed to boost urea and UAN applications.
Highlights of the week
∙US granular gained in prompt, 1H July markets
∙Kaltim adjusts prices and concludes major volume
∙Chinese prilled values almost at par with granular
∙New Indian urea tender yet to be announced but is suggested imminent
∙Pakistan tenders yet to be floated, but also suggested imminent
∙Sorfert in Algeria back up, but AOA output may have been suspended
∙EFC cargo from Egypt to head for the US
∙Brazilian importers maintain hard-line
∙Algerian exports continue and output to normalize shortly
Short term outlook
Mixed. Market perception is split almost evenly between bulls and bears, but a general agreement for downward adjustments in granular values from recent US peaks is in place. The timing and the extent of such corrections do however remain open for substantial debate.
A significant drop in US values is nevertheless expected for barges trading for delivery for the second half of July. These corrections are set to influence global values substantially, but are already largely accounted for in Middle East spot values.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest/Great Lakes: Demand keeps prices steady
Granular urea sales remain steady across the Midwest and in the Great Lakes states. A steady supply of replacement urea primarily by barge is helping to keep prices stable around $375/st FOB from river terminals, but as high as $395/st FOB in Michigan and Wisconsin. Urea is in greater demand than last year for top-dress on corn, according to anecdotal reports from distributors.
Mexico: Group books prills and SAN with Uralchem
The Mexican Group of importers is evaluating offers received June 10 against its June 10 request for cover for up to 25,000 mt prilled urea in combination with 5,000 mt stabilized AN.
Details of offers submitted were not released, but suggestions are that an award is being processed to Uralchem for the combination. The urea will likely have been priced marginally below $310/mt CFR for east coast Mexico discharge. This is based on an assessed $288/mt FOB value plus freight around $20/mt from the Baltic.
The prior sales of granular urea to Tepeyac and Isaosa for the west coast now appear possible to be shipped from Indonesia, given this week's purchases by CHS and Samsung from Kaltim of 2x30,000 mt for June loading.
US S Plains: Truck values flat despite spot outages
So far this week quotes for granular urea from Arkansas River terminals generally are not cited above
$390/st FOB. The flat pricing at this level over the last few weeks has held even though replacement costs out of the barge market are in the $350s/st FOB New Orleans. The lack of barge travel due to high water along the Arkansas River also is adding to distributors' costs for now.
Buyers have been forced to truck urea and other products from terminals along the lower Mississippi River and from New Orelans to Oklahoma and elsewhere. Distributors reported June 10 that Koch was limiting sales from its Enid Oklahoma plant due to heavy demand.
US NOLA: Prompt barges getting much stronger
Prompt granular urea barges sold as low as $341/st FOB New Orleans this week, but most of the activity was for barges at Rosedale and for the few still available along the Arkansas River. Most trades occured at $350-360/st FOB, but at the end of the week bidding wars erupted for well-placed barges. Those few barges sold as high as $370/st FOB June 11.
Prilled urea, most of which is believed to be of Russian origin, has sold at $310-313/st FOB New Orleans this week.
Access for new tows to move up the Arkansas River may take more than a week to be restored. Travel as far as the central and western Oklahoma likely will not be restored before July 1, according to transportation sources. Barge carriers had to stop moving new tows on to the Arkansas River when heavy rain in Oklahoma and Arkansas led to flooding.
The alternative for Arkansas River distributors that need prompt granular urea has been to buy truckloads from lower Mississippi River terminals and even from New Orleans for the long journey to Arkansas, Oklahoma and soutnern Kansas.
US N Plains: Wider price spread emerges in Dakotas
Granular urea is available as low as $380/st DEL in the Dakotas this week, although some distributors still are posting nearer to $400/st DEL. Product is arriving mostly from the Twin Cities in Minnesota, with no logistical problems reported. Demand has come later than expected in some parts of North and South Dakota, with dry conditions in some areas blamed for the slow start.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Importers maintain hard line on prices
Brazilian importers of granuar urea are maintaining bids around the $320/mt CFR marker despite offers well into the $330s/mt CFR. Buyers contend that offers at $328/mt CFR were available this week for parcels off inbound carriers, but elected not to pursue the tonnnage even at that number.
Sales in Indonesia at $308/mt FOB and from Middle East at $310/mt FOB imply costs to traders above $330/mt CFR main Brazilian ports, but the slowdown in inland purchasing continues to impact importers' willingness to add to existing length at current values.
Brazil: Urea imports continue to decline
Brazilian imports of urea through May identified by customs via GTIS of 1.03 million mt declined by close to 34% compared to the first five months of 2014. Imports in May of 179,000 mt were down by 51.8% on May 2014.
Imports from Qatar in May 2015 of 127,600 mt were nevertheless up by 18% on May 2014, but deliveries from Kuwait of 22,000 mt and from Russia of 21,000 mt in May 2015 were off by 55% and 17.5%, respectively.
Qatar also maintained the lead position in January-May imports with supplies of 396,000 mt, up by 26% on the same months in 2014. Arrivals from Russia of 245,000 mt were down by 18%, shipments from Oman of 88,400 mt were off by 28.4%, and deliveries originating from Kuwait of 78,600 mt were down by 50.2%.
Deliveries from the UAE of 71,200 mt were down by 33% and Venezuela accounted for 44,500 mt down by 70%.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic Sea: Netbacks dip marginally in new trade
Netbacks to producers loading from the Baltic Sea were back down into the $280s/mt FOB this week via a sale in Latin America of a cargo to load in combination with stabilized AN.
Uralchem was widely suggested as the supplier of both products in the deal concluded with the Mexican Group of Importers. The return to the seller is assessed around $288/mt FOB less transaction costs.
Black Sea: Trade in prills slows on trader resistance
Trade in prilled urea from Yuzhnyy has slowed following last week's scramble by a few traders to secure cover for prompt short positions. Netbacks on small sales in regional markets are back down to the low $290s/mt FOB at best as buyers in Mediterranean markets with the ability to receive large carriers resort to premium granular product from Iran to cover requirements.
Supply in June and into July does however remain limited, and traders have disposed of prior length.
Shipments and fully firm nominations for vessels to load from Yuzhnyy/TIS terminals in June are yet to exceed 40,000 mt:
EUROPE
France: Forward quotes back down
The forward market for granular urea is back to "normal" again with sales for summer positions and beyond around an even €300/mt FCA in the French Bay and in the mid-€290s/mt FCA in southern France.
Trade in prompt positions has come to a halt, and the forward values are thus applied this week in the assessment of the FCA price-point.
Trades at €302-303/mt FCA reflected delivered values around $325/mt CFR, suggesting netbacks to North African producers below $295/mt FOB. Iranian urea on offer in Turkey this week around $315/mt CFR with credit reaffirmed the perceived market value for the granular material.
Turkey: More Iranian granular urea trades
A cargo of Iranian granular urea has been sold to importers in southern Turkey around $315/mt CFR including credit. The parcel is likely to be split between two or more receivers. Buying interest is otherwise limited to small parcels of FSU prills for industrial use by importers such as Yildiz and Kastamonu.
The 30,000 mt Iranian cargo will lift imports from Iran further from the 138,000 mt registered by customs via GTIS from January through April, up by a full 516%.
Total January-April urea imports by Turkey of 459,000 mt were nevertheless down by 7.6% on the prior year. Deliveries from Ukraine were up by 9.6% to 236,000 mt and arrivals from China were up from 2,100 mt to 37,200 mt. Russia suffered a major setback with deliveries down by 88.5% to a mere 20,000 mt.
April imports of 103,000 mt were down by 14% on April 2014. Ukraine accounted for 61,400 mt, down
by 11.4% while arrivals from Iran of 33,000 mt were up by 721%. Shipments from Russia of a mere 5,000 mt were down by 83%.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: Granular values holding reasonably well
Middle East producers continue to cite limited availability for the next 30-45 days in support of quotes for sales outside contract commitments above $310/mt FOB, and one sale was concluded at that number this week.
Returns on open business in key spot markets such as Brazil are nevertheless still below $305/mt FOB, and Brazilian buyers maintain a "wait and see" attitude.
Buyers in Thailand are aiming below $325/mt CFR for spot and contract tonnage, citing this week's sales of Kaltim product for June lifting at $308/mt FOB.
Sharply contrasting the spot market at $365/st FOB, forward barge values at New Orleans that would apply for vessels arriving in the first half of July are around an even $315/st FOB, indicative of delivered values of $340/mt CFR. This suggests Middle East producer netbacks after deduction of freight and transaction charges marginally above $315/mt FOB.
Firm offers in paper markets for full July positions from the Middle East that were posted June 11 at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $301/mt FOB against bids at $295/mt FOB.
Algeria: Sorfert urea output back up
Output of ammonia and granular urea from the Sorfert I integrated units was back up and running close
to the 1.3 million mt/year rated urea capacity June 8, according to the producer. The plants had been down since May 17, following a technical issue.
Following shipments of around 100,000 mt in May, the producer has accepted nominations for four vessels from contract holders Indagro (27,500 mt), Nitron (14,000 mt plus 6,000 mt) and Hermlm (3,000 mt) to load in June.
Local reports suggest a temporary suspension of output at the AOA unit, but this could not be confirmed with the producer.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: May urea imports down yoy but sales increase
Indian urea imports in May 2015 of 471,000 mt were down on the 618,000 mt imported in the same month a year earlier, according to the latest provisional FAI trade data. Aggregate April-May 2015 imports marginally in excess of 1 million mt were also down on the 1.49 million mt imported in the first two months of the 2014- 2015 Financial Year (FY).
Contrasting the lower imports, sales of urea in the first two months of FY 2015-2016 totaled close to 4.6 million mt, up by 22% on the prior year. Sales in May 2015 of around 2.47 million mt were up by about 14% on May 2014.
Closing May inventory with individual states was assessed at 425,000 mt, down sharply on the 835,000 mt at the same time in 2014, but those volumes do not take into account material stored in ports and in transit to states.
News on a follow-up tender pursuant to the May 9 IPL session is yet to emerge, but a tender is expected to be issued shortly, likely by STC.
The Indian government has meanwhile cleared continued operations at the three naphtha-based urea units of SPIC, MCFL and MFL until the feedstock can be replaced by natural gas. The units have a combined rated capacity of around 1.5 million mt/year, servicing Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala states.
Nepal: AICL issues a further tender
Nepalese importer AICL floated a further tender for bagged urea. The session to purchase 25,000 mt bagged prills closes on July 24 at 13:00hrs local time and calls for the urea to be delivered on CIP terms to AICL warehouses at Biratnagar, Birgunj and Bhairahawa.
Delivery is requested for about 50% of the quantity within 97 days from L/C issuance, with the balance to be delivered within 20 days thereafter. Offers are to remain valid for 21 days.
The May 7 AICL tender for 35,000 mt bagged urea for delivery to the same warehouses was awarded to Swiss Singapore at the trader's offer at $383.99/mt CIP.
Pakistan: Government may raise import duty by 2%
The Pakistani government has proposed a 1% increase in the customs duty in the 2015-16 budget to 2% on certain fertilizers including urea, DAP, MOP, NP, and SSP.
A final decision on whether to confirm this increase will be taken by June 20. The proposal is just one of a number of tax increases suggested in the budget as the government looks at ways to reduce its fiscal deficit, but there will be opposition to any rise in costs for agricultural inputs.
TCP is meanwhile yet to announce dates for the three urea tenders for 50,000 mt each pursuant to the clearance secured from the ECC to proceed with the 150,000 mt procurement, but announcements are expected in June.
Sri Lanka: MoA June 9 tender heavily oversubscribed
The June 9 MoA tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags for August distribution in Sri Lanka attracted offers from 13 traders. Offers for granular were submitted for 398,000 mt and offers for prilled or granular totaled 270,000 mt.
Prices were widely spread for both grades, ranging from $347.26/mt CFR to $379.50/mt CFR for the granular and from $345.86/mt CFR to $377/mt CFR for the prills, all inclusive of 270 days credit.
Dreymoor was lowest for the granular at $347.26/mt CFR. This was followed by Quantum at $350.30/mt CFR, and by ETA at $354.87/mt CFR for Middle East product. Dreymoor also submitted the lowest offers for the prills at $345.86/mt CFR while Valency was at $347.77/mt CFR.
Offers for the granular also included Liven at $355.43/mt CFR, Ameropa at $357.21/mt CFR, Valency at $356.44-357.33/mt CFR and Dragon at $359.99/mt CFR. All other offers were at/above $360.60/mt CFR.
Other offers for prills included Liven at $349.43mt CFR, Ameropa at $352.30/mt CFR, and Quantum at
$352.43/mt CFR. AgriComm offered at $352.90/mt CFR and ETA was at $356.87/mt CFR. All other offers were above $359/mt CFR.
The total cost package for material originating from China is assessed around $52/mt for freight, bags, bagging, financing and reloading, suggesting netbacks to traders around $295/mt FOB for the prills and a minor premium for the granular.
All offers except those from ETA and Valency specified Chinese origin.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Thailand: Importers cite aggressive offers for granular
Thai importers report offers for Chinese and Indonesian granular urea below $325/mt CFR, and appear in no hurry to add purchases.
The buyers cite ample availability from Indonesia as evidenced via this week's sale in support of calls for lower offers, while sellers cite the same deals with suggestions that these are all covering prior commitments by traders and are therefore setting a definite regional floor for granular values into July.
Vietnam: Indonesian granular and Chinese prills offers
Vietnamese importers report lower offers this week for granular urea from Indonesia and for prills from China. Daewoo is reported to have booked 6,000 mt granular urea out of its 16,000 mt $308/mt FOB purchase from Kaltim in the low $320s/mt CFR while Chinese prills for July loading are suggested available as low as $310/mt CFR.
Indonesia: Traders buy as Kaltim concedes discount
Traders short on prior sales and some adding length purchased several cargoes of granular urea from Kaltim this week as the producer agreed to lower its price target from $313/mt FOB Bontang to $308/mt FOB.
CHS booked 30,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim for June shipment at the $308/mt FOB Bontang and Samsung is reported to also have taken 30,000 mt at the same price. The cargoes are allegedly destined for Australia or the US, but the recent sales by the traders to Incofe and Tepeyac suggest that the parcels could head for the west coast of Guatemala and Mexico.
Daewoo booked 16,000 mt intended for Vietnam, and Koch took 10,000 mt for Thailand, all for June lifting. Koch also reportedly booked an additional 30,000 mt for July loading with open destination, all at $308/mt FOB Bontang.
Kaltim had originally been holding out for a $325/mt FOB netback but subsequently reduced the target to $313/mt FOB and then conceded a further $5/mt to $308/mt FOB.
China: Undertone softer but no crash on cards
Chinese farmers are busy with the wheat harvest, but will be concentrating on application of urea for corn in coming weeks. Mainstream domestic trades in prilled urea at RMB 1,700/mt ($274/mt) EXW in northern China were up by about RMB 20/mt on last week. Trades were recorded in Shanxi at RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) FCA.
Domestic buyers are still competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export at RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $307/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporter, but interest in prills at the higher numbers is limited.
Offers for July and August shipment in the June 9 MoA tender in Sri Lanka reflected trader expecations of cover being available well below $295/mt FOB for prills and only marginally higher for granular. Offers for July parcels of prills in Vietnam reflect similar values, if not lower.
Prospects of an imminent tender in India and the three upcoming sessions in Pakistan for 50,000 mt each have however boosted sellers' resolve to hold out for high prices well into July. The major part of tonnage in inventory has already been booked by traders that were short for the previous Indian and Pakistan tenders.
Domestic values for granular urea for export were relatively flat at RMB 1,680-1,700/mt FCA in Shanxi, with the high end indicative of an export price at $315/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. Small sales to regional export markets nevertheless continue to be made at returns below $310/mt FOB.
The softer tendency in regional export values for granular urea was also evident via sales of Kaltim urea in Indonesia that were concluded at $308/mt FOB Bontang for the superior quality comparative to that of China Blue. A total of about 116,000 mt did however trade at the $308/mt FOB benchmark for June and July lifting, implying that traders see limited short-term potential for lower prices.
Inventories in Chinese ports for export have decreased on last week, but not substantially. Yantai inventory is still assessed above 250,000 mt with some suggestions that 300,000 mt may be available. Laizhou inventory is assessed at 50,000 mt.
Australia: More granular urea to arrive from Indonesia
Imports of urea through April identified by customs via GTIS of 493,000 mt in Australia were off by a mere 1% compared to the same period in 2014.
The flurry of activity in Indonesia this week does however suggest an increase in forward volumes as traders CHS, Samsung and possibly Koch appear inclined to ship cargoes purchased from Kaltim for June/July loading to Australia.
Arrivals from Qatar of 147,000 mt through April were meanwhile down by 29% and deliveries of 123,000 mt from Saudi Arabia were off by 23.5%.
Imports from the UAE were lifted from zero to 100,000 mt while arrivals from Oman of 14,500 mt were down by 14.5%.
Malaysia captured sales of 40,000 mt, up from zero in the first four months of 2014, but deliveries from Indonesia were down by 57.5% to 30,000 mt.
The April volume of 94,700 mt was down by 34.7% on April 2014, with Saudi Arabia accounting for 63,200 mt and Indonesia for 30,000 mt.
Malaysia: Urea exports up sharply in March
Malaysian exporters enjoyed a significant increase in shipments of urea in March as the Chinese dominance in exports from the region waned on calls for higher netbacks from the China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association.
The March volume from Malaysia identified by customs via GTIS of 112,000 mt was up by 295% on March 2014. Shipments to Chile of 27,500 mt were up from zero and deliveries to New Zealand of 27,000 mt were up from 1,700 mt in the prior year. Thailand accounted for 21,300 mt, up by 5.1% and shipments to Australia of 20,000 mt were up from zero.
Q1 2015 exports of 299,000 mt were up by 49.7% on Q1 2014 with the Philippines the largest client with 92,000 mt, up by 196%. Shipments to Australia were up from zero to 52,000 mt while the volume of 36,500 mt loaded for Thailand was down by 46.6%. Deliveries to the US of 30,000 mt were off by 49.8%.
