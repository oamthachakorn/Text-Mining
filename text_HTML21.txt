Formerly FMB Weekly Phosphates Report
Issue 15-23 | Thursday 18 June 2015
Market summary
Brazil and India remain at a pause
The two key import markets, Brazil and India, are still in a lull and this is reflected in marginally weaker offers in Brazil where prices appear to have slipped sub-$500/t cfr. Prices in India, however, are stable and the Chinese are reluctant to meet Indian counter bids in the low/mid-$470s/t cfr. While the key demand regions have slowed, interest has emerged in several other markets. Argentina has booked Australian MAP at $505-507/t cfr. Turkey has taken a Russian DAP cargo at above $510/t cfr. Pakistan has booked another Saudi DAP in the high-$480s/t cfr. ETG has purchased a second Saudi MAP cargo in the mid-$480s/t fob while southeast Asia has taken a total of 50,000t Chinese DAP at $472-475/t fob. ICL has also confirmed that one of its two TSP/SSP plant at its Rotem site is still operating following a fire on 11 June.
Outlook: stable

Market analysis
The global phosphates market remains stable. Brazil and India are still in a hiatus period against relatively comfort- able suppliers. However, trade activity has picked up in several other markets including Argentina, Turkey, Pakistan and Southeast Asia.
Although the market is stable overall, there is a slightly more bearish tone in Brazil this week with reports of some offers dropping to the $490s/t cfr but these are likely from floaters. The pause in Brazil has been put down to two key reasons. The first reason being the availability of the credit
package announced by the government two weeks ago. Some argue that Brazilian demand inland has come to a halt as farmers are not willing to purchase any fertilizers until the credit announced by the government is available. There are reports that this could take as long as 45 days for the credit to appear in the banks.
The second reason is the poor correlation between fertilizer and soybean prices, which has been deterring farmers from purchasing fertilizers. Due to the lack of farmer demand, distributors are reluctant to build inventory until there is more movement inland.
Suppliers, on the whole, are largely undisturbed by this hia- tus and are confident that Brazil will return to the market, mostly because they believe it has to. This is supported by latest Anda figures which report a 19.1pc drop in phospho- rous-based fertilizer consumption during January-May 2015 while imports fell by nearly 27pc year-on-year. Offers have largely remained stable around $500/t cfr.
A similar view is taken on India. Demand currently is slow as buyers are well-covered for the kharif season and im- porters feel time is on their side to purchase for the rabi season. Indeed, over 3mn t is estimated to have been lined up for April-July and some suggest that the Indians could be in a position to continue to sit out in July if prices are not favourable. But suppliers are not concerned about this slowdown as another estimated 2-2.5 mn t is required for the rabi season, equivalent to an average of around 800,000t/ month for August-October. Of this, roughly 200,000-250,000t could be met by the Saudis, Jordanians and possibly Rus- sians, leaving the Chinese with the lions' share. Moreover, the monsoon is progressing well which is also providing an overall positive picture.
With lukewarm trading forecast in India over the next few weeks, the Chinese are focused mainly on shipping MAP to Latin America. Port congestion times in Brazil are around
40-45 days and if product is to arrive in time for September, vessels need to be loaded fairly promptly. Vessels for Argen- tina have a little more time with the loading window likely coming to a close mid/late-July. After this, focus will be mainly on India with additional demand from Pakistan while Southeast Asia is expected to continue buying small 6,000t DAP cargoes consistently through Q3. Pakistani demand continues to emerge with another Saudi cargo sold this week while rumours of a Chinese cargo sold is also circulating.
The outlook remains stable-to-firm through Q3.

North America
US
Mosaic has sold 17,000t of DAP to various Latin American markets at $470-474/t fob for July shipment.
Higher shipments to India and Latin American countries boosted US exports of DAP/MAP in May to their highest monthly total since May 2014.
The US exported 236,180st P2O5 of DAP/MAP (estimated 450,000-510,000st product) in May, a 33.8pc month-on-

month climb but down 4.8pc from the same month last year, according to the Fertilizer Institute (TFI).
The US shipped 75,945st P2O5 to India in May, the highest monthly total since October 2014 and the second consecu- tive month it has sent exports to the major DAP consumer since October-November 2014. These shipments were up about 63pc both from May 2014 and April 2015. Year-to- date shipments to the country are up 73.1pc compared to January-May 2014.
The US exported 113,640st P2O5 to South American coun- tries in May, the largest sum since June 2014. May shipments to the region were up 41.7pc from April but down 11.5pc from the same month last year. Exports to Brazil were 87,090st P2O5, in line with April, while shipments to Colom- bia and Peru totaled 15,683st and 10,867st, respectively. The US exported 9,532st to Central American countries, 8,366st of which went to Guatemala.
The US did not export any DAP/MAP to Australia in May for the second month in a row. Calendar year-to-date exports to Australia stand at 71,114st P2O5, down 32.7pc from January- May 2014.
Canada received 10,047st P2O5 in May from the US, down 46.1pc month-on-month and a 79.3pc fall from the same
month last year. The US exported 11,736st P2O5 to Mexico in May, down 18.5pc from April and 31.8pc from May 2014.
Higher May exports led January-May US P2O5 exports to reach 869,339st, a 3.4pc year-over-year increase.
Domestic
The US market continues to trade in a tight range, though activity is seasonally limited. Domestic DAP for July loading traded within the prevailing $418-420/st fob Nola range this week. Despite the lack of buying interest, downside price pressure appears to be limited for DAP/MAP barges given Nola’s stark discount to other import markets. At current values, a rash of imports to Nola are unlikely over the com- ing months. Price upside could be limited by sustained lower crop prices, which could result in phosphate application cutbacks in the fall.
Central and Latin America
Brazil
The Brazilian market is marginally weaker this week against continued sluggish demand due to a lack of movement in- land. Farmers are awaiting credit from the government while others blame the poor correlation between fertilizer and crop prices.

Some suppliers have reportedly dropped their offers slightly for MAP 11-52 to the $490s/t cfr. However, most offers are continuing to be made in the $500-505/t cfr range. Suppli- ers are unconcerned about this pause in the market and are confident Brazil will return to the market, for no other reason than they have to.
YUC reports selling Chinese 11-52 to Brazil at $500-505/t cfr but this is unconfirmed on the buy side.
A trader is offering the balance of an Australian MAP cargo at $500/t cfr Paranagua while Russian MAP is understood to be offered at $495-500/t cfr.
Chinese 11-44 is on offer at $395-405/t cfr while 10-50 is of- fered at $450-455/t cfr, both for discharge at Paranagua.
Brazilian fertilizer sales dropped by 21.4pc to 2.07mn t in May from a year earlier, Brazil's fertilizer industry associa- tion Anda said.
In the first five months of 2015, fertilizer consumption fell by 12pc to 9.04mn t compared with the same period of 2014.
Domestic fertilizer production declined by 4.9pc in May to 708,216 t from a year earlier, but rose by 5.5pc in the first five months of the year to 3.62mn t compared to the same period of 2014.
Fertilizer imports declined by 5.5pc in May to 1.79mn t and fell by 18.4pc to 7.26mn t in the first five months of the year.
The trends reflect a weakening Brazilian currency versus the US dollar, as well as a decline in investments in crop inputs as farmers seek to trim costs amid rising interest rates and tighter margins.
Phosphorous-based fertilizer consumption shrank by 19.1pc to 1.15mn t in the first five months of 2015 because of a de- cline in demand in sugar cane and second-crop corn sectors, as well as a decline in purchases for the upcoming soy plant- ing season which begins in September. Domestic phosphate production rose by 4.2pc, while imports fell by nearly 27pc in the January to May period.
Brazil's largest grain-producing state Mato Grosso accounted for the highest share of fertilizer consumption in the first five months of 2015, at 1.73mn t, followed by Parana state with 1.36mn t and Sao Paulo state with 1.14mn t.
Brazil recently began harvesting its second-crop corn. The country's crop supply company Conab estimates that the 2014/15 second-crop corn harvest will reach 49.4mn t, a 2pc increase from the 2013/14 crop. Overall grain output is seen reaching 204.5mn t this season, up by 5.6pc.
Local agricultural consultancy Agroconsult is projecting that the recent hike in interest rates for the farm sector could decrease soy-planted areas in the upcoming 2015/16 crop season.
As a result, Brazilian fertilizers sales are expected to decline this year for the first time since 2009, according to market estimates. The bulk of the decline will come from imports, with domestic production increasing.
Argentina
A trader has reportedly sold 30,000t Australian MAP to an Argentinean buyer at $505-507/t cfr for July shipment.
Another trader has sold 30,000t of Chinese 10-50 at $473- 475/t cfr. The cargo is loading now.
YUC reports to have sold Chinese 11-52 for June shipment at $500-505/t cfr.
Europe and former Soviet Union
Russia
EuroChem has sold 20,000-25,000t Lifosa DAP to Turkey at a netback indicated above $485/t fob. The parcel will load in late June/early July.
The producer is now sold out on Lifosa DAP for June. In ad- dition to the Turkey cargo, EuroChem will also ship 15,000- 20,000t Lifosa DAP to eastern Europe and 20,000-30,000t to Western Europe.
Eurochem is targeting $485/t fob for July MAP loaders to deep sea destinations.
PhosAgro has sold its last June DAP/MAP cargo for loading at the end of the month but no further details are available. It has already started selling July cargoes and is targeting around $480/t fob for deep sea destinations.
PhosAgro has indicated it will ship around 200,000t/month MAP/NPKs to the domestic market each month during June- August.

According to latest GTIS data, Russian MAP exports in April fell by 44pc year-on-year to 74,177t. Of this total, 42,413t went to Estonia and 11,601t was shipped to Italy.
MAP shipments during January-April 2015, however, were up 9pc year-on-year to 596,024t. The bulk of the exports were shipped to the US (231,430t), followed by Estonia (138,344t), Belarus (41,693t) and Brazil (40,965t).
Russian DAP shipments in April fell by 37pc year-on-year to 49,074t, of which 24,749t went to Estonia and 19,277t went to India.
DAP exports during the first four months of 2015 rose by 133pc to 555,853t compared with 239,071t in the correspond- ing period one year earlier. Estonia was the top destination during this period taking 107,912t, followed by France with 99,320t and the US with 90,662t.
Lithuania
DAP exports in April were down by 62pc year-on-year from 71,699t to 27,206t, according to latest GTIS statistics. Just under a third of the shipments went to Germany (10,004t) while 6,166t was shipped to Ireland and 4,000t went to Spain.
DAP shipments during the first four months of the year decreased by 8pc year-on-year to 250,613t, of which 74,143t went to the Netherlands, 62,033t to Germany and 46,006t to Ireland.
Turkey
EuroChem reports the sale of 20,000-25,000t of Lithuanian DAP to a Turkish buyer at a price indicated above $510/t cfr duty free for June loading.
On the export front, Bagfas is quoting $505/t fob for July DAP sales and will have 20,000-30,000t available.
A trader is understood to have purchased around 35,000t of DAP from Bagfas for southeast Europe for shipping in several lots. However, this deal was concluded a few weeks ago.
Italy
DAP is next used in autumn but current market prices are not tempting buyers to book and store. Latest bulk offers to blenders are €495/t fca, reflecting around €515/t fca bagged. Several traders/sellers are holding stocks in Ravenna.
1Q 2015 DAP imports totalled around 77,000t, down 26pc
year-on-year, according to GTIS data. This reflects the disap- pointing DAP consumption this season, a result of compara- tively high DAP prices versus crop returns.
france
The market for DAP has remained seasonally quiet with new demand expected in the second-half of July. Distributors are buying small spot quantities at €475-480/t fca Rouen. This is €10-15/t lower than initial offers. DAP sellers are offering DAP in dollars at $530-535/t fca.
EuroChem is understood to have a new DAP cargo arriving into Rouen in July. The cargo is reported to have been sold at around $500/t fob Klaipeda, which would translate to around €475-480/t fca Rouen.
Spain
The Tarragona port authorities said that levels of phosphates traffic through the Spanish port of Tarragona fell in the first four months of the year to 31,703t, a 33pc fall on 47,201t through the port in the same period in 2014.
Belgium
There is still no interest in purchasing DAP for fall cereal ap- plications. Offer prices in Ghent/ARA ports remain steady at $530-535/t fca.
Africa and Middle East
Saudi Arabia
Ma'aden reports the sale of 25,000t DAP to Pakistan at a net- back price in the mid/high-$470s/t fob for end-June loading.
The marketer has also sold 30,000-40,000t MAP to South America for first-half July loading in the low-$500s/t cfr, net-

ting back to the low-$480s/t fob.
Sabic has sold a second 30,000t MAP cargo to South Africa in the mid-$480s/t fob for second-half July shipment.
Sabic is sold out for July, when it will ship 2 x 30,000t MAP cargoes to South Africa for ETG and a 25,000t DAP cargo for United Agro in Pakistan.
Sabic's DAP offers for August shipment to west coast India and Pakistan are in the $490s/t cfr.
Ma'aden still has two July cargoes available which will most likely be DAP. It will target markets in East Africa and South- east Asia targeting a price in the mid-$480s/t fob.
Tunisia
There are various rumours on the status of GCT’s produc- tion. Some report that GCT’s Gabes plant is back up and running with shipments lined up for Italy and Turkey while others suggest that the producer is encountering logistical issues concerning the transfer of rock to Gabes.
Unconfirmed reports also indicate that its Sfax plant may have returned to operations with a TSP shipment scheduled for Bangladesh at the end of this month.
South Africa
ETG has purchased a second MAP cargo from Sabic for second-half July shipment at a price understood to be in the mid-$480s/t fob.
Indian subcontinent
India
No fresh sales have been reported this week. Offers are still around the $480/t cfr level and reports of buyers counter- ing in the low/mid-$470s/t cfr are continuing basis adequate supplies for the kharif season and time on their side to purchase for the rabi season. The value of the rupee has depreciated to around Rs64.15:$1 which is also encouraging importers to counter at lower prices.
Argus FMB estimates Indian DAP deliveries for April-June to total around 2.5mn t with around 600,000t forecast for July, taking total imports to an estimated 3.1mn t for April-July. This is more than adequate for the kharif season and buyers are now more focused on liquidating current stocks, encour- aged by a good start to the monsoon season.
Issue 15-23 | Thursday 18 June 2015
Monsoon Watch
Total rainfall during 4-10 June was normal at 26.2mm. Above normal rainfall was recorded in the south peninsula and northeast India during this period while rainfall over the northwest and central India was deficient. Overall rainfall since the start of the monsoon (1-10 June) is also normal at 36.4mm.
Pakistan
Ma'aden has sold 25,000t DAP to Engro in the high-$480s/t cfr for end-June loading. The price has not been confirmed on the buy-side. Ma'aden has now raised its offer to $495/t cfr for July loaders.
Fauji is understood to be evaluating offers following its in- quiry last week for a 30,000-40,000t DAP cargo. It is thought that around 3-4 offers were submitted with rumours of offer prices in the high-$480s/t cfr.
Rumours that PakArab has purchased a Chinese cargo in the mid-$480s/t cfr are also circulating. But this could not be confirmed at press time.
Bangladesh
Quantum is understood to have been awarded one Australian DAP cargo under the recent Bangladeshi tender for 400,000t DAP. The cargo will ship in June.

China
YUC reports the sale of a total of 50,000t DAP to Southeast Asia at $472-475/t fob for June loading.
Wengfu has sold 5,000t DAP to Japan for end-June shipment in the low-$480s/t fob.
Most major producers are understood to be sold out until early/mid-July and are offering DAP at around $470/t fob.
Moreover, there are unconfirmed reports that Chinese DAP is being secured at $470/t fob for the recent Bangladesh tender.
As of 18 June, DAP stocks at Chinese ports totalled 340,000t, compared with 430,000t two weeks ago. This includes 110,000t at Zhanjiang port, 100,000t at Fangcheng port and 70,000t at Beihai port.
With Indian demand slow, producers are focusing on MAP for Latin America. YUC says it has sold a total of 40,000t MAP
11-52 to Brazil and Argentina at a netback price of $465-470/ t fob. It also reports the sale of 50,000t MAP 10-50 to Brazil at $440/t fob. These parcels will be shipped in June.
On 11-44, prices have been indicated in the low/mid-$370s/t fob for July loaders.
Domestic
The domestic DAP market remains steady. The DAP price in the southwest is being maintained at RMB3,000-3,050/t for northeast delivery, equivalent to RMB2,650/t ex-works while Hubei producers are still holding at RMB2,700/t ex-works. The increasing sulphur price is also supporting producers' offer prices.
Issue 15-23 | Thursday 18 June 2015
The MAP price is also remains stable-to-firm this week, sup- ported by strong demand from NPK producers. The main- stream MAP price is steady at around RMB2,000/t ex-works for 55pc powdered MAP in the southwest and at RMB2,100/t ex-works in Hubei province. Producers are shipping MAP to NPK producers and gMAP to the ports.

TSP
France
Some interest in TSP for storage has emerged with buyers covering some of their needs ahead of the harvest in 2-3 weeks’ time. Spot prices for TSP in Rouen are €365-370/t fca.
Brazil
Non-Chinese TSP is being indicated at $400/t cfr while Egyp- tian SSP 18-20pc P2O5 is on offer in the range of $185-200/t cfr depending on grade and port.
Israel
ICL is still assessing damages at its Rotem site which suffered a fire on 11 June. The site has two plants which can produce both TSP and SSP. One plant is understood to be down com- pletely as a result of the fire. Its second plant is in opera- tion. This suggests that the company will have one TSP cargo a month until the first plant returns to operations.
NPK
Vietnam
NPK imports in May totalled 48,576t.
Russia
PhosAgro will load 70,000t of NP/NPKs onto the Alpha Afovos this week for India. The cargo will be loaded at the new smart bulk terminal at Ust-Luga, which officially opened on 16 June (see Company News).
There are reports that PhosAgro has entered into a NPK sup- ply agreement for Colombia.
Germany
EuroChem Agro is understood to have issued new 15-15-15 prices of €340/t cif inland.
France
Interest in complex fertilizers is slowly picking up with some distributors starting to re-stock for the new season. Higher phosphate costs have pushed up the prices of NPKs by €10-20/t over the previous year. NPK 15-15-15 is on offer at €350-355/t fca.

Company News
New fertilizer terminal opens at Ust-Luga
PhosAgro and Ultramar have officially opened their new fer- tilizer terminal at Ust-Luga at a ceremony held on 16 June.
The smart bulk terminal (SBT) has a capacity to load more than 1.5mn t/year of fertilizers. So far in 2015, PhosAgro has shipped over 600,000t of fertilizers through the terminal after it entered a test mode in late 2014.
PhosAgro exports bulk fertilizers through Russian Baltic Sea ports as well as Kotka (Finland), Riga (Latvia), and Muuga (Estonia). PhosAgro will redirect volumes from Finland and the Baltic States to Ust-Luga. This will help cut logistic costs by around $10/t, according to Phosagro’s CEO Andrey Guryev.
The company aims to load around 50pc of its fertilizer exports at SBT and its European sulphur terminal in Ust-Luga in 2015. It will continue to ship through the Russian ports of Murmansk and St Petersburg as well.
The capacity of SBT may be increased to reach 3 mn t/year by 2016.
