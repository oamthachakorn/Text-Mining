Market Summary
Threat to SQM's Atacama mining license
There has been much discussion today of a move by Corfo, the Chilean economic development agency, to strip SQM of its mining concessions in the Salar de Atacama. This has been widely reported in the Chilean press.
It should be noted that Corfo has been unwilling to go on- record on this topic.
SQM and Corfo have been in arbitration since 16 May 2014. It has been widely known since the arbitration started that Corfo wishes to end SQM's lease agreement for its property in the Salar de Atacama early, and claims that SQM under- paid the royalties due to Corfo for its mining in the Salar de Atacama. The lease, which was signed in 1993, runs through to 2030. In one sense then, there is little new here. How- ever, Corfo is now expected to reject an arbitration judge’s recommendations at the next arbitration meeting on 9 July, seeking instead to revoke the Salar de Atacama lease.
SQM stated today that Corfo has not informed it of any deci- sion to abandon the arbitration process.

The Salar de Atacama is where SQM sources the raw material for its MOP, SOP, lithium carbonate, boric acid and magne- sium chloride. According to SQM, revenues from products derived from this raw material accounted for 39pc of SQM's consolidated revenue in 2014. SQM produces its NOP-based products from caliche ore sourced outside the Salar de Ata- cama, and this would (in theory) be unaffected if SQM lost its concessions in the Salar de Atacama.
At present there is not enough clarity on the matter. Corfo's plans for SQM have been public knowledge for a long time, and the arbitration process is ongoing. There is significant risk for SQM, however these latest reports do not contain much that increases it.
Elsewhere in the world, MOP markets are signalling in op- posite directions. In Europe and Brazil, suppliers are pushing for price increases - about €10/t and $10/t respectively for July shipments. However in Malaysia and Indonesia there are signs emerging that prices are slipping in the tenders for

second-half 2015 delivery. In India, it is understood that ICL and its customers have agreed contracts, perhaps 525,000t firm for IPL and 162,000t firm for Zuari. This is a very posi- tive sign for Indian demand, though concerns over the rupee and the monsoon continue.

Asia
India
Argus FMB understands that ICL has been in negotiation with customers and that the company will be shipping 525,000t firm to IPL and 162,000t firm to Zuari (with a 50,000t op- tion), though this is unconfirmed. Nothing is thought to have been agreed with CIL yet.
This takes the total known contracted tonnage to 4.275mn t firm with 550,000t optional (including approximately 150,000t unconfirmed from K+S to IPL). Once all contracts and tenders are settled we expect India to book 4.5-4.75mn t firm, with options taking this to 5.0-5.2mn t.
The total agreed across the various 2014/15 contracts was 4.4mn t firm with 200,000t optional.
There are reports that the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar (it has lost 1.1pc this week) has led some buy- ers to postpone shipments, in the hopes that it will recover shortly. Additionally, concerns over the monsoon continue; it is behind the normal schedule by some way, particularly affecting states in the northeast.
Madras Fertilizers Limited (MFL), an Indian NPK manufactur- er, has issued a tender for 20,000t pink MOP to be delivered in bulk to Chennai in July-August 2015. The tender closes on 6 July 2015.
A vessel has been fixed to carry 24,000t MOP and SOP from Hamburg to east coast India loading end-June/early-July; freight cost is estimated at about $27/t.

China
The domestic MOP market remains stable, though subdued, this week. Qinghai Salt Lake Potash Fertilizer Co maintains its rmb 2,000/t ($322/t) delivered for 60pc MOP crystal.
Russian pink MOP is still available at rmb 2,130/t ($343/t) ex- warehouse at major ports.
As of Thursday, MOP inventory at Chinese ports remained stable at 1.10mn t.
There is some expectation that the domestic market will continue to see weak pricing but stable demand for the next few months.
The domestic SOP market is in a similar state. Luobupo still holds its price at rmb2800/t ($451/t) delivered. The Mannheim producers still hold at rmb2900-3000/t ($467-483/
t)ex-works. There are rumours that Xinjiang railway has reduced the rail freight cost for SOP by rmb 50/t ($8/t) from 12 June. This should increase Luobupo’s competitiveness against the Mannheim producers, or leave room for further price decreases.
Thailand
BPC has fixed a vessel to carry 35,000t MOP from Klaipeda to Ko Sichang loading 17-20 July, with the freight cost reckoned at about $30/t.
Sri Lanka
The Ministry of Agriculture announced a tender on 15 June to fulfil the public sector requirement of standard MOP in bags.
The tender calls for 28,700t +/- 5pc for delivery in Septem- ber 2015. The receivers are to be Ceylon Fertilizer (16,300t) and Colombo Commercial Fertilizers (12,400t).
The tender closes on 29 June.
Issue 15-24 | Thursday 18 June 2015
In April the ministry awarded a tender for 24,000t standard MOP in bags to Uralkali at $345.75/t cfrfo 180 days credit.
Malaysia
Rumours continue of deals being done at low prices, un- confirmed at present. The fluctuation of the exchange rate continues to cause uncertainty. This week the exchange rate improved to 3.70 ringgits to the dollar, but this is much weaker than the 3.5-3.6 rate in January.
Indonesia
There has been little change in these markets, with tenders for second-half delivery still under negotiation. What seems quite certain is that prices agreed will not be higher than $320-325/t cfr equivalent.
Uralkali is shipping 25,000t to Indonesia in July against a spot sale. Uralkali is also shipping a cargo to Petrokimia Gresik against the tender for 2H 2015 delivery.
Vietnam
Vietnam imported 53,000t MOP in May according to official figures; this is significantly lower than May 2014, however the Jan-May 2015 total is still 10pc higher than Jan-May 2014.

Europe
Negotiations for the third-quarter contracts are unlikely to begin in earnest until July. Uralkali has been indicating to customers that it would like a €10/t increase for both standard and granular MOP from 1 July onwards. BPC is also looking for a similar increase.
Belgium Netherlands
Buyers continue to show little interest in re-stocking potash. Suppliers are pushing for €320/t cif inland to bring granular MOP prices in West Europe in line globally. There is of course resistance from wholesalers, particularly since there is still product priced at between €310-315/t cif inland or cpt truck in the distribution system.
France
Interest in re-stocking potash is still very limited. Spot prices are unchanged at €305-310/t fca seaport.
France imported 211,000t MOP between January-April 2015, a 7pc (-15,000t) fall from the year before. However this is still nearly 30,000t higher than the same period of 2013.
Imports from Germany were flat with the year before at 92,000t.
Imports from Spain, very likely from ICL's Iberpotash, rose 29pc (10,000t).

Snapshot - World potash prices/netbacks
Belarus
Belarus' MOP exports of 1.78mn t in January-April 2015 were 118,000t (-6pc) lower than the year before. A very large fall in shipments to Latin America (down 41pc), and a significant fall in shipments to Europe (down 17pc), were partially offset by increases in shipments to other regions.
The fall in shipments to Latin America is due largely to a 45pc (-269,000t) decrease in shipments to Brazil. Brazil has been a highly competitive market this year with suppliers unwilling to cede further share, which might explain some of this. Additionally, Brazilian demand over the period was down about 30pc generally. Shipments to Brazil over the Jan-Apr 2014 period were approximately a third of Belarus' exports; in the same period of 2015 they were less than 20pc.
Belarus' shipments to most European countries were re- duced, with particular effect in Poland (-33,000t).

However, shipments to northeast Asia (China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) rose 9pc - driven by a 62,000t increase in shipments to China, which totalled 410,000t over the Jan- Apr period 2015.

Russia
Russia's exports of 2.72mn t in January-April 2015 were 586,000t (27pc) higher than the year before, according to customs figures. In particular there was a sharp increase in shipments to Europe (up 85pc), north America (up 176pc), south Asia (up 50pc) and southeast Asia (up 89pc). This was partially offset by a 25pc fall in shipments to northeast Asia.
The rise in shipments to Europe was driven by a 83pc (57,000t) increase in shipments to Poland, a 161pc increase (58,000t) increase in shipments to Finland and a 65,000t increase in shipments to the Netherlands.
Increased shipments to India (up 42pc) and Bangladesh (up 115pc) drove the increase in shipments to south Asia (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan).
Southeast Asia has been a particular success for Russian ex- ports this year. Shipments to Malaysia over the period were up 150,000t (238pc) and to Indonesia up 62,000t (56pc).
Shipments to Vietnam rose 10,000t (15pc).
Senegal
Uralkali is shipping 10,000t standard MOP to this market in June.
North America
US
The US market is stable with limited activity ahead of expected summer fill producer price postings. The barge market may have already reached a fill level, with June/ July loading imports selling at $315-325/st fob Nola, the low end of which many view as a price floor. Domestic produc- ers have yet to announce formal fill prices, but are already understood to be forward-placing tons into inland US ware- houses ahead of the fall season.
California cuts farm water use
Regulators cut water supply to California's largest agricul- tural areas last week, the latest step in the state's efforts to curtail water use during a historic drought.
The fall in shipments to northeast Asia was driven by a 213,000t reduction in shipments to China (-28pc).
Russia: MOP exports January-April
The State Water Resources Control Board announced 12 June that there is insufficient water to supply senior water right holders in the San Joaquin and Sacramento areas.
TCalifornia's water rights are based on seniority. When the water system becomes insufficient to supply all right hold- ers, those with junior rights are forced to stop using water
to accommodate senior users.

California is an important market for Compass Minerals' SOP, as the top US producer for a number of high-value fruit and nut crops - traditionally seen as sensitive to the chloride in MOP. Water shortages have had little impact on yields for these crops so far; California is set to produce 1.9bn pounds of almonds in 2015, down only 1pc from 2014, according to the USDA. Additionally, plantings for the major field crops, including maize, wheat and soybean, are in line with histori- cal five-year averages. Compass expects that there will be some switching from annual crops (maize, wheat and soy- bean etc) to permanent crops (nuts, fruits etc), which should support demand for SOP.

their current level, largely of $330-335/t cfr, however none think a significant increase in prices is possible. Access to credit is a continuing problem.
Colombia
Uralkali has fixed a vessel to carry 20,500t MOP from St Petersburg to Baranquilla and Buenaventura, loading mid- June. The freight cost is estimated at about $32/t, reflecting among other things the cost of passing through the Panama canal to deliver to Buenaventura.
Chile
As discussed in the Market Summary, Corfo - the Chilean development agency - is said to be considering abandoning arbitration in its dispute with SQM and moving to remove the company’s mining concessions for the Salar de Atacama.

Canpotex invests in 700 new railcars
Canpotex is to invest $70mn in acquiring 700 custom- designed railcars from National Steel Car, an Ontario-based manufacturer.
Canpotex has bought over 7,000 railcars from National Steel Car since 1999. The cars are custom-designed for the spe- cific properties of MOP.
"Canpotex's success is due in part to our 43-year reputation as a reliable supplier of potash. The quality and innovative design of the railcars from National Steel Car will ensure we continue to reliably deliver the potash our global customers need, when they need it," Canpotex President and CEO Steve Dechka noted.

"The new joint venture will enable us to supply our custom- ers with our potassium derivatives reliably in the long term," said Patrik Wohlhauser, member of Evonik's Executive Board. "At the same time, it means we're making a significant contribution to the environmentally-friendly and sustainable production of potassium derivatives."
The plant is being built in response to European legislation requiring mercury-based KOH production to be end by 2018. The new plant is planned to use a more compliant process.
