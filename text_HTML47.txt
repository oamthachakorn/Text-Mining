ANALYSIS
Further price falls following large Middle East drops
There were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February.
The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq's $30/mt reduction of its QSP to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its OSP to $105/mt FOB.
Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downward pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.
Nonetheless, no Middle East spot offers were heard, and traders suggested that sellers had no spot availability until the end of February and were focusing on contractual volumes.
Price decreases were again reported across the board for Chinese sulphur, with falls in domestic, port, and international assessments. Many traders had already left on holiday, and the outlook for prices following the Spring Festival holidays will depend largely on how much product sellers push onto the market, as buyers in China are likely to need some tonnes for the domestic fertilizer season.
Some in the Indian market pegged prices as low as $100-105/mt CFR, but other players were sceptical. Adnoc’s OSP for February equates to the low-to-mid-$110s/mt CFR. Demand has been limited as Indian buyers have shown a preference for sulphuric acid and are currently comfortable with stock levels. India’s November 2015 imports increased 4% year on year to 90,490 mt, though imports for the first 11 months were still down 19% at 1.25 million mt.
Meanwhile, the announcement of production cuts at Mosaic’s US phosphate operations provided another bearish demand signal.
In contract news, Russian suppliers and Morocco’s OCP failed to reach a consensus and will therefore not settle Q1 contracts. Morocco’s other contracts settled so far have been reported ranging from the low $90s/mt to the mid-$110s/mt CFR, while Russia’s other contracts with North Africa were reportedly in the upper $110s/mt CFR.
Russia’s November 2015 exports plunged 42% year on year, with imports for the first 11 months of the year down 29% at 2.62 million mt.
Further European Q1 contracts were reported settled at decreases of $5/mt, though in some cases buyers continued to push for greater declines.
In other trade news, Kazakhstan’s December 2015 imports decreased 59% year on year to 163,781 mt, leaving full-year imports down 21% to 2.75 million mt.
Highlights of the week:
∙Chinese prices drop further
∙China's imports climb 17% in 2015
∙Indian buyers steering clear of spot
∙Reliance closes latest tender
∙Some Brazil Q1 settlements at $110-115/mt CFR
∙Med prices also down
∙Some European Q1 settlements down $5/mt from Q4
MARKETS
SULPHUR
NORTH AMERICA
US Gulf: Mosaic believed to have reduced Q1 supply
Mosaic is believed to have negotiated lower liquid sulphur volumes for delivery to its US Gulf phosphate operations during Q1, but it is unclear if it has turned away all of the sulphur to cover its announced phosphate production curtailment. This is because Mosaic said it would cut up to 400,000 mt of finished products, rather than providing a specific figure.
Correction: Last week's edition of Fertilizer Week should have posted a US Tampa contract liquid sulphur price tag of $95/lt FOB. The February 28 edition did not correctly update settled Q1 business, and instead posted $110/lt FOB. FW regrets any confusion that ensued.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Kazakhstan: Exports down 21% for 2015
Kazakhstan’s December 2015 imports decreased 59% year on year to 163,781 mt, leaving full-year imports down 21% to 2.75 million mt.
China was the main outlet for Kazakh tonnes in 2015, taking 1.34 million mt of exports, 13% less than in 2014.
China remained a key outlet in December, taking 77,384 mt of the December exports.
In December, Kazakhstan also sent 30,794 mt to Brazil, 18,000 mt to Benin, 16,000 mt to Lebanon, 11,991 mt to Lithuania, and 9,612 to Ukraine.
Kazakhstan had been increasing export volumes in recent years as the sulphur stockpile at Tengiz was drawn down. TengizChevroil’s stockpile was fully depleted in H1 2015, with export volumes decreasing in H2 2015.
Russia: November exports down 42% on year
Russia’s November 2015 exports of sulphur plunged 42% year on year, with imports for the first 11 months of the year down 29% at 2.62 million mt.
The largest taker of November volumes was
Morocco, with 46,271 mt. Other key outlets were
China (25,746 mt), Israel (20,186 mt), and
Argentina (14,038 mt).
Russia’s volumes to most of its key destinations declined in 2015 to November, although exports to Lithuania more than tripled to 198,189 mt and exports to Israel increased 40% to 115,068 mt.
Exports to the US reached 59,689 mt compared with only 10,998 mt over the same period in 2014 as the country increased its intake of solid sulphur.
Russia: Q1 contracts settled but no Morocco
Suppliers of Russian sulphur said they had settled Q1 contracts with North African buyers aside from OCP.
Settlements were reportedly in the high $110s/mt CFR.
Russian suppliers will skip Q1 contracts with Morocco.
EUROPE
Europe: Further Q1 contracts settled at minus $5/mt
European Q1 contracts for sulphur appeared to be near full settlement, with further settlements confirmed at $5/mt decreases from Q4.
Some buyers are pushing for greater decreases in the wake of the recent decline in the US contract price as well as falling prices elsewhere around the world.
European sellers had originally offered a rollover in December, but had since decreased this to minus $5/mt.
As downstream markets struggle, European sulphur buyers argue that they need to have similar raw material price decreases to their international counterparts in order to remain competitive. The US settlement at a decrease of $15/lt therefore provided extra impetus for a decrease.
But sellers have argued that the European liquid market itself is relatively balanced, with little basis for large price decreases.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
South Africa: Imports drop by a third in 2015
South Africa’s 2015 imports of sulphur were 33% lower than 2014 at 421,992 mt.
Tonnes mainly came from Saudi Arabia (35%), Kuwait (25%), Qatar (19%), and Canada (17%).
December imports were a mere 243 mt.
Foskor's phosphate plant has suffered a series of technical issues and labour disputes, and continues to have issues with power shortages, all contributing towards a lower operating rate and reduced sulphur imports.
It is worth noting, however, that some of the imports would likely have been for re-export to neighbouring Zambia, where South Africa sent 171,234 mt in 2015, 25% less than in 2014.
North Africa: Q1 sulphur contracts mostly concluded
North African Q1 contracts for sulphur supply are mostly settled, though some negotiations continued.
Contract settlements have been reported in a wide range from the low $90s/mt CFR to the upper $110s/mt CFR.
Meanwhile, Morocco’s OCP is not expected to settle Q1 contracts with Russian suppliers, as the two sides were unable to reach a consensus.
On the spot market, one source suggested that producer was being offered below $90/mt CFR, but this was not confirmed by sellers or traders.
Middle East: Spot assessed lower but business limited
Middle East spot prices were assessed lower based on sellers’ official postings as well as falling bids and prices around the world.
However, spot availability from Middle East sellers is reportedly lacking until the end of February, with sellers focusing on contractual business.
The lower end of the range is in line with Tasweeq’s February QSP of $89/mt FOB, while the upper end is in line with Aramco’s February price of $115/mt FOB. However, the upper end of this range is unlikely to be achievable on sales to any region in the current market, although most deem the lower end lower than is necessary to achieve sales.
UAE: Adnoc posts $105/mt FOB OSP for February
Adnoc posted an official selling price (OSP) of $105/mt FOB Ruwais for February, down $17/mt from its January level, according to market sources.
This represents a delivered price to India in the low-to-mid $110s/mt CFR.
It follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for February at $89/mt FOB Ras Laffan, down $30/mt from its December level. Aramco posted its February price mid-January at $115/mt FOB Jubail, down $13/mt from its January price.
Qatar: Tasweeq cuts QSP to $89/mt FOB for February
Tasweeq announced its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) for February at $89/mt FOB Ras Laffan, down $30/mt from its January number.
This marks the biggest drop in the QSP since April 2014. It is well below Aramco Trading's official February price of $115/mt FOB, which the producer posted in mid-January.
Prices have been under considerable pressure as a result of weak downstream fertilizer markets as well as increased global supply.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Assessment down but business lacking
Indian spot prices were assessed down at $110-120/mt CFR following global price falls, but firm indications and business were lacking.
Some in the Indian market pegged prices as low as $100-105/mt CFR, but other players were sceptical. Adnoc’s OSP for February equates to the low-to-mid-$110s/mt CFR.
Demand has been limited as Indian buyers have shown a preference for sulphuric acid and are currently comfortable with stock levels.
Meanwhile, most sources were under the impression that Reliance’s 25,000 mt sulphur sales tender, which closed January 28, was in fact scrapped, though this was not confirmed.
India: Imports up in November but down for 11 months
India’s November 2015 imports of sulphur increased 4% year on year to 90,490 mt, though imports for the first 11 months were still down 19% at 1.25 million mt.
Qatar supplied the majority of the November tonnes as the source of 45,374 mt.
Other sources of tonnes in November included
Kuwait (27,483 mt) and Bahrain (12,607 mt).
Qatar and Saudi Arabia were the main sources of Indian sulphur imports over the first 11 months of the year, with market shares of 34% and 28% respectively.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Price falls across the board but spot dead
Price decreases were again reported across the board for Chinese sulphur.
For international business, sources suggested conclusions around $100/mt CFR for granular product, but nothing was confirmed at this level. Some buyers were reportedly bidding around $90-95/mt CFR, and there were unconfirmed reports of offers at $100/mt CFR. Some argued that the lack of spot business meant that the real price level was $110-115/mt CFR, the upper end of which was in line with Adnoc's OSP of $105/mt FOB, though well below Aramco’s February price of $115/mt FOB.
Sources mostly reported crushed and molten sulphur in the $90s/mt CFR. There was a third-party report of a granular deal at $85/mt CFR as well as a molten deal at $88/mt CFR for March shipment.
Some importers questioned whether they would be able to obtain product at Tasweeq’s QSP of $89/mt FOB, with many believing that the low level was offered as an opportunity for the producer’s offtakers to make up for negative margins in previous months.
There was limited activity at all major ports, as many traders had already started taking holidays. At Nantong and Zhenjiang, granular product was offered around RMB 850-860/mt FCA, with prices at similar levels even at Qingdao, where quotes tend to be higher.
Port inventories climbed to around 1.44 million mt with traders on holiday while many consumers stopped moving product to plants from late January. Inventories may rise as high as 1.6-1.7 million mt by the end of the Lunar New Year holidays.
Domestic prices also fell further. Sinopec’s Puguang reduced its prices twice within three days, with its price at Wenzhou port down to RMB 880/mt FCA from RMB 930/mt last week and plant prices down to RMB 870/mt EXW from RMB 900/mt. The producer needs to clear as much stock as possible because of the Chinese holidays. Its inventories were around 25,000 mt at port and 60-70,000 mt at plant including granular and molten volumes.
Other refineries also lowered prices by up to RMB 70/mt.
Phosphate companies argue that sulphur prices should fall further because of downstream weakness. As these buyers will be producing at relatively high rates following the holidays for the domestic Spring season, they will need some sulphur. Price movement will therefore be highly influenced by how many tonnes sellers attempt to push into the market.
Japan: December exports down a third
Japan’s December 2015 exports of sulphuric acid plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.
The Philippines was the largest outlet for 2015 exports, taking 1.26 million mt, though this was 5% less than in 2014.
Exports to India, on the other hand, climbed to 503,372 mt from 379,532 mt.
Volumes to Chile declined to 319,910 mt from 421,635 mt, while exports to China plunged to 26,541 mt from 114,985 mt.
Most of the remaining volumes went to
Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Australia.
The Philippines was the key destination for Japanese exports in the month of December, taking 109,994 mt.
Other export destinations included India (18,098
mt), Australia (10,499 mt), and Taiwan (6,500 mt), with around 5,000 mt to each of Singapore and Vietnam.
