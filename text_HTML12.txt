Market summary
Prices fall in Asia ahead of Chinese New Year
Ammonia prices continued to decline this week, particularly in South Korea where Namhae has bought a 15,000t cargo from Yara for early-March delivery at $347/t cfr. Elsewhere in Asia, prices remain somewhat higher and Indonesia’s
CJ has reportedly awarded its latest tender of 6,000t to Petrokimia Gresik at between $365-370/t cfr. Activity out of east Asia is expected to slow down in the coming days as the Chinese new year holiday approaches, but buyers in the region will almost certainly be targeting a similar price to the one achieved by Namhae, when they return to work late next week.
Meanwhile in India, FACT received no offers in its 1 Febru- ary tender for two ammonia cargoes, and the producer has again this week issued another tender for two cargoes for February and March delivery. The tender closes on 5 Febru- ary, with offers to remain valid until 10 February. Overall Indian import demand for ammonia during January-February appears to have been fairly good, and this is expected to continue into March if ammonia cfr prices remain at, or below, current levels.
In the US the market remains weak, and prompt prices

in the west Corn Belt fell by $15/st following new spring pre-pay prices issued by a major producer last week. While further south, length in the market has pushed prices down to below $300/st fob in Oklahoma.

Uralchem is understood to have some spot availability out of Ventpsils for February/March loading. According to its latest production results, Uralchem’s ammonia output reached 2.978 million tonnes in 2015, up 4pc from 2014. Production of merchant ammonia increased by 6pc and amounted to 825,000 tonnes.

Yuzhny
The Black Sea market was quiet this week with no new spot business reported. There is some considerable tonnage mov- ing to the east of Suez out of Yuzhny this month; Koch’s Clip- per Orion loaded from the port and left yesterday destined for South Korea where it will discharge 9-15,000t for Namhae and the balance cargo for SFC, it is understood. Prior to the Orion, Ameropa loaded 23,000t on the Gas Grouper early this week for delivery to IFFCO, Kandla, and previous to this Ameropa loaded 40,000t on the Clipper Mars at the end of January for delivery to IFFCO, Paradip.
Ameropa has chartered the 25,000t Solaro for 2-3 months and is expected to load the vessel from Yuzhny in 2H Febru- ary.
Poland
Police is understood to still have around 10-12,000t available for end-February loading.
UK
Yara’s Antarcticgas loaded from Hull and left today destined for Yara’s own system in Rostock, Germany.

Saudi Arabia
It is understood that there is no further spot availability out of Saudi Arabia for February, as aside from its recent 23,000t sale to Mitsui, Sabic has this week also swapped a 23,000t cargo with Muntajat due to some production prob- lems at the Qafco facility.
Qatar
Muntajat is reporting steady demand from east and west coast India for February. The Qafco 4 ammonia unit is run- ning at around 70pc of capacity due to technical problems,

and Muntajat has agreed to load a cargo from Saudi Arabia again this month to cover its shortage from the plant. Qafco 4 will most likely be taken down in the next 1-2 weeks for repair work.

South Korea
Namhae has purchased 15,000t of ammonia from Yara for delivery 1-5 March priced at $347/t cfr. In addition, the fer- tilizer producer has bought 9-15,000t from Koch for delivery between 5-10 March. The Koch cargo is expected to be deliv- ered on the Clipper Orion ex-Yuzhny, with the balance cargo being delivered to Samsung Fine Chemicals.
Prior to these cargoes, Namhae is due to receive 9,500t on the Tobolsk tomorrow from Trammo, followed by 8,000t on the Brussels next week, and 6,600t on the Gas Quantum from Mitsui on account of Mitsubishi.
Americas
US
Prices in the west Corn Belt have dropped $15/st in response to a new spring prepay program a major producer released last week. Meanwhile, length in Oklahoma has pressured prices below $300/st fob. Some producers and suppliers are at odds with lower prices and refuse to readjust their spring prepay programs. Looking forward, producers and suppli- ers are cautiously optimistic as urea prices firm slightly, and prospects for UAN demand for the spring look positive.
Taiwan
Taiwan Fertilizer Company will receive the al-Jabirah from Sabic in late- February. The vessel will discharge 17,000t for TFC, and the balance cargo for CPDC under an earlier cfr sale from Sabic to Mitsui.
Indonesia
There are unconfirmed reports that CJ has awarded its tender for 6,000t for delivery in the first half of March to Petrokimia Gresik. The tender closed on 1 February and it is understood that Gresik had offered between $365-370/t cfr.
China
Ammonia producers have been trying to maintain low stocks to reduce risks during the New Year holiday season next week. The mainstream ammonia price is around RMB2,030/t ex-works in Shandong province and around RMB1,900/t ex- works in Hebei province.
World Urea Outlook to 2029

FMB Spot Sales Selection – 4 February 2016
Company news
Mosaic curtails production
Mosaic will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016, the leading US producer said today.
If fully realized, the cuts will represent 14pc of Mosaic's quarterly finished phosphate production capacity. Mosaic produced 2.4mn t of finished phosphates in the third quarter of 2015, representing 83pc of its operational capacity. The company releases fourth quarter and full-year figures on 11 February.
"The long-term positive outlook for phosphates has not
changed, but we are adjusting our production levels to match immediate demand and manage our margins," Mosaic chief executive Joc O'Rourke said.
The company said the curtailment is in response to cur- rent crop nutrient market conditions. Prices for US DAP have been in decline since trading at $420/st fob Nola in late October because of lagging domestic and international demand. By late January, DAP prices hovered around $310/ st fob Nola — a 26pc drop and the lowest level since 2009. Since then the market has improved marginally, with trades last week at $315-$320/st fob Nola.
US DAP export prices have also dropped steadily since September 2015, going from the mid-$450s/t fob Tampa to

$380-$385/t fob as of last week because of decreasing global demand, particular in Brazil and Latin America.
Mosaic's phosphate feedstock costs have dropped sharply as well. The February Tampa ammonia contract fell by $40/t from January to a six-year low of $310/t cfr. The first quarter molten sulphur contract settled down $15/lt to $95/lt deliv- ered to its lowest point since the fourth quarter of 2013.
The prospect of lowered US farm incomes and an unfavor- able outlook for crop prices have many farmers deferring fertilizer orders until the last minute. However, Mosaic believes prices are at a level that will inspire a rebound in demand.
Argus FMB Ammonia Methodology
Argus uses a precise and transparent methodology to assess prices in all the markets it covers. The latest version of the Argus FMB Ammonia Methodology can be found at: www.argusmedia.com/methodology.

"With the recent price volatility and decline in raw mate- rial costs, buyers appear to be delaying purchases. This is lengthening the seasonal period of weak demand," Mosaic senior vice president of commercial operations Rick McLel- lan said. "Today's crop nutrient prices, including phosphates, are attractive to farmers globally and we expect a strong demand response after this seasonally slow period."
