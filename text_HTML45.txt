ANALYSIS
Mosaic cuts production as price collapse continues
Mosaic announced long awaited DAP/MAP production cuts this week as market prices again tumbled on weak demand and high stocks.
The US company plans to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns. With phosphates prices and sentiment collapsing in markets around the world, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best moment for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system. However, many sources think the cut does not go far enough and that it will remain a difficult task for producers to stabilise and possibly raise some DAP/MAP prices by the end of the first quarter.
Mosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market. Without any new sales, the company's DAP/MAP Tampa price is assessed at $350- 360/mt FOB. The US domestic benchmark at New Orleans remained essentially flat week over week.
In the last two weeks more than 100,000 mt of spot MAP/DAP has been committed to the US between EuroChem and PhosAgro. These cargos are in addition to two 50,000 mt MAP/DAP cargos previously booked by Koch with OCP. Another international trader is shopping for Russian phosphates to load in February for the US if enough US buyers will commit to purchases.
The Brazilian MAP market again saw declines this week as Indagro sold off further Saudi Arabian tonnage as low as $325/mt CFR. In the last two weeks, Brazil's MAP import price has reduced by as much as $35/mt. Demand remains slow to build. Brazil's consumption of all P2O5 products in the full year 2015 fell to
4.4million mt from 4.8 million mt in 2014 and imports of MAP to Brazil fell 23% to 2.3 million mt during the year, according to new ANDA data. Most sources suspect that there could be further declines to go in Brazil but that such low levels are likely to encourage buying later in the quarter.
European DAP prices also saw slight reductions this week. Demand for DAP is still slow across the continent and prices are quoted at the reduced level of around $425/mt FCA across northern Europe. EuroChem has sold the final 10,000 mt DAP from Lifosa left for February shipment to northern European markets at around $410/mt FOB while GCT has sold 3,000-4,000 mt DAP to Italy at $420/mt FOB. JPMC and GCT likely each have around 100,000 mt DAP being stockpiled due to weak sales and their prices have reduced again to spur on activity.
In early January, OCP failed to continue to achieve its price goal of $450/mt FOB in Europe. As a result its allocation of DAP for European markets was reduced to 50,000 mt from 80-100,000 mt. The company continues to hold around the same price level and notes that it will manage its DAP allocation to demand and not accept current low prices in Europe. Despite this, the Moroccan DAP price has been indicatively reduced to $420-430/mt FOB due to market levels.
Vast stocks of DAP continue to impact the market in India. There is little import business expected until the end of Q1 when new Nutrient Based Subsidy rates are announced. A 15,000 mt DAP vessel arrived this
week for Blue Deebaj from Chinese producers, which was previously reported at around $390-395/mt CFR and Ma'aden has also confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with February or March shipment. Traders and importers are now assessing DAP prices at $370-380/mt CFR based on global prices after recent reductions in other markets. Current Indian DAP prices are assessed in the $380- 395/mt CFR range with downward pressure.
Export levels from China further reduced this week as the lunar New Year approaches. The Malaysian National Farmer's Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR from a Chinese producer while a Thai buyer is believed to have purchased 15,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer, although this is not confirmed. The Thai buyer had asked for $380/mt CFR. While larger producers have reduced some production and are holding export sales at $390/mt FOB as they await the domestic season, smaller producers in Hubei have had to make export sales as low as $368/mt FOB in order to keep up revenues, which has dragged down export prices.
Despite the weaker price environment, Saudi Arabia's Ma'aden confirmed over 210,000 mt of sales for the coming two months. The shipments include DAP sales to India, Southeast Asia and East Africa, an MAP sale to Australia and mixed DAP/MAP shipments under formula pricing to Brazil and Argentina/Uruguay. Prices for the DAP sales are quoted in the $380-400/mt FOB range. Sabic is currently indicating prices in the $370s/mt FOB and has postponed DAP/MAP availability to the beginning of March due to slow demand.
Mosaic's Q1 cutback seems unlikely to change much in the near term. Global stocks remain high and demand has yet to jump in major markets. Sentiment has reduced significantly in recent weeks leading PhosAgro's chief executive Andrey Guryev to say this week that DAP prices are likely to fall a further 10% in the next few weeks. Suppliers hope that the Mosaic cut, coupled with a return in demand for a range of markets at the end of Q1 can offset the recent price pressure.

Sulphur
There were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February. The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq's $30/mt reduction of its Qatar sulphur price to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its official selling price to $105/mt FOB. Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downwards pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.
Ammonia
Further falls are noted east of Suez as buyers push for values closer to the Tampa February number of $310/mt CFR. Reports of ample supply in the region are helping their cause with suppliers seemingly left with little choice but to concede discounts to stimulate March sales.
Agricultural Developments
Wheat prices moved lower this week, on reduced export demand, but offset by small gains in corn, soybean and rice prices.
Soybean harvest in Brazil has progressed beyond 4% completion, according to Ag Rural. Combine Harvesting in Mato Grosso was seen at 8% complete (11% same time last year). Reported yields have so far been mixed, and the USDA attaché in Brazil this week lowered their soybean production forecast to 98 million mt. This remains a record volume, but below the 100 million mt originally forecast.
Safrinha corn plantings are now over 3% complete in Mato Grosso and Parana. Plantings are expected to be pushed beyond the ideal planting window, which ends February 20. This is due to unprecedented forward sales and current record high prices. This will help to boost nearby farm fertilizer demand, draining some pipeline inventories.
Crop conditions in Argentina have turned dryer over the past two weeks. If this dry period is extended, yields of both soybeans and corn may be impacted, as both crops are in critical development stages.
Rice prices in Thailand increased to a six month high this week. Low water availabilities added some worries to the upcoming cropping season and may be detrimental to fertilizer demand.
Wheat planting in India inched higher through the week, with planted area now 29.3 million hectares, 5% below the same time last year.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US S. Plains: DAP quotes lower due to lack of interest
DAP is not moving from warehouses in the southern US east or west of the Mississippi River yet, but distributors have been tempted to lower posted prices in hopes of attracting demand. At press time, quotes for DAP from warehouses along the Arkansas River were at $355/st, while inland locations south of Mason- Dixon typically were $360/st FOB. The low end of this range is $15/st below last week's postings.
US Tampa: No new exports again
Mosaic is not reporting any new export sales over the past week. Its February 3 announcement of a Q1 production cut indicated it would not participate in recent low indications cited in Brazil's market. Even earlier returns possible from Brazil and other markets in South America suggest a decline in the US export indication to $350-360/mt FOB Tampa.
This week's drop indicates a decline of $20/mt from the prior week at both ends of the range. The move down puts the export price tag roughly in line with bids for March physical positions in the New Orleans barge market.
US NOLA: DAP steady after Mosaic confirms cut
At the start of the week the bid offer spread for prompt DAP barges was reported at $310-315/st FOB New Orleans. By February 4 completed business was reported at $313-326/st FOB New Orleans by traders, as bullish buying overtook bearish sentiments expressed by many traders. In addition, Mosaic claimed a single DAP barge sale at $335/st FOB, creating a $22/st spread for the week.
On average, this week's DAP New Orleans price range is $1.50/st higher than the prior week.
Meanwhile, two more PhosAgro 30-35,000 mt cargos are planned for the US, both believed destined for United Suppliers. EuroChem also is in the freight market to load 50,000 mt of MAP for the US. These vessels are expected to arrive by the end of March.
USA: Mosaic finally announces phosphate cuts
Mosaic finally came through with its expected market related production cut announcement February 3. It said it intends to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns.
Mosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market.
Some traders were disappointed that the company hedged its plans by not committing to the full 400,000 mt of cuts, and instead said only that it would reduce by up to that volume.
Nevertheless, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best time for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system and up to 60 days before field work for most spring planting will be underway. While some further cargos from Morocco and possibly the FSU are expected to arrive in coming weeks, traders probably will not be able to add spot cargos from China to the US import lineup.
US Midwest: Modest demand yields lower prices
Modest phosphate sales volumes are typical in winter, but Midwest distributors have been willing to reflect lower replacement costs for DAP and MAP in recent weeks by cutting resale prices to retailers.
Over the last week, sales prices have slipped about $10/st to as low as $360/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River.
Mexico: DAP/MAP prices fall in new deal
Fertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The shipment is priced on a formula.
The company continues to negotiate one 40,000 mt mixed DAP/MAP/TSP cargo to Chile which is likely to load in early March.
Fertinal's current DAP/MAP price levels are quoted at 370/mt FOB as the company benefits from higher prices in the Australian buying season and as it avoids sales to the low priced Brazilian market.
Mexico: DAP/MAP/TSP exports drop 19% in 2015
Mexico exported 620,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP between January and November against 762,000 mt in the same period in 2014, representing a 19% reduction, according to GTIS.
MAP exports reached 263,000 mt during the period with 105,000 mt to Australia, 76,000 mt to Chile and 58,000 mt to Argentina. DAP exports reached 138,000 mt during the period with 41,000 mt to Argentina, 36,000 mt to Chile, 20,000 mt to Australia and 26,000 mt to Cuba and Ecuador combined.
TSP exports reached 219,000 mt including 93,000 mt to Chile, 90,000 mt to Argentina, 17,000 mt to the US and 16,000 mt to Brazil.
In December, Fertinal is believed to have exported 70,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP, bringing its full year DAP/MAP/TSP exports to almost 700,000 mt, which would be a fall of 13% against the full year 2014.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Colombia: DAP/MAP imports up 7% Jan-Nov
Colombia imported 303,832 mt DAP/MAP between January and November 2015, a 7% increase on the same period 2014, according to GTIS.
Between January and November, Colombia imported 160,120 mt DAP, 12% more than the same period a year earlier. During the 11 months, Colombia imported 134,827 mt from the US, 7% higher than the 125,900 mt in 2014, while Chinese producers increased import volumes to 19,075 mt from 9,281 mt.
Colombia's MAP imports reached 143,172 mt, a slight increase from 140,541 mt in the same period a year ago. US shipments fell to 123,571 mt from 127,983 mt, while imports from China rose to 16,938 mt from just 8,073 mt in 2014.
Brazil: Indagro sells MAP at $325/mt CFR
Indagro is rumoured to have sold a further 5,000 mt Saudi MAP to Fertipar at the reduced price of $325/mt CFR.
The news follows sales late last week from Indagro with Saudi MAP in the $330s/mt CFR. As a result, the Brazilian market is now quoted in the $325-340/mt CFR range.
Some sources believe the sale clears all tonnage on Indagro's recent formula vessel with Saudi Arabian product.
This week, Ma'aden has confirmed a further DAP/MAP cargo to Brazil under formula pricing with February or March shipment.
Recent sales for Latin America to traders or distribution channels by OCP, Saudi producers and PhosAgro have hit the market in another demand glut and Brazilian MAP prices plummeted.
Many suspect that the reduced prices, along with recent news that new credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, should boost demand by the end of the month or into March, which should at least stabilise the current price fall
Brazil: Full year P2O5 consumption down 7.4%
Brazil's consumption of all P2O5 products in the full year 2015 fell to 4.4 million mt from 4.8 million mt in 2014, according to ANDA data.
Imports of MAP to Brazil fell 23% to 2.3 million mt during the year, DAP imports fell to 395,000 mt from 739,000 mt, TSP imports fell to 868,000 mt from 938,000 mt and SSP imports fell to 564,000 mt from 608,000 mt.
Despite the reduced consumption and imports, domestic production of some granular phosphate products increased. MAP production rose 4% to 654,000 mt while SSP production rose 3% to 910,000 mt. However, TSP production fell 6% to 406,000 mt.
Argentina: DAP prices reduce on market prices
Sources from Argentina indicate that the recent collapse in Brazilian MAP prices has in turn reduced the expectations for DAP prices to Latin America.
As a result, the Argentina DAP spot price has been indicatively reduced to $360-370/mt CFR pending new deals.
Ma'aden has confirmed a further 50,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo to Argentina/Uruguay under formula pricing with February or March shipment.
Following the recent change of leadership in Argentina, many sources at FLA Colombia were buoyant that Argentine fertilizer buying will recover over the coming years after declines under the previous leadership.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Prices decline further on new sales
EuroChem sold its 10,000 mt DAP remaining for February shipment from Lifosa to northern European markets.
Last DAP sales to Northern Europe are believed to have been around $410/mt FOB.
There are expectations from some sources that northern European bids may have fallen to as low as $410- 415/mt FCA, but EuroChem is still holding its Lifosa DAP prices at around $410/mt FOB.
The company is planning a turnaround at the Lifosa plant for around three weeks starting in March, which is likely to reduce normal DAP tonnage by 40-50,000 mt.
EuroChem is also believed to have sold a 40,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo from Kingisepp to the US or Latin America but prices are currently unconfirmed.
The sale would leave EuroChem with around 20,000 mt DAP and 60,000 mt MAP remaining from Kingisepp for February shipment.
EuroChem had said it may seek to reduce DAP/MAP production if prices remain depressed in Brazil but the company has yet to make any extra production cuts.
Last week, PhosAgro sold a 24,000 mt DAP cargo to Turkey's Igsas at $390/mt CFR with duty unpaid and likely 270 days credit.
Based on current market prices and the new sales the Baltic/Black Sea DAP spot price has declined to $340-410/mt FOB and the Baltic/Black Sea MAP price has fallen to $330-340/mt FOB.
Russia: PhosAgro CEO sees more falls in fert prices
The current decline in fertilizer prices is likely to continue, likely driving some high-cost Chinese producers out of business, PhosAgro's chief executive officer told REUTERS on February 4.
Prices for phosphate, potash and nitrogen fertilizers are likely to weaken by at least another 10% in the next few weeks, Chief Executive Officer Andrei Guryev said.
High stocks, weaker currencies, lower commodity prices and limited demand in a range of markets have dragged down fertilizer prices, but Guryev said a further fall may push out some Chinese producers, helping to ease those stocks and lift prices later in 2016.
"Sometimes, it is quite positive for the market to drop one level down because that is the only way to find a lift which will take you up," Guryev said.
Prices for DAP may decline by 10% to $320/mt on an FOB basis but would likely recover to around $400/mt FOB later in the year, he added.
PhosAgro increased output by 1 million mt in the last two years to 6.8 million mt and plans to continue growing production.
EUROPE
Europe: DAP market prices reduce slightly
Demand for DAP is still slow in Europe but prices are quoted at the reduced level of around $425/mt FCA across northern Europe. Sources indicate that European buying may build later in Q1.
EuroChem have sold the final 10,000 mt DAP from Lifosa left for February shipment to northern European markets.
In early January, OCP failed to continue to achieve its price goal of $450/mt FOB in Europe. As a result its allocation of DAP for European markets was reduced to 50,000 mt from 80-100,000 mt. The company continues to hold around the same price level and notes that it will manage its DAP allocation to demand and not accept current low prices in Europe.
Despite this, based on current global market DAP prices, the Moroccan spot DAP price has been indicatively reduced to $420-430/mt FOB pending new sales.
GCT and JPMC are offering around $400-420/mt FOB to Europe in February, with GCT confirmed to have sold 3,000-4,000 mt DAP to Italy at $420/mt FOB.
Some sources note that new bids from European buyers have reduced to the $390-410/mt CFR range.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Saudi Arabia: Sabic postpones sales as prices fall
Sabic postponed DAP/MAP availability to the beginning of March as demand remains weak across key markets.
Sabic says its price ideas are now $370-380/mt FOB.
Ma'aden have confirmed a range of shipments for the next two months totalling around 210,000 mt DAP/MAP.
The company has confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with a likely netback of around $385/mt FOB RAK and a 15-20,000 mt DAP sale to East Africa at around $400/mt FOB RAK.
In addition, Ma'aden has agreed a 22,000 mt DAP sale to a Southeast Asian buyer at $390/mt FOB RAK.
The company has two mixed DAP/MAP cargoes to Latin America (one shipment to Brazil and one to Argentina/Uruguay) at formula pricing totalling around 100,000 mt. Ma'aden also has signed a 40,000 mt shipment, likely MAP, to Australia also at formula pricing.
Ma'aden has also signed government-to-government agreements with Bangladesh for granular phosphate shipments in 2016 and plans to start executing sales in the next 1-2 months.
DAP prices are currently assessed at $370-395/mt FOB from Saudi Arabian producers.
Saudi Arabian MAP has recently been sold in Brazil by Indagro in the $325-340/mt CFR range.
Jordan: Sales still slow, indicative prices decline
There are no confirmed new DAP sales from Jordan this week and with market prices falling dramatically, the Jordan export price has also dropped on an indicative basis.
The country exported just 25,000 mt DAP of its 80,000 mt allocation for the combined months of December and January and is likely to now have around 100,000 mt DAP in stock.
JPMC plans to carry out a month-long turnaround at its operations in March.
With indications that new European levels may have slipped below $420/mt CFR and following the news of a Russian cargo to Turkey at $390/mt CFR, the Jordan DAP export price has declined on an indicative basis to $400/mt FOB.
Tunisia: Prices reduce on low demand, high stocks
GCT sold 3-4,000 mt DAP of its February allocation to Italy at around $420/mt FOB, but new offers to these markets are believed to now be around the $400/mt FOB level.
Following recent DAP sales from Russia to Turkey at $390-395/mt CFR, GCT may be offering as low at $380/mt FOB to the Turkish market, although this is not confirmed.
Currently Tunisian prices are assessed in an indicative range of $400-420/mt FOB pending further deals.
GCT sold around 40,000 mt of its 60,000 mt DAP allocation in both December and January. The company is still believed to still be operating at around 60% of its 110,000 mt/month capacity and GCT's DAP stocks are currently quoted at around 100,000 mt.
Morocco: DAP prices hit more pressure
OCP continues to hold DAP prices at $440-450/mt FOB to Europe without any new sales, but the current market has dropped significantly and Moroccan export prices have been decreased to an indicative $420- 430/mt FOB.
Morocco cut its allocation for Europe in January to 50,000 mt from an expectation of 80-100,000 mt after further price declines across the continent. The company is planning for another 80-100,000 mt DAP/MAP sales to Europe in February, but says it will reduce this level again if necessary.
The company's DAP FOB values have likely been boosted by sales to African markets. OCP is aiming for 200-250,000 mt DAP/NPK/NPS shipments to African markets in February, including at least one shipment to Ethiopia, and is looking to sell 25-30,000 mt DAP/NPK into its domestic market.
However, there are indications that European DAP prices have fallen to as low as $390-430/mt CFR and OCP may soon be forced to make sales at further-reduced levels. On the other hand, OCP's strategy may help limit the current price declines before a possible demand return in some markets later in Q1.
OCP also plans to send a further DAP/MAP panamax to the US during February, but there are no February shipments planned to its distribution channel in Brazil without some improvement in consumption.
The Moroccan MAP price has been lowered to $400/mt FOB, but with no recent sales in Europe and Latin American levels indicating a netback around $70/mt below this, the level is likely to decline further.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Pakistan: No activity as Fauji begins production
Fauji has now finished the two-week turnaround at its Port Qasim plant and returned to granular phosphate production.
There are no new reported DAP imports to Pakistan. With higher than normal stocks and the possibility of reduced consumption in Q1, there are unlikely to be significant imports of DAP during the period.
Based on indications from India and recent prices from Pakistan, the DAP price has reduced to an indicative level of $395/mt CFR with further downward pressure.
India: Glut in demand reduces indicated prices
Indian DAP importers are struggling to sell on vast stocks and there is little import business expected until the end of Q1 when new Nutrient Based Subsidy rates are announced.
One 15,000 mt DAP vessel arrived this week from a Chinese producer to Blue Deebaj, which was previously reported at around $390-395/mt CFR, although the price was not confirmed.
Ma'aden has also confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with February or March shipment.
Traders and importers are now assessing DAP prices at $370-380/mt CFR based on global prices after recent reductions in other markets. Current Indian DAP prices are assessed in the $380-395/mt CFR range with downward pressure.
Most companies are expecting the DAP subsidy to be cut in a range of INR 2,000-3,000/mt ($29-44). The government may also force producers/importers to reduce the maximum retail price along with the subsidy reduction.
Many companies have revised DAP MRP's to INR 23,700-23,800/mt since January from INR 23,700- 24,000/mt in order to match with IFFCO's recent price reduction to INR 23,700/mt.
At current MRP levels and exchange rates, DAP importers are believed to have a breakeven level of around $365-375/mt CFR if the subsidy is cut in the range of INR 2,000-3,000/mt. If there is a significant reduction in the MRP as well, this level may reduce by as much as $15-25/mt.
DAP stocks remain at the very high level of 2-2.5 million mt and domestic DAP production levels are returning to normal levels after the recent reduction in phosacid prices. As a result, there are unlikely to be significant DAP imports until at least the end of Q1.
Although unconfirmed, a major domestic tender for 80,000 mt DAP in the Punjab region is believed to have received offers as much as $50/mt below the current import price assessment as suppliers and importers
attempt to clear stocks. As a result, current sentiment is that DAP import prices for India have to reduce further but that even massive price reductions are unlikely to spur on import activity for quite some time.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: FOB levels reduce as Golden Week approaches
New sales from Hubei producers and falls in market DAP prices have reduced the current Chinese FOB levels ahead of next week's New Year holidays.
Chinese producers are believed to have secured sales to Southeast Asia this week. The Malaysian National Farmer's Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR from a Chinese producer while a Thai buyer is believed to have purchased 15,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer, although this is not confirmed. The Thai buyer had asked for $380/mt CFR.
Market DAP prices in India are now indicatively assessed as low as the $380/mt CFR level with downward pressure and little buying activity expected during the first quarter.
As a result, Chinese export DAP prices are assessed in the $368-$378/mt FOB range although many of the larger producers continue to hold levels at around $390/mt FOB and are focusing on the domestic market.
While larger producers have reduced some production and are holding export sales as they await the domestic season, smaller producers in Hubei have had to make export sales in a time of little demand in order to keep up revenues, which has dragged down export prices.
The domestic market for DAP remains slow and has now effectively stopped with all of the transport systems in use for mass migration during the Chinese New Year holidays.
Despite this, domestic prices remain stable on a price guarantee basis this week and most sources expect that the domestic market will see at least a month's worth of strong buying activity after the New Year, keeping much of the Chinese DAP out of export markets until around April.
Regarding MAP, Chinese producers have managed to keep up some export sales to the ongoing seasonal buying in Australia but there are no new exports to Brazil. Chinese producers have no current plans to send to Brazil as current market prices are too low compared to their domestic market or the Australian sales.
The domestic MAP market also remains largely inactive with many NPK plants already announcing that they have completed their sourcing of raw materials for upcoming production after the Chinese holidays. Activity should increase following the New Year.
Australia: MAP prices quoted relatively high
Indications from the Australian MAP market imply that prices in the on-going buying season are currently at significantly better netbacks to suppliers than the weak levels seen in Brazil.
China's Wengfu and YTH are believed to still be sending MAP to their distribution channels in Australia and sources quote prices for MAP at around $390/mt CFR.
Mexico's Fertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The cargo is priced on a formula.
High competition is reportedly taking place for sales in Australia, with more Chinese producers recently achieving Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) recognition, adding to the number of companies accepted to export granular phosphates to Australia.
As a result, other countries which export to Australia, such as Mexico and Saudi Arabia, are expected to have lost market share to Chinese producers during the season.
Regarding exports, there are no new sales reported from Australia's Incitec Pivot but with new price ideas reducing across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, export DAP prices have reduced on an indicative basis to $370-380/mt FOB.
Southeast Asia: Nafas gets DAP in $380s/mt CFR
The Malaysian National Farmer’s Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR.
The DAP is believed to be of Chinese origin and is likely to be for prompt shipment, although this is not confirmed.
It is unclear whether the 15,000 mt DAP asked for by a Thai buyer last week has been purchased. The buyer asked for $380/mt CFR. A Thai buyer recently purchased 10,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer at $388/mt CFR.
In addition, Ma'aden has agreed a 22,000 mt DAP sale to a Southeast Asian buyer at $390/mt FOB RAK or around $400/mt CFR with February or March shipment. Further details were not available at press time.
Philippines: DAP/NPK imports rise on Philphos closure
The Philippines imported 90,000 mt DAP between January and October 2015, an increase from 54,000 mt on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. The vast majority of the DAP came from Chinese producers.
The country also imported 145,168 mt NPKs during the ten months of 2015, a decline of 8% from 159,124 mt previously. Of this volume, 47,404 mt NPKs were shipped from Vietnamese producers, 30,000 mt from Yara, 26,738 from Namhae.
Imports of NP products also rose to 107,776 mt from 70,310 mt previously, including 104,838 mt from Chinese producers.
The Philippines did not export any DAP/NPK/NPs in 2015.
Philippines producer Philphos remains out of action after damage caused by Cyclone Haiyan in November 2013. According to Filipino news agency InterAksyon the plant's machinery remains intact and its granulation plant is back in working condition, but Philphos is not believed to have purchased raw material for production at this point.
Recent news reports have suggested that Philphos has struggled to collect insurance for the damage and may have defaulted on some of its interest and principal payments since the supertyphoon.
New Zealand: DAP and Rock imports decline
New Zealand's DAP imports during 2015 reached 238,000 mt, a 20% decline on 297,000 mt previously, according to GTIS.
Chinese DAP shipments increased to 183,000 mt from 151,000 mt, increasing its market share to 77% from 51% in 2014. US producers increased DAP shipments to 46,000 mt from zero but shipments from Incitec Pivot in Australia fell to 7,000 mt from 59,000 mt in 2014.
Phosphate rock imports also declined 10% to 638,000 mt from 712,000 mt in 2014. South Africa shipped 67,000 mt compared with 63,000 mt previously, while Vietnam loaded 58,000 mt against 65,000 mt, Jordan
failed to send any rock to New Zealand after sending 59,000 mt in 2014. OCP increased its New Zealand rock sales to 440,000 mt from 398,000 mt.
Japan: China increases DAP shipments in 2015
Japan imported 367,000 mt DAP in 2015, a 2.3% increase from 359,000 mt during 2014, according to customs data via GTIS.
Chinese producers increased shipments to Japan by 25% to 197,000 mt in 2015, while US producers loaded 130,000 mt, down from 154,000 mt the previous year.
Saudi, Moroccan and Jordanian producers reduced total shipments to Japan to 40,000 mt DAP from 47,000 mt previously.
Japan's phosphate rock imports reached 293,000 mt in 2015, a fall from 313,000 mt in 2014. During the period, OCP shipped 53,000 mt rock, Chinese producers 72,000 mt, South Africa loaded 70,000 mt, Jordan 53,000 mt, Nauru 20,000 mt and Vietnam shipped 21,000 mt.
Japanese NPK imports in 2015 are seen at the lowest level since 1994 at 76,907 mt. A 35% fall from 117,545 mt in 2014.
NPK imports from South Korean producers fell to 32,138 mt from 60,485 mt an almost 50% decline. Imports from China declined to 25,770 mt from 27,784 mt and imports from Yara fell by 500 mt.
TSP
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Market’s TSP indications fall
In response to both reduced MAP prices in Brazil and lower TSP prices in other markets like Europe, TSP prices on an indicative basis to Brazil have reduced.
Currently TSP is quoted by sources in the $300-320/mt CFR Brazil range but there have been no recent deals.
Consumption for SSP was largely flat during 2015 in Brazil but TSP levels are said to have fallen significantly. According to ANDA, TSP imports fell to 868,000 mt in full year 2015 from 938,000 mt previously while TSP production fell 6% to 406,000 mt.
PHOSPHORIC ACID
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Plans advance for phosphate complexes
Egypt is advancing plans to develop its phosphates sector with two major new complexes, the first of which is scheduled to begin construction this month.
Both projects are driven by a government shift away from exporting raw materials and a new focus on the increased value of downstream products.
The El Wady complex, the least advanced of the two projects, is due to be incorporated in the coming weeks after completing its pre-feasibility study last year. The joint venture between Misr Phosphate and Abu Qir and will be constructed in two phases, with the first to focus on the production of phosphoric acid.
About 3.1 million mt of rock is required and "secured at preferential prices," according to the prospectus. The project "will be heavily supported by the Egyptian government".
Production of 518,000 mt/year phosphoric acid (MGA) is planned for Phase 1, all for export. Part of the phosacid production will be used in Phase 2 to produce 345,000 mt/year DAP/MAP, with the rest (about 207,000 mt P2O5 exported). Phase 3 is production of about 345,000 mt/year TSP.
The investment cost is estimated at $1.05 billion and strategic investors are now being sought, with the project's sponsors aiming to retain a 40% stake.
In November President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi approved the construction of El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals' phosphate and compound fertilizers complex at Ain Sokhna.
It will produce DAP, MAP, TSP, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid (see FERTILIZER WEEK on January 16, 2015), with the fertilizers destined for the domestic market with surplus production available for export. Construction will be compressed into 30 months, El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals said in Cairo this week.
South Africa: Phosphoric acid exports plunge
South Africa exported just 147,000 mt phosphoric acid in 2015, a decline from 281,000 mt in 2014 and 431,000 mt in 2013, according to GTIS data.
During the period, South Africa's phosphoric acid exports to India were just 63,000 mt, a slight fall from 66,000 mt in 2014 and a 74% decline on the 2013 figures. In addition, sales to Turkey, Netherlands and the UAE combined declined 69% against 2014 to just 22,000 mt.
Foskor's South African plant has suffered a series of technical issues, power shortages and most recently strike action, all of which have combined to lower operating rates and cut into export availability.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Acid shipments reach 328,000 mt in January
Phosphoric acid shipments to India reached 328,000 mt P2O5 solution in January according to port data, bringing full fertilizer-year shipments to 2.6 million mt solution.
For February, the country already has 104,000 mt P2O5 solution set for delivery, including at least 20,000 mt from JPMC and 48,000 mt from OCP, port data show.
Bangladesh: BCIC announces Phosacid tender
Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corp (BCIC) has announced a tender to buy 10,000 mt +/- 10% phosphoric acid solution (52-54% P2O5), closing on March 8.
Shipment of the phosphoric acid should take place within 30 days from the receipt of L/C to BCIC's TSP jetty in Chittagong.
BCIC recently received offers on its tender for 10,000 mt +/- 10% phosphoric acid solution (52-54% P2O5) which closed on January 20. It is unclear whether the new tender is considered a retender.
PHOSPHATE ROCK

Peru: Vale's rock prices under negotiation
Phoshate rock producer Vale is yet to complete its negotiations for new phosphate rock contracts from Peru.
The company is negotiating contracts to its regular buyers in India, Southeast Asia and other markets. It is expected to complete negotiations by the end of February.
Other rock suppliers, including OCP and some Egyptian companies, have reduced their rock prices by around $10/mt depending on grade and Vale is widely expected to accept a similar reduction.
Vale's current price for its 66.5% BPL rock is around $90/mt FOB depending on the market.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Misr Phosphate expands mining with three sites
Misr Phosphate is now operating three phosphate rock mines in Egypt, and recently began work at a new site.
Alongside production estimated at about 2 million mt/year for Abu-Tartour, the government-owned entity began operations at El Sibiya site close to the Red Sea two months ago, with its first shipment due to load out of Safaga.
El Sibiya produces 27-30% P2O5 rock, as well as 24-25% P2O5, Misr Phosphate said in Cairo.
The company also resumed operations at the Red Sea Mine, which produces higher-grade 30-32% P2O5 ore. There are said to be 500 workers on site and production estimates vary from 15,000 mt a month currently to about 40,000 mt.
Misr Phosphate receives only a small percentage of revenue for managing operations at the Red Sea mine but hopes to be awarded outright control in the near future.
Combined production from the three mines is estimated by the company to reach about 3 million mt/year.
Misr Phosphate and El Nasr Mining are still considering price-coordination to establish a single FOB price for each grade of rock exported from Egypt. The idea is understood to be encountering resistance from traders.
Jordan: Q1 rock contracts settle $10-13/mt lower
Jordan's JPMC has now settled most of its phosphate rock contracts with customers for the first quarter at a $10-13/mt decrease from prices in the second half of 2015, the producer said.
In India, buyers of Jordan's higher-grade rock (73-75% BPL) will pay about $120/mt FOB in Q1 with consumers in Indonesia and Japan paying as much as $125/mt FOB.
Lower-grade rock for the Indian market (68-72% BPL) was settled at around $110/mt FOB, with buyers outside India paying around $115/mt FOB. JPMC is still believed to be negotiating some final deals with Indian customers.
As a result of the new contracts and after recent news that OCP concluded its 72% BPL contract price at $130-140/mt FOB, the India (71-75% BPL) Spot/Contract price is now assessed at $126-152/mt CFR pending any further contracts.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Rock shipments pass 500,000 mt in January
Phosphate rock shipments to India reached 526,000 mt in January according to port data, bringing full fertilizer-year rock shipments to 6.9 million mt.
For February, the country already has 238,000 mt rock set for delivery, port data show. The February tonnage includes two shipments from OCP totalling 107,000 mt, two shipments from JPMC totalling 88,000 mt and one shipment of 44,000 mt from Algeria.

Kenya: KTDA seeks 67,587 mt NPKs for 2016
The Kenya Tea Development Agency is seeking 67,587 mt NPK 26-5-5 for 2016 and is pre-qualifying suppliers as part of a two-phase tender process, according to the agency's website.
Companies seeking prequalification must submit technical proposals by February 23, 2016.
KTDA last April bought 70,000 mt Uralchem product from Mekatrade at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.

OCP aims for energy independence by 2020
Moroccan phosphates giant OCP plans to boost investments in renewable energy as it looks to achieve energy independence by 2020, according to news agency SEENEWS.
The company is targeting a generation capacity of 600 megawatts by 2020 by investments in wind, solar and hydro energy along with cogeneration, the Moroccan Energy Minister Abdelkader Amara said at a mining conference last week.
Since 2010, OCP has raised co-generation capacity to 350 megawatts, which covered 60% of their electricity needs in 2015.
The news comes as King Mohammed VI inaugurated the company's JPH-1 fertilizer production hub, which is dedicated to African markets. Production at the site started at the end of 2015.
The plant is part of OCP's ambitious strategy to increase fertilizer production to 12 million mt by 2017 with a second hub set to come online by the end of Q2 2016.
LEGISLATION
Brazil receives early farm credit boost
The Brazilian government, in conjunction with Banco do Brasil (Bank of Brazil), have announced that BRL 10 billion ($2.51 billion) in credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, according to consultancy 'The Soybean and Corn Advisor'.
This early announcement of credit follows complaints in 2015, when credit was not available until May/June, significantly cutting farm budgets and fertilizer demand.
Small to medium sized farmers can receive loans for input purchasing through the National Programme to Help Medium-Sized Rural Producers (PRONAMP). Loans for BRL 710,000 ($180,000) have an interest rate of 7.75% and loans of BRL 1,200,000 ($304,350) see a rate of 8.75%. These rates are unchanged from 2015 and are significantly below free market interest rates, which are thought to be over 20%.
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
Pemex finalises Fertinal takeover
Pemex has completed its acquisition of Fertinal in Mexico, with longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Fabio Covarrubias of the phosphate producer confirming he has handed over control this week.
In a letter to Fertinal employees, Covarrubias said government controlled petrochemical giant Pemex was in a position to make the phosphate operation on Mexico’s west coast more vertically integrated thanks to Pemex’s ammonia capacity. This in turn should move Fertinal back into the list of low-cost phosphate
producers, he said.
The takeover will cost Pemex around $680-690 million, according to Mexican media reports.
The sale of Fertinal has been a subject of industry speculation for much of the last two decades. Ultimately this deal may prove to be more of a signal about Pemex's intentions for its nitrogen assets than anything else.
Pemex controls Petroquimica Cosoleacaque, with nearly 900,000 mt ammonia capacity on Mexico's east coast, although the units do not run at capacity. The lack of competitive ammonia freight to Mexico's west coast versus competing supplies from Trinidad and Venezuela mean the Pemex subsidiaries are not in a position to routinely supply Fertinal.
However, now that Pemex owns Fertinal it should be be easier to arbitrage deliveries to the west coast, as a way to reduce costs of delivering ammonia to the DAP, MAP and TSP producer.
PRODUCTION
PhosAgro fertilizer production increases 10%
Russian producer PhosAgro increased its total fertilizer production by 10.4% to 6.8 million mt in 2015, the company reports.
Despite a fall in commodity prices during 2015, phosphate-based fertilizer and MCP feed phosphates production rose by 12% during the period to 5.4 million mt.
PhosAgro's DAP/MAP production rose 12% to 2.6 million mt while NPK production increased 11% to 1.9 million mt. NPS production rose 10% to 272,800 mt.
Separately, phosphate rock production rose 4.7% to 7.9 million mt while phosphoric acid production as a feedstock increased 9.3% to 2.1 million mt.
Regarding nitrogen output, AN production rose 56% to 455,300 mt and urea production rose 1.3% to 978,000 mt. Ammonia production for feedstock use declined 5.8% to 1.1 million mt.
Overall sales volumes for phosphate-based fertilizers and MCP rose by 12% to 5.3 million mt but sales volumes of nitrogen-based fertilizers fell 1.4% to 1.4 million mt.
Despite some issues with demand at the start of 2015 in the Russian domestic market, PhosAgro still managed to have flat sales volumes to the domestic market during the year at 1.6 million mt of fertilizer. The company is optimistic that government support for agricultural production in Russia could boost sales in 2016.
Regarding exports, the company increased its overall fertilizer sales to Europe by over 30% to 1.3 million mt and hopes to achieve further sales in 2016. Sales to India increased dramatically, partly as a result of PhosAgro's new contract to IPL for NPK and DAP.
However, sales to the Latin American markets reduced due to low soybean prices and economic challenges facing the region.
