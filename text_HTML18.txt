Outlook: Stable
The international market is now feeling the effects of weakening demand and the promise of increased supply with Brazil cfr values and offers from the Middle East falling this week. Demand for rice and top dress continue to fuel stable or rising prices in the US, but lower seasonal consumption and opportunistic imports could soon weigh on prices.

Fundamentals
Agriculture
Weather: The Corn Belt saw light to moderate rainfall this week, though storms were not severe enough to cause any major field delays. Nebraska was the only state to see steady precipitation throughout the week, as rainfall largely dis- sipated by mid-week across the country.
There is a moderate chance of rain across the entire Corn Belt and down to Texas in the 6-10 day forecast, includ- ing severe thunderstorms in the plains, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The wet weather will not last long, however, with precipita- tion chances lessening in the eastern Corn Belt and southern states in the 8-14 day forecast. Temperatures are expected to be higher than usual and lower Corn Belt, especially in the Mississippi Delta, which should bode well for harvesting.
Crop progress: While US crop progress was mostly in line with previous weeks, some areas are still dealing with issues stemming from heavy storms and floods several weeks ago. Areas near the Arkansas river have been particularly af- fected by flooding, with the state seeking federal assistance for 37 counties. Texas and Oklahoma, which saw the wet- test months in state history in May, are also behind five-year average for wheat and oat harvesting, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Overall, US crop condition has shown little impact from the heavy storms. Winter wheat condition – the biggest area of concern – was rated 30pc good or excellent and 20pc of the crop rated poor or very poor. The inclement weather did delay harvests for winter wheat, which is 4pc finished, eight percentage points down from the five-year average. But late- season rains could prove beneficial for wheat long term, with
Average US grain rail metrics, 4 Apr 15 to 29 May 1
production expected to rise 95mn bushels year-on-year to 2.1bn bushels this year, according to the USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE).
Corn conditions were stable at 74pc good or excellent, unchanged from last week. US corn was also 91pc emerged, up slightly from the five-year average of 90pc. Total US corn supply is expected climb to 15.5bn bushels in 2015, up 59mn bushels from last year, on higher beginning stocks, according to the WASDE. Soybean plantings were 79pc finished, two percentage points behind the average. The overall percent-
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
age has been weighed down by Kansas and Missouri, which are 45 percentage points and 39 percentage points behind their respective averages. Annual soybean production is forecast to fall 119mn bushels to 3.9mn bushels.
Crop prices: Front-month wheat futures prices quickly changed sentiment this week on the heels on the WASDE release. Prices had reach a peak of $5.37/bushel on weather concerns, but fell as much as 21¢/bushel in midday trading when the report was released 10 June. Prices continued to fall afterward, settling 11 June at $5.04/bushel.
Front-month corn prices had a less exaggerated reaction to the WASDE and were seemingly unaffected by surging ethanol production (see News Section). July prices fell 10¢/ bushel in midday trading 10 June and settling 11 June at $3.56/bushel. December corn prices also fell slightly on the report, dropping 7¢/bushel week-on-week to settle 11 June at $3.74/bushel.
Front-month soybean prices were the most stable, falling just 4¢/bushels week-on-week to settle 11 June at $9.40/ bushel. November soybeans prices had a more bearish reaction the WASDE, falling 13¢/bushel in midday trading 10 June. The November contract settled 11 June at $9.08/ bushel, a 16¢/bushel drop from last week.
Feedstock
US natural gas futures ended lower as traders sold off some contracts following a report showing a large build in US stockpiles. Nymex gas for July delivery fell by 6.6¢/mmBtu, or 2.3pc, to settle at $2.825/mmBtu.
Prompt-month prices had moved up by 12pc since hitting a five-week settlement low at the end of last week. That sharp increase on forecasts for hotter weather spurred some traders, who had bet on rising prices, to sell off contracts and take profits.
US natural gas inventories should end the injection season at near-record levels amid higher gas production, despite warmer summer weather and increased gas use by the power generation sector.
Stockpiles will reach 3.912 Tcf (111bn m³) ahead of the 1 November start of the heating season, the US Energy Infor- mation Administration (EIA) said in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. At that level, inventories would be 115 Bcf higher than the five-year-average, end-of-season level and just 17 Bcf shy of the all-time high of 3.929 Tcf set on 2 November 2012.
Ammonia margin vs natural gas
Henry Hub (left scale) $/mnBtu
Ammonia producer margin (right scale) $/st
US stockpiles have increased rapidly this year because of a surge in domestic production. Marketed natural gas output, which excludes production losses, hit a record high in De- cember 2014 of 79.19 Bcf/d, up by 13pc from a year earlier, as producers continued to tap gas-rich formations such as the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia and south Texas' Eagle Ford shale.
Marketed production declined slightly in the subsequent months as cold weather shuttered some wells. But initial data for April and May indicate that production growth resumed and output in July should top the record high in December, the EIA said.
Henry Hub spot prices in 2015 should average $3.06/mmBtu, down from a year-earlier average of $4.52/mmBtu, the EIA said. Electric utilities are expected to use low-cost gas gen- eration this year as a substitute for some coal-fired power to meet electricity demand.
Freight
Logistics problems are firming fertilizer barge rates as opera- tors struggle to catch up on shipments delayed by weather and operational difficulties. Normally rates are flat to lower in summer.
High water on the Arkansas river has kept barges off that waterway. Delayed fertilizer shipments are not expected to reach hubs on the upper part of the Arkansas until the first week of July despite improving conditions.
Limited barge operations resumed yesterday on the river, more than four weeks after traffic stopped because of the high water. But efforts to restart traffic are focusing on moving southbound barges off the waterway to make room

for northbound barges parked in Rosedale and bring towing power south on the river.
Flood levels on the Arkansas were the highest in 25 years, according to the National Climatic Data Center. River flows peaked above 350,000 cf/s three times, the US Army Corps of Engineers said. Normal flows for this time of year range from 30,000-50,0000 cf/s. The corps projects flows of 44,000-77,000 cf/s by the first full week in July.
On the Arkansas, rates for destinations between Pine Bluff
and Little Rock have jumped because water levels are lower in that area, causing operators to focus deliveries there first. Rates increased to $14.50-16.50/st from $13.50-14.50/st a week earlier.
Shipments to the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers have been delayed by logistics problems in the St Louis area.
Operations have slowed since 116 barges broke away from their moorings on 30 May, causing the US Coast Guard to temporarily close the upper Mississippi. The barges were recovered later that same day but sorting the equipment into the correct designated fleeting areas has taken time, particularly as operators are delivering new barges to St Louis at the same time. And high water in the St Louis area is limiting night-time shipments for barge tows greater than 600ft in length.
Rates for loadings in the first half of July have increased because of these problems. On the Mississippi, barges for St Louis rose to $9-10.75/st from $9-10/st last week.
Nitrogen
Strong rice and corn top-dress demand led to a surge in prompt urea prices this week, while also pulling up first-half July values. Rice demand is expected to support urea prices through the end of June. Other nitrogen products trended flat-to-lower this week as prices transition to summer reset levels.
Urea (g)
With rice demand in full swing, suppliers scrambled this week to secure prompt/loaded urea barges, causing a sharp rise in prices.

up from business last week at $305/st fob for that loading window.
Trades for barges loading within 30 days spanned a wide
$309-370/st fob Nola range—the largest low/high difference for the Nola assessment since 17 July 2014. Trading focused primarily on two loading periods: prompt/loaded and first- half July.
Prompt/loaded barges traded multiple times at $355/st fob Nola before climbing late-week as high as $370/st fob Nola. The high end of this week’s business represents the highest point for the assessment since July 2014 and marks a $94/st rise in prices over the last two months.
Prices for June-loading barges rose sharply over the course of the week, going from $329/st fob Nola to $355/st fob Nola. First-half July trades ranged from $309-315/st fob Nola,
The firming US market attracted additional June/July spot cargoes to Nola. Ameropa diverted 35,000t ex-Kuwait from Brazil to the US, while Koch declared a 35,000t June ves- sel from Oman for the US Gulf. Indagro has 27,500t on the Servet Ana from Algeria expected to arrive in late June/ early July. OCI also has 25,000t loading in Egypt beginning 15 June.
Urea warehouse prices also firmed this week, particularly in Inola/Catoosa, where the closure of the Arkansas river has sent prices above $400/st fot on increasingly thin supply. Sales were concluded from $400-415/st fot in that market this week, nearly a $100/st rise from early April. Some estimate stocks could be fully depleted in that market by next week.

All freight points are priced from origin of mile 90-184 of Lower Mississippi River
the Arkansas river (see Freight section), with resupply not expected to reach Inola/Catoosa until the end of June at the earliest. The price surge is expected to be temporary, with July loading urea offers at $350/st fot.
The scarcity of urea in Inola/Catoosa has sent suppliers look- ing for tons from other markets and pulled up prices accord- ingly. St Louis sales ranged from $370-380/st fot this week, up from $360-365/st last week.
Cincinnati/Jeffersonville and Twin Cities offers both rose to $370-375/st fot, but saw less activity than farther south markets.
Urea (p)
Prompt prilled urea business has been limited following feed grade barge business netting back to about $300/st fob Nola two weeks ago. This week, late-July feed grade barges traded from $310-312/st fob Nola.
Melt grade prills last traded at $275-280/st fob Nola.
International urea highlights
In India, preliminary urea sales figures for May stand at
2.5mn t, an increase of 304,000t year-over-year. This fol- lows April, which saw a year-over-year increase of 541,000t. Indian stocks are estimated to have dropped to 425,000t at the end of May, about half the May 2014 total.
In Algeria, Sorfert restarted production at its Arzew complex on 6 June. The ammonia and urea units had been down since 17 May. Sorfert will load 3,000t granular urea for Helm, but larger sold cargoes will take more time as production ramps up. The AOA plant this week finished loading 30,000t granular urea for Ameropa destined for the Americas.
Keytrade is in the freight market for 35,000-40,000t of granular urea to load prompt in Oman for shipment to Nola, Brazil or Thailand.
UAN
Following east coast business as low as $216/t cfr and early business for Nola fill tons at $205/st fob Nola, prices in the US UAN market have stabilized and even moved higher.

export business at significantly lower values, is expected to announce fill pricing at this level or higher over the next month. Trader opinions on the fill price are highly varied.
New business has concluded for imports at $235/t cfr to two ports on the east coast for late-July or early-August arrival. That level is up just over $10/t from the last reported east coast business.
Offers for east coast imports have moved to $237/t cfr, but buyers’ price ideas have fallen back to the low-$230s/t cfr.
River terminals continue to drift lower as side dress season wraps up with prices in the range of $280-295/st fot. Those numbers are still well above prices implied by fill values, which are closer to $255/st fot.
Reports indicate a Corn Belt UAN producer has issued a fill program at $245/st fot for loading in July through December.
Ammonium nitrate (p)
Prices are weakening in the AN market because of supply on the river and sputtering demand. Price indications this week moved to $260-265/st fob Nola, down by $8/st from last week. Buying interest is limited because of seasonality as well as fewer suppliers seeking to carry the product because of regulatory and safety concerns.
The Nola AN assessment is at its lowest level on a midpoint basis since it launched in July 2012, beating the prior low of $267.50/st fob seen in November 2013. AN barge prices have dropped by more than $40/st since January 2015.
Prices in Tampa and the Mid South also fell this week to $330-340/st fot. Latest Inola/Catoosa prices are heard at $325/st fot.
with some expecting flat prices to persist because of supply tightness.
US exports of ammonium sulfate continue to trail last year's pace, led by a fall in shipments from the Texas coast. The US exported 50,816t of amsul via vessel in April, down 39pc from a year ago and bringing the fertilizer year-to-date total to 837,412t, a 19pc fall year-over-year, according to customs data.
Amsul exports from Houston and Galveston, Texas, have been sharply lower this year, likely owing to Rentech Nitro- gen's decision to focus less on exports and more on domestic sales from its Pasadena, Texas, plant. Exports from Texas ports for the fertilizer year-to-date are 211,939t, a 44pc drop from the same time last year. Texas ports exported just 6,600t of amsul in April, all of which went to Colombia.
Exports from ports near Honeywell's Hopewell, Virginia, plant — the US' largest with an estimated capacity of 1.8mn st/yr — have also dropped. Combined exports from Hopewell and nearby Norfolk, Virginia, are down 7pc year-over-year to 589,170t for the fertilizer year-to-date. In April, those ports exported 43,559t, with 20,754t to Senegal, 11,000t to Peru, 7,150t to the Dominican Republic and smaller lots to Brazil and Jamaica.
US imports since last July have risen, but domestic produc- tion issues at several facilities and increased agronomic demand for amsul has kept supplies tight in 2015. The US has imported 389,283t of amsul from July-April, a 27pc increase year-over-year, with the total nearly an even split between China and Canada.
The US imported 46,230t of amsul in April with 26,717t from China and 18,767t from Canada. Of the Chinese tonnage, 21,665t went to Vancouver, Washington, with 5,000t to New Orleans. For the fertilizer year-to-date, New Orleans has imported 112,319t of Chinese amsul, while Washington ports have received 86,877t.
US net exports for the fertilizer year-to-date stand at 448,129t, nearly 300,000t lower year-over-year.
Ammonium sulfate (g)
Corn Belt amsul prices are stable at $310-320/st fot with tight supply preventing any moves down toward potential summer fill levels. Speculation over summer fill prices, which traditionally are lower than peak spring levels, varies,
Ammonia

summer, so price declines have been measured. There were, however, some reports of more aggressive offers this week, though there were likely limited volumes concluded at these price levels.
The most notable declines were at Oklahoma production points. One producer dropped offers to as low as $470/ st fot, down from about $525/st fot just last week. Other production sites held offers closer to $500/st fot. Although offers were significantly lower than last week, consensus among traders is that limited tons were sold at these values.
The range of offers in the west Corn Belt has moved lower and widened. Asking prices are still as high as $595/st fot in northeast Iowa but have fallen to as low as $525/st near the Iowa-Nebraska border. Further sidedress consumption in that area is expected to be limited with most of these applica- tions done with UAN.
Higher numbers in the east Corn Belt have receded, with prevailing offers now in the range of $600-620/st. Offers are higher moving east, with limited business done at $620/st fot in Indiana.
Some of the crop, particularly in the east Corn Belt, has only now reached the emergence stage, which should bode well for further summer consumption. At least one supplier has recently moved new tons to East Corn Belt terminals via barge.

Phosphate
Minimal activity marked the US phosphate market this week, with spring demand having ended, save for some pockets in southern areas.
DAP prices are mostly flat, with June barge business con- cluding this week at $420/st fob Nola, down by $3/st from trades last week. The paper market suggests that DAP Nola prices are near a floor, despite the imminent summer fill season, which typically coincides with a move lower in prices to stimulate demand ahead of the fall application season. Nola’s discount relative to other global markets makes a rush of imports unlikely over coming months, creating the percep- tion of limited downside price risk. Third quarter paper bids and offers continue to hover around the $420/st fob Nola.
Producer offers for physical June/July DAP barges continue to be indicated from $425-430/st fob Nola, but buying inter- est is minimal. Mosaic reported continued truck sales in Central Florida at $430/st fot.
In imports, Morocco’s OCP plans to ship at least one cargo to the US in July, with additional vessels possible if there is a delay in the settlement of the third quarter phosphoric acid price.

roccan asking prices. Moroccan offers into Brazil range from $505-515/t cfr, depending on port, while Nola prices equate to the high-$460s/t cfr.
Mosaic reported small lots of export business for July ship- ment this week within the prevailing $471-475t fob Tampa range.
DAP/MAP
The US phosphate market traded thinly this week, with a pair of June-loading domestic DAP barges selling at $420/st fob Nola accounting for all confirmed business. The DAP Nola assessment is adjusted to $418-420/st fob, down by $3/st on the high end. There were no confirmed MAP barge trades, but that product remains widely discussed at a $5-10/st pre- mium to DAP. The MAP assessment is lowered to $425-430/st fob Nola as a result.
Phosphate warehouse prices crept downward this week on flagging demand, with offers now standing at $450-455/st fot in St Louis, Cincinnati/Jeffersonville and Twin Cities. The Inola/Catoosa DAP assessment is unchanged at $460-465/st fot, with suppliers there not motivated to lower offers given fresh supply cannot reach that market until the Arkansas river reopens fully to navigation (see Freight section). MAP warehouse assessments remain at a $5/st premium to DAP.
Brazil imports latest
Brazilian MAP imports fell by a third in the first five months of this year, according to latest GTIS statistics, as poor farmer economics, a weak Real and high inventories from the fourth quarter continued to take their toll. However, May imports have rallied strongly as the season approaches.
Imports of MAP in May hit 263,003t, up nearly 170,000t on the previous month, following a buying spree and price ap- preciation in April.

Of the total, 102,936t were sourced from Russia, through direct sales and via traders. Chinese MAP accounted for 65,511t, with US material recording 56,373t.
Year-to-date imports have reached 709,228t, down 33.5pc. Russia formed the largest share at 254,868t, down a third on the same period of 2014. The US was second with 168,688t, up 7.4pc. OCP Morocco's decision to switch away from Brazil in the first quarter is still reflected in the numbers, with only 114,874t moved, down 61.7pc. China accounted for 109,403t, up 6.3pc.
DAP imports for the calendar year to date are down by slightly less at 239,706t, a fall of 25.6pc. The US has been the largest supplier with 149,931t, down 32.5pc year-on-year. Russia is some way behind in second with 35,525t. Saudi

The company is evaluating the dam- age. The facility produces 600,000 t/yr TSP as well as SSP. The US has imported 49,430t of TSP from Israel over the first four months of 2015 and imported 107,425t for all of 2014.
Potash
The US potash barge market weakened this week as prices move lower in advance of summer fill pricing.
Multiple domestic potash barges traded from $315-320/st fob Nola, with one wholesaler seeing decent retail demand at the high end of that range. Other suppliers indicated offers from $320-325/st fob Nola. Overall buying interest remains limited as the market transitions to the summer fill period, with nearby demand largely confined to the Delta and mid- south, where planting activities are ongoing.
The Nola barge assessment is nearing its lowest level since it launched in July 2012. The assessment’s midpoint reached $311-312/st fob Nola in January 2014 before rallying by more than $60/st over the next eight months.
Corn Belt prices are largely unchanged on stagnant demand. The low end of the Corn Belt assessment is adjusted slightly down to $360-375/st fot. A move lower could be in the cards with Nola barges trading at $315/st fob Nola, which suggests
Corn Belt terminal prices near $350/st fot, depending on exact location.
Buyers have identified that the $350/st fot Corn Belt level could be a price that inspires summer fill demand. Domes- tic producers have yet to come out with official summer pricing. Expectations are for new prices to be unveiled by early July. Until then, producers are focused on replenishing inland warehouses and building consignment stocks ahead of fill demand. Rail volumes for potash over the last month have been higher than historical averages, according to one shipper.
International potash highlights
In Brazil, June business for granular MOP continues to conclude at $330-335/t cfr with forward values showing strength. Producer offers for July deliveries stand at $340/t cfr, with August pegged at $350/t cfr, nearly in line with current Nola values.
In Israel, ICL is focused on loading 50,000t vessels of standard MOP to fulfill its supply contracts, with Chinese customers following the recent resolution of the strike at its Dead Sea Works operations. Standard MOP shipments were able to resume immediately because of on-hand inventory stored outside. Granular MOP, which degrades if left in open air, inventory must be rebuilt, with shipments unlikely to resume until second-half June at the earliest.
ICL also has two cargoes of standard MOP scheduled for shipment to India, despite the producer having no formal supply deal in place. ICL is expected to negotiate supply contracts with Indian buyers soon. Once concluded, India will have an estimated 4.5mn-4.7mn t MOP firm committed through contracts with options to raise the total to 5mn- 5.2mn t.

since December 2014.
International sulfur highlights
In Saudi Arabia, Aramco Trading's July lifting price for sulfur to term customers has been announced at $144/t fob, a rise of $2/t on June.
Sulfuric acid
The MTM Houston has been fixed to load 19,000t of sulfuric acid in Sweden or Finland 1-10 July and will discharge on the US east coast. The vessel did not impact the US spot sulfuric acid assessment, which was unchanged at $70-80/t cfr for the 26th week.
Sulfur and sulfuric acid
Sulfur
Syncrude halted sulfur shipments 8 June from its facilities in Alberta because of high levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), continuing the issues that have hindered the oil consortium for two months. Syncrude had restarted shipments around 11 May after stopping them in mid-April, but had to curtail loading again on 22 May. Shipments had resumed 26 May before being stopped again this week.
The US has been able to make up from less Canadian imports with its own supply. The US produced 2.8mn t of sulfur the first four months this year, compared to 2.7mn t in 2014. The increase in production has come despite the boom in light US crude production, as refinery rates reach record highs. Refinery utilization in the US Gulf coast reached 98.4pc the week ended 5 June, the highest figure since the EIA started tracking that data in June 2010. Overall US refinery produc- tion was 94.6pc the week ended 5 June, the highest level
It is understood that Teck’s Trail smelter in British Colum- bia – a key source of supply in the Pacific Northwest – has a turnaround planned in June, though the extent and timing of the work is unclear. The facility produces around 42,000 t/month of sulfuric acid, which is marketed by International Raw Materials (IRM).
Furthermore, Sherritt International has a planned main- tenance scheduled for the second quarter this year at its cobalt refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. There have been discussions that the plant has had sulfuric acid sup- ply disruptions in recent weeks. The facility’s 208,000 t/yr sulfuric acid production is marketed by Chemtrade.
International sulfuric acid highlights
In Brazil, Paranapanema is increasing the nameplate capacity at its Dias d'Avila sulfuric acid plant in Bahia state by 30,000t/yr to 600,000-650,000t/yr in 2015. Operations will be impacted by the work, and the company is currently in the market for supply to meet contractual commitments with clients.
Fertilizer news
Wet weather boosts wheat production: USDA
Late-season rains will boost US wheat yields and production this year, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report projected the US will produce 2.1bn bushels of wheat in 2015, up by 95mn bushel from last year. While the area planted will fall by 1.4mn acres year-over-year to 55.4mn acres in 2015, yields will jump to 44.2 bushels/acre from 43.5 bushels/acre in 2014.
The rise in production will also boost ending stocks of wheat by 21mn bushels year-over-year to 814mn bushels in 2015, the highest total since the 2010 crop season. The expected uptick in supply weighed on projected average farm prices for wheat, which fell 10¢/bushel on the low and high end to $4.40-5.40/bushel for 2015, down from $6/bushel in 2014.
July wheat futures prices dropped after the data. Front- month prices had climbed to their highest levels since April on concerns about condition and harvest because of heavy storms late in May, but fell by as much as 17¢/bushel in mid-

day trading to $5.16/bushel.
Total US corn supply will climb to 15.5bn bushels in 2015, up 59mn bushels from last year. The higher supply forecast stems from higher beginning stocks, which are expected to total 1.9bn bushels in 2015, up from 1.2bn bushels last year. US corn production (13.6bn bushels), yields (166.8 bushels/ acre) and ethanol use (5.2bn bushels) are all unchanged from last month's WASDE.
The projected 2015 average farm price for corn was also unchanged at $3.20-3.80/bushel, compared to the 2014 esti- mate of $3.55-3.75/bushel. Front-month corn futures prices fell to a low of $3.60/bushel in midday trading, down 5¢/ bushel yesterday's close.
Global 2015 corn production is estimated at 989.3mn t (38.9bn bushels), down slightly from last year's 996.1mn t estimate. Total corn consumption is expected to grow by 14.2mn t to a record 991.1mn t, with notable demand growth in Africa.
Total US soybean supply will climb by 119mn bushels year- over-year to 4.2bn bushels in 2015, despite annual produc- tion falling 119mn bushels to 3.9mn bushels. Higher begin- ning stocks will buoy soybean supply, jumping 238mn bushels year-over-year to 330mn bushels. Ending soybean stocks will jump 145mn bushels to 475mn bushels in 2015.
The projected 2015 average farm price for soybeans was unchanged from last month at $8.25-9.75/bushel, compared to the 2014 estimate of $10.05/bushel. Front-month soybeans prices fell as much as 7¢/bushel to a low of $9.44/bushel in midday trading.
Global soybean production will fall a slight 670,000t (26.4mn bushels) year-over-year to 317.6mn t in 2015 on lower output from China, Paraguay and the US. Global soybean use will rise, however, jumping 11.7mn t (461mn bushels) year-over- year to 305.6mn t. Despite lower projected production, global ending stocks will climb to 96.2mn t in 2015, com- pared to 83.7mn t in 2014.
US crop conditions stable after floods
The impact on crops from heavy storms and flooding two weeks ago were still negligible for the week ended 7 June, with no crops sustaining major setbacks, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report.
Overall winter wheat condition was rated 30pc good or
excellent, with 20pc of the crop rated poor or very poor, unchanged from the previous week. Kansas (29pc), Nebraska (33pc) and South Dakota (37pc) showed the largest amount of wheat rated poor or very poor, while 11 of the top 18 pro- ducing states reported at least 50pc rated good or excellent.
The inclement weather did delay harvests for winter wheat, which is 4pc finished, eight percentage points down from the five-year average. Harvesting in Texas (20pc) and Oklahoma (13pc) showed effects from the heavy storms, falling 10 percentage points and 24 percentage points behind their respective averages.
Front-month wheat prices reflected concerns for worse con- ditions, climbing for the seventh straight day. July futures prices settled 7 June at $5.28/bushel, the highest value since 2 April.
Spring wheat conditions were also stable, rating 69pc good or excellent, down just two percentage points from last week and the same time last year. Spring wheat was 97pc emerged, well ahead of its 80pc five-year average.
The number of days suitable for fieldwork was markedly im- proved the week ended 7 June, with most states in the Corn Belt and south showing at a least a full day improvement.
The biggest gains were made in Illinois (4.6), Iowa (4.3), Kan- sas (4.1), Louisiana (5.1), Missouri (2.0) and Oklahoma (4.6).
Corn conditions were stable at 74pc good or excellent, unchanged from last week and one percentage point ahead of the same week last year. Texas (10pc), Kansas (13pc) and Missouri (12pc) were the only states to report 10pc or more of corn in poor or very poor condition. Twelve of the top 18 producing states reported at least 70pc of corn in good or excellent condition.
US corn was 91pc emerged, up slightly from the five-year average of 90pc. Colorado (72pc), Kansas (79pc) and North Dakota (72pc) were the only states to report less than 85pc of corn emerged.
Soybean plantings continued to lag behind the five-year average, likely because of wet weather limiting fieldwork. Plantings are 79pc finished the week ended 7 June, two per- centage points behind the average. Planting completions in Kansas (31pc) and Missouri (30pc) are 45 percentage points and 39 percentage points behind their respective averages. Soybeans are 64pc emerged, however, one percentage point ahead of the five-year average.

Cotton conditions were rated 50pc good or excellent the week ended 7 June, the first week reported by the USDA. Just 7pc of overall cotton was rated poor, with none rated very poor.
Grain shippers, railroads debate rates
Grain shippers say they face skyrocketing rates and an un- workable process for challenging them, but railroads say one commodity should not receive special treatment and that rates are reasonable and market-based.
Shippers and railroads outlined their sharply differing views to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) this week at a public hearing that had railroads defending their treatment of grain shippers. STB acting chairwoman Deb Miller has pub- licly acknowledged that bringing a rate case to the board is too long and expensive and she wants to reform the board’s processes.
At the hearing in Washington DC, board members asked detailed questions and heard from a diverse set of market participants concerning the situation facing grain shippers. STB appears focused on making changes, but railroads are digging in on the issue of carving out any special rules for the sector.
Grain shippers are unsure whether they have standing to bring a case, making them even more hesitant to bring rate cases to the board. Unlike a commodity such as coal, there is no regulatory history and precedent from which shippers and railroads can determine whether a certain rate is fair, witnesses said. Railroads argue that no rate cases have been brought because rates are already fair.
US Department of Agriculture deputy under secretary Gary Woodward encouraged STB to simplify rate cases, lower costs for shippers, and increase use of mediation and arbi- tration to resolve rate disputes. While railroads talk about efficiency gains on the system through massive capital investment, grain shippers argue that rising rates do not reflect that enhanced efficiency. There is benefit for every- body if railroads earn sufficient returns on their investments, but the natural monopolies they represent call for change, Woodward said.
American Association of Railroads (AAR) counsel Timothy Strafford argued that STB’s processes are accessible, point- ing out its Rail Customer and Public Assistance Program that gives the public informal access to staff and voluntary resolution of rail service issues. STB has lowered filing fees
and increased limits on simplified cases, he said.
There is “no reason to craft special rate reasonableness rules for grain shippers,” he said.
The three benchmark methodology “is already a frail sys- tem,” he said, referring to an STB process that compares the markup on the challenged rate to the average markup assessed on other comparable traffic.
The board also uses the “stand-alone cost” test which says the rate being contested cannot be higher than the rate a hypothetical efficient railroad would need to charge while fully covering its costs. This process is seen as cumbersome because it requires shippers to construct a hypothetical railroad.
With both processes under fire, it appears likely STB will take action on grain rates. But it faces a delicate balance in serving the interests of bother shippers and railroads.
Texas governor signs fertilizer bill into law
Texas governor Greg Abbott on 9 June signed to law a bill that will create guidelines for the storage and inspection of ammonium nitrate.
House Bill 942 is a response to the fertilizer explosion in West, Texas, two years ago that killed 15 people. The legis- lation will authorize fire marshals to inspect facilities storing ammonium nitrate and creates strict reporting guidelines for housing the fertilizer. The regulations will take effect 1 September 2016.
Ammonium nitrate imports into the US have dropped since the West explosion, with some suppliers opting not to carry the product because of regulatory and safety concerns. US ammonium nitrate imports the first four months of the year were 207,030t, down 5.9pc from the same period in 2014 and 37.8 from 2013.
Fire erupts at Pennsylvania plant
A fire broke out and engulfed a fertilizer warehouse just outside Hanover, Pennsylvania, in the early morning 8 June, forcing local officials to monitor water contamination and urge local residents to stay indoors.
A building at Miller Chemical and Fertilizer’s facility in Cone- wago Township caught fire around 3:30 am 8 June and was destroyed by late morning. The cause of the fire was not disclosed.
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
York County officials said contamination in the Conewago Creek had “reportedly killed an unknown quantity of fish” an advised residents against fishing or swimming in the water.
Miller Chemical and Fertilizer is an NPK blender and retailer. It also sells other agricultural chemicals.
NuStar NH3 pipeline resumes normal service
The NuStar ammonia pipeline that runs from Louisiana north into the midwest, resumed normal operations late this week after problems at a pumping station halted loadings at some terminals on the eastern leg.
"[There were] some issues at a pump station on the south end of the system that affected the east leg deliveries, but repairs have been completed and we were back up and running at full capacity as of 12am Thursday," a company spokesperson said.
Ammonia demand for sidedress applications in the eastern Corn Belt is expected to pick up this weekend if weather permits.
The 2,000 mile pipeline originates in Louisiana where it has access to three marine terminals and and three ammonia plants on the Mississippi river. The line runs north into Mis- souri, where it branches west into Nebraska and east into Illinois and Indiana.
Tetco: Arkansas river nat gas line detached
A 400ft segment of a natural gas pipeline which leaked in the Arkansas river on 31 May broke away and was pushed downstream, said Spectra Energy, the owner and operator of the line.
The pipeline — which serves as a back up to the Texas East- ern Transmission (Tetco) mainline — was not in service at the time of the leak but about 3.9mn cf (110,370 m³) of gas was released.
Sonar surveys showed that the 400ft segment of the pipeline traveled downstream from its original location and lies along the north bank of the Arkansas river. The nearest end of the pipe segment appears to be about 100ft downstream from the original pipeline crossing.
Spectra said it is developing plans to remove the disconnect- ed pipe for inspection as soon as river conditions permit.
The 31 May incident caused the US Coast Guard to close a
2-mile section of the Arkansas river between mile markers 116 to 118, as the river experienced high water levels. The section re-opened on the evening of 5 June.
Spectra also isolated the Tetco mainline in the same area as a precaution. "The mainline is intact and was operating properly after the incident," Spectra said.
Sonar surveys showed that about 450ft of the Tetco mainline is partially uncovered in the riverbed. Spectra said that it is taking steps to verify the integrity of the mainline prior to placing it back into operation.
The back-up line was inspected in 2012 for corrosion or mechanical damage and no areas of concern were identi- fied, Spectra said. The US Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration requires this type of inspection — known as an in-line inspection — every seven years.
In addition, Spectra said that it conducted a diver survey in 2011 to evaluate the depth of riverbed soil over the mainline and the auxiliary line and found no areas of concern, includ- ing no exposed pipeline.
Senate challenge to EPA water rules advances
The US Senate Environment and Public Works committee ap- proved a bill on 10 June aimed at blocking the Environmen- tal Protection Agency (EPA) and US Army Corps of Engineers from promulgating newly finalized rules on waters protected by the Clean Water Act.
The Federal Water Quality Protection Act (S 1140) would force EPA and the corps to withdraw their rules and rewrite them after doing further consultation with state and local governments. It now awaits a vote by the full Senate.
A separate bill blocking the new rules passed the House of Representatives last month but the White House has threat- ened to veto it.
EPA and the corps released the final rules on 27 May, intend- ing to clarify what types of waterways are governed by the federal Clean Water Act. But they have not yet been pub- lished in the Federal Register. They will become effective 60 days after publication.
Republicans and some industry groups have criticized the agencies' actions as a move by the agencies to expand fed- eral authority. EPA has denied that, saying that the revisions expanded waterways covered by the Clean Water Act by just

3pc. The agencies also claim to have carefully reviewed the more than 1mn comments received between the time they initially proposed changes and when the rule was finalized.
"No matter what concessions EPA has claimed, they added new provisions that greatly expand their authority," bill sponsor senator John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) said at today's hearing. "It is possible to have reasonable regulations that help preserve our waterways while still protecting the dif- ference between state waters and federal waters."
Committee ranking member Barbara Boxer (D-California) and others were strongly opposed to the bill. But proposed amendments to soften it were not passed.
"We should not be tearing apart the Clean Water Act," Boxer said. "Instead of advancing a bill that would allow more pol- lution of our waterways we should listen to the wide variety of stakeholders that support" the new rules. She said a poll taken last month said 78pc of people think Congress should allow the rule to move forward.
US biofuel mandates will rely on biodiesel: EIA
US biofuel blending mandates proposed in late May and pub- lished in the federal register today do little to increase the use of higher ethanol fuels but will significantly lift biodies- el, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
EIA's interpretation of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed 2015 and 2016 blending volumes explain why only biodiesel groups greeted the measures with applause when they were introduced 29 May, as well as why there was a sharp drop in prices for ethanol credits used to comply with the mandates.
Nested blending volumes set out each year under the Re- newable Fuel Standard (RFS) require refiners, importers and other companies to blend increasing volumes of biofuels into the US transportation fuel supply.
Proposed requirements for biodiesel would lift consumption of that fuel by 11pc this year and 21pc in 2016 compared to 2014 volumes.
"EIA expects the biggest effect of the proposed RFS targets to be on biomassed-based diesel consumption," the agency said in a short-term energy outlook published yesterday.
But ethanol consumption will only measurably increase with consumer access and interest in higher-ethanol gasoline fuels
that many US retailers may not physically or legally provide, a problem called the blend wall.
A forecast decline in gasoline demand — by 20,000 b/d next year, according to the EIA — will chip away at ethanol blend- ing without increased sales of mid-level and high-ethanol gasoline blends called E15 and E85.
US ethanol output reaches six-month high: EIA
US ethanol production increased 2pc to 992,000 b/d in the week ended 5 June, marking the highest output seen since December 2014, according to the Energy Information Admin- istration.
Total ethanol production was up 20,000 b/d from the
972,000 b/d seen last week, marking five consecutive weeks of increases in output. Production in the midcontinent climbed 2.5pc from 889,000 b/d to 909,000 b/d, reaching the highest level since the EIA began recording information on the region in 2010.
Ethanol stocks increased 0.9pc on the week to reach 20.2mn bl, reversing two straight weeks of inventory draws. The uptick in nationwide inventories was bolstered by a 6.9pc increase in the midcontinent, a 3.2pc increase in the east coast, and a 2.4pc increase in the west coast. After marking a five-year high last week, Gulf Coast stocks fell 13.4pc to 3.5mn bl.
