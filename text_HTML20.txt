Market summary
Market still flat with a bullish undertone
Prices have been holding in most regions but offers are rising in Latin America and ex-China. Moroccan and Russian MAP are on offer above $505/t cfr Brazil and above $510/t cfr Argentina. However, no sales have been concluded at these higher levels yet. In China, a producer reports the sale of 60,000t DAP to India at $468-470/t fob while Wengfu reports the sale of MAP at $480/t fob for Latin America. Sabic has sold DAP to Pakistan’s United Agro in the mid-$480s/t cfr while Fauji is inquiring for 30,000-40,000t DAP for July ship- ment. OCP has sold DAP to Turkey in the mid-$500s/t fob.
In production news, a fire at ICL’s Amfert Rotem’s TSP/SSP plant broke out on 10 June but it is too early to tell what the impact will be on its output.

June 2015 DAP/MAP/NPK commitments - main producers
Market analysis
Subscriber note: Please note amended prices for phosphate rock cfr India 2Q (70-72) and fob North Africa 2 Q (69) in the Argus FMB weekly phosphates report dated 11 June 2015.
The global phosphates market is relatively balanced. Sup- pliers on the whole are comfortable and those with unsold tonnes, particularly for Latin America, do not feel under pressure in anticipation of further seasonal demand emerg- ing. On the demand side, India and Latin America remain the focus although trade activity in India has slowed slightly on adequate supply for the kharif season.
Bangladesh’s DAP/TSP tender continues to hold the market’s attention this week. Uncertainty remains over the level of
producer backing for DAP but letters of credit have been requested to be opened by today, 11 June, which should pro- vide a clearer indication of who will take what and at what prices. The awards are expected to be confirmed in the next couple of weeks before shipping commences late June/ early July. As it stands, if all those invited open l/cs, then it seems that China will mop up almost all the 400,000t DAP that Bangladesh has tendered for while some have indicated that Australian DAP could also be in the supply mix.
Based on this likely outcome, Chinese producers are set for a fairly comfortable Q3 against continued demand from India, Pakistan and Southeast Asia. Moreover, Latin American MAP demand will also provide some Chinese producers with an additional outlet although this shipping window will likely close before the end of July for the product to arrive in time. Nevertheless, Chinese order books should be fairly full through to its domestic fall application season.
So it is no surprise to see a slight firming in Chinese DAP prices to the mid-$460s/t fob minimum. This is in contrast to reports in India of buyers countering offers with lower numbers below the mid-$470s/t cfr on account of adequate supplies for June/July. It is estimated that India has booked close to 3 mn t during April-July. Moreover, concerns over the strength of the monsoon and a weak rupee are also playing a role in this downward price pressure being placed by the buyers. But in reality, barring a disastrous monsoon, suppliers know that India needs to buy another 2.5mn t this year. Factor in the additional demand from Saudi Arabia and China’s traditional demand markets during these next few months and an uptick in price seems more likely, albeit this will be limited and India pricing will depend on several key factors including the maximum retail price (MRP), the value of the Indian rupee and the strength of the monsoon.
Elsewhere on the supply side, the Saudis have made a partial switch to MAP which will limit DAP supply for India and Pakistan while the Moroccans are sold out for June. OCP has yet to begin negotiations for July but has indicated that it intends to ship at least one cargo to the US, possibly more if the Q3 phosphoric acid price in India settles early – discus- sions begin next week.
TSP availability in the next few months is looking tight. OCP has around 150,000t committed to Bangladesh through to September and estimates that it will only have around 30,000t available for spot purchase during this time. More- over, a fire reported at ICL’s Rotem Amfert plant on 10 June could also impact ICL’s TSP/SSP output but it is too early to

tell the extent of the damage. On top of this, uncertainty remains over GCT’s TSP output.
In Latin America, prices are holding. Sales continue to be made at $500/t cfr in Brazil although offers have increased to $505-510/t cfr while Argentinean offers have risen to $510-515/t cfr. Some Chinese 11-52 has been sold in this region and more could be on its way with YUC switching partially to MAP 11-52 production. Availability of Chinese
10-50 and 11-44 in July, however, is uncertain due to time constraints with the shipping window likely to close around mid-July in order for the product to arrive in time in Latin America. The main concern here, however, is the strength of demand on account of a weak Brazilian Real as well as poor crop prices.

May/June/July 2015 phosphate tenders
North America
US
Mosaic has sold small lots of DAP/MAP to North and Central America at $471-475/t fob for July shipment.
Domestic
Activity has slowed with planting demand largely concluded and buyers assessing needs in advance of the fall season. June-loading domestic DAP traded at $420/st fob Nola on spotty demand for late-season applications in the south. Prices look flat heading into the third quarter with paper bids and offers hovering around the $420/st fob Nola level. Demand for physical barges is likely to remain seasonally limited, however downside price pressure is viewed to be minimal given Nola’s discount to global markets, which makes large quantities of imports unlikely in the near term. OCP, however, did indicate that it intend to ship at least one DAP/MAP cargo to the US in July.
Central and Latin America
Brazil
Small lots of up to 5,000t of MAP 11-52-0 ex-Morocco for June lifting have been sold at $500/t cfr Rio Grande and OCP has now upped its offer to $505/t cfr Rio Grande or Parana-
gua and to $510-515/t cfr Itaqui for product shipping in June and July.
US sales totalling 25,000t of MAP 11-52-0 and 15,000t of DAP 18-46-0 for July shipment have been concluded at $500/t cfr for discharge at several ports, including Aratu, Recife and Rio Grande. These sales are understood to have been reported previously by Mosaic.
Two handysized vessels of Chinese MAP 11-44-0 and MAP 10- 50-0 in combination with TSP are on offer. Around 10,000t of MAP 10-50-0 in small lots have traded at $455-465/t cfr Rio Grande. The MAP 11-44-0 portion is offered at $400/t cfr and above.
Brazilian MAP imports fell by a third in the first five months of this year according to latest GTIS statistics, as poor farmer economics, a weak Real and high inventories from Q4 continued to take their toll. However, May imports have rallied strongly as the season approaches.
Imports of MAP in May hit 263,003t, up nearly 170,000t on the previous month, following a buying spree and price ap- preciation in April.

Of the total, 102,936t were sourced from Russia, through direct sales and via traders. Chinese MAP accounted for 65,511t, with US material recording 56,373t.
Year-to-date imports have reached 709,228t, down 33.5pc. Russia formed the largest share, with 254,868t, down a third on the same period of 2014. The US was second with 168,688t, up 7.4pc. OCP Morocco's decision to switch away from Brazil in Q1 is still reflected in the numbers with only 114,874t moved, down 61.7pc. China accounted for 109,403t, up 6.3pc.
DAP imports for the calendar year to date are down by slightly less at 239,706t, a fall of 25.6pc. The US has been the largest supplier with 149,931t, down 32.5pc year on year. Russia is some way behind in second with 35,525t. Saudi Ara- bia and Morocco accounted for around 27,000t each.
For the month of May, Brazil imported 60,968t DAP, with almost half supplied from the US, 20,000t from Saudi Arabia via traders and 7,000t from OCP.
Argentina
A buyer has purchased 5,000t of US MAP at $505/t cfr for July shipment. This sale is understood to have been covered under Mosaic’s reported 38,000t DAP/MAP/MES sale to South America reported last week.
Russian MAP is on offer at $510/t cfr while OCP is also re- portedly offering DAP/MAP at $510/t cfr minimum. At least two buyers report being offered Chinese 11-52 at $500-505/t cfr while Chinese 10-50 is at $460-475/t cfr.
Europe and former Soviet Union
Russia
EuroChem has sold an additional 5,000t of Lifosa DAP at a stable $500/t fob for June delivery to eastern Europe. Its June Lifosa DAP sales now total 15,000-20,000t. It still has 50,000-60,000t available this month.
Its next available MAP cargo will be in July. The producer is still targeting $490/t fob.
Turkey
OCP has sold 30,000t of DAP to a Turkish buyer in the low- $510s/t cfr for loading end June/early July. It is not clear if this shipment has been made under the recently announced OCP supply agreement with Toros.
Turkish DAP imports in April totalled 16,484t versus 3,791t in the same month of 2014, according to latest GTIS data. Russia was the primary source, accounting for 14,002t while a smaller volume of 2,450t was sourced from Jordan.
Despite a rise in imports during April, total DAP deliveries during the first four months of 2015 dropped by 27pc year- on-year to 68,578t. Of this total, 39,952t originated in Jor- dan, 17,002t came from Russia and 11,465t was from Tunisia.
Africa and Middle East
Saudi Arabia
Ma’aden still has a DAP cargo available for loading mid/late- June and continues to be offering in Pakistan at a netback in the $480s/t fob.
Negotiations are also underway for DAP/MAP in Africa and South America for early July shipment.
Sabic reports the sale of a July DAP cargo to Pakistan in the mid-$480s/t cfr, which would netback to the mid-$470s/t fob.
Sabic will ship 2 x 40,000t DAP cargoes to India in June with the first loading from Ras Al-Khair on 19 June and the second parcel on 23 June.
It will also load 25,000t MAP on 3 July for South Africa, as reported last week.
Morocco
OCP reports the sale of 30,000t DAP to Turkey at a price netting back to $504-505/t fob. The parcel will load end June/early July.
The producer says it is sold out for June and will begin dis- cussing July shipments next week.
OCP has indicated it will ship at least one DAP/MAP cargo to the US in July. Another cargo could also be lined up depend- ing on when the Q3 phosphoric acid price is settled.
OCP's new 1mn t DAP/MAP/NPK line is still in the com- missioning phase and production is being ramped up. The producer expects the line to be operating at full capacity in August/September.

Indian subcontinent
India
Zuari has purchased 60,000t of Chinese DAP at a price un- derstood to be close to $480/t cfr.
Chambal has also purchased 40,000t of Chinese DAP at a price indicated around $480/t cfr.
RCF has issued a purchase tender, closing 22 June, for a total of 75,000t DAP, of which 40,000t should be delivered to Mundra and 35,000t to Gangavaram in the first half of August. Offers should be valid for 15 days.
Overall, Indian deliveries are adequate with the June line-up standing at just over 850,000t while July deliveries total 410,000t so far. Total DAP imports during April-July are estimated to be close to 3mn t. Due to this adequate supply, some buyers are countering offers with bids in the low/mid- $470s/t cfr for July shipment.
The monsoon remains a concern for importers as does the value of the rupee which currently stands at Rs63.84:$1, but the latter issue appears to be a bigger worry and is prevent- ing any sharp upticks in price.
The Department of Fertilizers (DoF) is understood to have held a meeting on 10 June to revisit the freight subsidy sys- tem for fertilizers. Earlier this year, it was announced that freight rates would be incorporated into the subsidy which would be beneficial for a number of states where transpor- tation costs are high due to the distance from the ports. But it has now emerged that the government is reconsidering this new freight subsidy programme.
Provisional FAI data shows that DAP sales in May totalled 838,000t while stocks at the end of the month amounted to 309,000t.
Pakistan
Sabic reports the sale of a DAP cargo in the mid-$480s/t cfr to United Agro for July shipment.
Fauji has invited offers for 30,000-40,000t of DAP for July delivery. Offers were to be submitted by 11 June.
Ma'aden continues to offer a June cargo in the $490s/t cfr while Chinese DAP has been indicated in the high-$480s/t cfr.
Bangladesh
Bangladesh's Ministry of Agriculture has invited participants under its 31 May DAP tender to open l/cs by 11 June. Partici- pants offering DAP in the range of $479-490.55/t cfr to cover the 400,000t requirement were invited to open l/cs.
The DAP offers are understood to net in the $460-470/t fob China range.
The level of producer backing in the DAP tender remains unclear.
East Asia and Oceania
China
A Chinese producer has sold 60,000t and 40,000t DAP cargoes to India for June shipment at a price around $480/t cfr. Freight for the panamax has been indicated at $10-12/t providing a netback of $468-470/t fob.
Most market players seem to agree that the $460/t fob level has gone and sales at that level are now unachievable from producers. In contrast to this, the awards for the Bangladesh DAP tender appear to reflect $460-470/t fob but the level of producer backing remains unclear.
For Pakistan and India, prices are pegged in the low/mid- $460s/t fob while higher numbers are being sought for Southeast Asia.
On MAP, Wengfu reports the sale of 5,000t MAP 11-52 to Latin America at $480/t fob.
YUC reports to be now producing MAP 11-52 and is also targeting $480/t fob. It says it has a cargo available for late June/early July loading.
MAP 11-44 is offered in the $370s/t fob for July shipment but no fresh business has been reported. MAP 10-50 is at $415- 420/t fob.

As of 11 June, DAP inventory at Chinese ports totalled 430,000t compared to 420,000t two weeks ago. These include 150,000t at Zhanjiang port, 150,000t at Fangcheng port and 70,000t at Beihai port.
China Domestic
The domestic DAP market is steady. The DAP price in the southwest of the country remains at RMB3,000-3,050/t northeast delivery this week, equivalent to RMB2,650/t ex-works. Hubei producers are still holding at RMB2,700/t ex-works.
Producers are satisfied with their current position and are reluctant to reduce their DAP price to meet Indian bids. Indian buyers are saying the drought and the depreciation of the Indian rupee will deter Indian farmers from buying in the short-term. But producers are confident that India will be back in the market because they need to buy for rabi.
The major producers are sold out to end June while some have no availability until July.
The MAP price remained stable-to-firm this week. Demand from NPK producers is still strong. Most MAP producers are booked out to end June or early July. The mainstream MAP price remained steady at around RMB2,000/t ex-works for 55pc powder in the southwest and at RMB2,100 /t ex-works in Hubei province.
TSP
Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka's Ministry of Agriculture closed a tender on 9 June, for 18,000t TSP for August delivery.
Swiss Singapore offered the lowest price at $339.33/t cfr with 180 days' credit and $341.30/t cfr with 270 days' credit.
Agri Com offered $345.50/t cfr with 180 days' credit and $348.65/t cfr with 270 days' credit.
These prices are estimated to net back to the low-$300s/t fob China after allowing for freight, financing, margin and other costs.
Bangladesh
Bangladesh's Ministry of Agriculture has invited participants under its 31 May TSP tender to open l/cs by 11 June.
Participants offering TSP in the range of $460-473/t cfr to cover its 200,000t requirement have been invited. Under the
tender, the Tunisians (Salakta) will take 50,000t, the Leba- nese 45,000t, the Bulgarians 30,000t and the Moroccans will take the balance of 75,000t.
Moroccan netbacks for the TSP are estimated in the mid- $400s/t fob with a similar number for Lebanese material.
Argentina
Mexican TSP is reportedly on offer at $390/t cfr while Chi- nese TSP is on offer at $365/t cfr.
Brazil
A part-cargo of 7,000t of Chinese TSP has traded at $365/t cfr Paranagua. A cargo of Mexican TSP 45pc P2O5 for June shipment is on offer at $390/t cfr Aratu. Lebanese TSP for June delivery has been sold in the mid/high-$390s/t cfr. It follows the sales of two cargoes of 25,000t of Tunisian TSP, which have been sold in the mid-$390s/t cfr for delivery at Rio Grande and Paranagua.
A part-cargo of 15,000t off a 25,000t vessel of Egyptian SSP 18pc P2O5 for mid-July delivery has been sold at $170/t cfr Itaqui.
Israel
A fire broke out at Rotem Amfert's fertilizer plant in Dimona on 10 June. A statement from ICL, the parent company of Rotem Amfert, reveals that the fire has now been extin- guished.
A number of employees have sustained minor injuries relat- ing to smoke inhalation but have been treated and released by the site's infirmary.
ICL will evaluate the damage of the plant in due course.

Company News
Cominco completes feasibility study on Congo phosphate rock project
Cominco Resources Limited (Cominco) has completed its de- finitive feasibility study of its 100pc-owned Hinda Phosphate Project in Congo.
The study revealed that the phosphate rock project, located in the coastal province of Kouilou of Congo and just 37km from the port of Pointe-Noire, is technically and commer- cially robust. It concludes that the project could repay its $601mn development cost within 26 months of production.
As part of the development plans, an open cut mining opera- tion will be established at the site. Ore from the mine will be delivered to a beneficiation plant where it will upgrade the apatite to produce phosphate rock with a 32pc P2O5 grade. This rock will then be transported via a slurry pipe- line to an export facility at Pointe Indienne, north of Pointe- Noire. Product dewatering, drying, storage and ship loading facilities will be built at Pointe Indienne.
The project costs include all equipment and plants required to support the mining and processing activities as well as costs associated with the necessary infrastructure and ser- vices to facilitate the logistical requirements to enable the export of the phosphate rock.
