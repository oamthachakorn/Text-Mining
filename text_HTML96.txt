ANALYSIS
Prices steady but signs of possible declines to come
Sulphuric acid markets remained roughly balanced with prices unchanged week on week, but there were signs of possible declines in the weeks to come.
Most market participants continued to agree with the current assessed range of $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe for spot exports, but one buyer indicated that they had received offers from NW Europe at $25/mt FOB.
Although some said availability remained relatively tight, others believed it had improved.
On the demand side, Brazil is currently the key buyer of European spot. Prices to there have been unchanged for several months, with Mosaic’s recent 12,000 mt tender reportedly awarded in the mid- $80s/mt CFR. Meanwhile, Petrobras has indicated that it will decide on its 60,000 mt tender on Friday July 3, though whether it takes all, some, or none of the total volume at this stage will likely depend on offer levels.
Morocco is not currently active on the spot market due to its reduced acid requirement, though sellers are confident the buyer would consider buying if a deal were sufficiently attractive.
The US has remained absent from the spot market.
European Q3 contracts were reported at a rollover, in line with expectations.
In the other key spot export market of East Asia, prices also seemed likely to dip pending any unexpected surprises.
Although no firm indications have yet suggested a decline in the $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, at least the upper end of this range seems unlikely to be achieved given current spot demand levels.
Indian buyers have reduced their prompt requirements and their prices ideas, and the upcoming FACT tender will give a better indication of current levels. One trader suggested prices to India as low as $10-16/mt FOB Japan, but other market participants were dismissive of such levels.
The Chilean spot market remains quiet, and market participants are waiting to see if demand there surfaces.
Other potentially market-moving events in the near future will be the restart of PASAR, likely within the next couple of weeks, and Fertinal’s requirement for three cargoes for Q4. The former will likely be bearish, at least in the medium term, while the latter could be more bullish, particularly given the expectation of large turnarounds at Asian smelters in Q4.
Meanwhile, Japan’s May exports of sulphuric acid jumped 51.6% year on year to 258,432 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year up 2.6% at 1.18 million mt.

∙Offers from NW Europe reported as low as $25/mt FOB
∙Lacklustre Indian demand leads to lower price ideas
∙PASAR yet to restart
∙Japanese May exports jump 51.6%
Base Metals
Base metals were again down overall week on week, as concerns over a potential Greek default on sovereign debt and a possible eurozone exit continued to weigh heavily on markets. LME copper was at $5,755/mt for cash.
DAP & Sulphur
Unsurprisingly there is little discussion of US acid or liquid sulphur pricing ahead of the US Independence Day holiday. Serious talks are more likely to start next week regarding liquid sulphur, with some knock-on result for acid values in the US Gulf.
Further signs of slightly higher sulphur spot prices emerged this week, as Tasweeq posted its July QSP at $149/mt FOB, up $8/mt, and Adnoc posted its July OSP at $150/mt FOB, up $5/mt. Spot sales from the Middle East were reported as high as $150/mt FOB, though CFR levels in China and elsewhere were mostly stable on the week.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices slipped slightly to $1,730-1,750/mt CFR China this week after being stable for six weeks following increases that began in mid-January. In recent days caprolactam June 2015 contract prices were fully settled at $1,770-1,810/mt CFR at sight in Taiwan and at $1,780-1,800/mt CFR basis 90 days in China. Sinopec concluded its June contract at RMB13,850/mt while DSM/Nanjing settled at RMB14,100/mt.
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Petrobras yet to decide on 60,000 mt tender
Petrobras has indicated that it will make a decision regarding its tender for 60,000 mt sulphuric acid this Friday, July 3, according to market sources.
Sources were not certain how much, if any, of the volumes the buyer would commit to, but suggested it would be more likely to commit if the offered levels were below current spot prices in the $80s/mt CFR.
Petrobras needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.
Mosaic’s recent tender for 12,000 mt sulphuric acid, which closed on June 18 and was previously heard in the high $80s/mt CFR, was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR to a European producer.
Market participants are expecting further Brazilian enquiries in July, but nothing firm has emerged yet.
Port data showed that Yara received 18,000 mt at Rio Grande via Trammo from Antwerp on the Chemroad Hope May 17.
EUROPE
Europe: Q3 contracts settle at rollover
European Q3 contracts for sulphuric acid have been settled unchanged from the previous quarter, several sources confirmed.
One seller said that they achieved a single small increase, but all of their other contracts were a rollover.
Market participants agreed with the assessed range of €57-80/mt CFR, though the upper end of the range will represent only a small minority of settlements.
Sources saw the market as balanced to tight.
Europe: FOB spot steady but indications either side
European spot prices for export were assessed unchanged based on recent business, though there were price ideas either side of the current $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe range.
The most recent reported sale was Mosaic’s 12,000 mt tender, which closed June 18 and was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR to a European producer. The price is in line with Brazilian sales of the past several month.
One consumer reported offers as low as $25/mt FOB from Belgium. While some said this seemed too low, others said that long loading times might push freights for Belgian sales high enough to reduce netbacks to such a level.
Another trader suggested that business up to $40/mt FOB NW Europe was possible, depending on the port, but others argued that spot prices on current European sales would not reach anywhere near this high.
For now the market appears roughly balanced.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP out of acid spot market
Morocco remains absent from sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced considerably and are currently met by term contracts.
Buyer price ideas were in the low $40s/mt CFR, and spot offers to Morocco from European sellers have reportedly declined in recent weeks.
The buyer reports that its requirement has declined to around 30,000-40,000 mt/month, well below the levels that it has imported over the past year, which averaged around 80,000 mt/month. It is understood that these requirements can be met by current long term contracts.
CRU expects Morocco’s imports for 2015 to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.
Morocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Price ideas lower as demand weakens
Price ideas for Indian sulphuric acid have weakened as a result of the current reduction in spot demand, though market participants are awaiting firmer indications from the upcoming FACT tender.
One trader suggested a current spot price for India of $10-16/mt FOB Japan.
But others argued that even the recent purchase by PPL in the $50s/mt CFR does not net back to a level as low as $16/mt FOB.
Spot price ideas were generally pegged in the $50s/mt CFR, down from recent levels in the $60s/mt CFR or even higher.
This suggests that the upper end of the current assessed range of $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea may no longer be achievable for East Asian spot sellers and the assessment is likely to decline pending further information.
FACT’s tender for 14,000 mt for delivery at Kochi on or before August 31 closes on July 9.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan/South Korea: FOB prices stable, may inch down
East Asian spot export prices were assessed unchanged at $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, but are likely to decline slightly over the coming weeks given improved availability and less prompt spot demand.
Although one source suggested prices to India at $16/mt FOB Japan, others said this would not be achievable, and recent Indian prices remain pegged in the $50s/mt CFR at the lowest.
Spot availability following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi's Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko's Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc's Onahama smelter.
Then in Q2 Korea Zinc's Onsan smelter shut for maintenance, as did the PASAR smelter in the Philippines.
A key driver of increased spot prices has been Indian prompt demand, but this appears to have diminished somewhat.
PASAR is still under maintenance and is likely to restart within the next two weeks. Much uncertainty centres on how much it is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts. Although PASAR’s overall production for the year is not likely to be very different to its 2014 output when taking account the shutdown period, timing may mean that the market feels longer for a period in Q3.
Later in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters, which will remove large volumes from the market.
Japan: May exports jump 52%
Japan’s May exports of sulphuric acid jumped 51.6% year on year to 258,432 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year up 2.6% at 1.18 million mt.
The Philippines remained the key destination for Japanese acid, taking 112,049 mt of the May tonnes.
Chile was the next largest importer, taking 60,837 mt, followed by India with 46,624 mt.
Indonesia took 18,879 mt, Thailand took 12,020 mt, and Taiwan took 8,002 mt. The volume to Indonesia is the largest monthly volume from Japan to that country since March 2014.
