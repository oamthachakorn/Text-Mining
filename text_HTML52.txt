Ship scrapping on the rise as depressed freight market persists
According to fleet data from Simpson Spence Young, at least 24 Panamaxes of 65-99,999 dwt were scrapped during Q1 2015, representing the highest quarter for demolition for three years, as the prolonged spell of low rates has left ship owners struggling to cover their operation costs.
With just 33 new Panamax builds entering the fleet since the turn of the year, net fleet growth in the sector has been limited to 0.5% so far this year.
The seasonal increase in grain cargoes from Latin America is underway. In March combined exports from Brazil of soya, corn and raw sugar reached 9.0 Mt, up from 3.5 Mt in February. Evidently, this has so far had limited positive effect on the freight market.
The first quarter of 2015 marked the lowest quarter for average vessel earnings in the Panamax sector ($4,815/day) since the Baltic Exchange began assessing the four main Panamax time charter routes in 1993.
Rates for smaller and geared dry bulk carriers, such as Supramaxes and Handysizes, have seen some modest increases, but are nonetheless depressed by recent standards. The Q1 earnings for Handysize vessels, for example, averaged $6,434/day, down 46% on the same quarter last year.
Against such a low spot market, forward contracts in the freight futures (FFA) market have declined yet again. The FFA contract for the Panamax four timecharter routes for April-December 2015 were priced at $6,000/day at the beginning of April, down from $7,000/day for the same contract a month before.

Eurochem signs construction deal for five fertilizer plants
EuroChem has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Italian engineering firm, Maire Tecnimont and financial services company SACE regarding the construction of five ammonia-urea plants.
The plants are to be commissioned in Russia, the US and Kazakhstan over the next 10 years with Maire Tecnimont submitting plans for engineering, procurement and construction, and SACE evaluating credit insurance policies for the projects.
In Russia, Eurochem is looking to build an ammonia-urea facility in Nevinnomyssk, near the Black Sea, and an ammonia plant and urea project in Kingisepp, close to Saint Petersburg. Maire Tecnimont has already completed front-end engineering
design for the Nevinnomyssk facility and the Kingisepp ammonia plant.
The companies will also work on two ammonia-urea projects, in Louisiana and Zhanatas, Kazakhstan.
The projects will provide EuroChem with an additional five million tonnes of ammonia and 7.5 million tonnes of urea capacity per year.
Kingisepp will have capacity to produce 2,700 mt/day of ammonia. The Nevinnomyssk plant will add a further 2,700 mt/day of ammonia as well as granular urea capacity of 3,500 mt/day.
In recent years, Eurochem has had a shortfall in ammonia capacity, forcing it to purchase the feedstock from other suppliers. Kingisepp and Nevinnomyssk particularly, while costing an aggregate $2.5 billion before a slated start-up date of 2018, will pare EuroChem's ammonia deficit.
Their development appears to be a way of backward integrating to allow EuroChem to top up its own supply chain, leading it to breakeven on ammonia production, or even become a seller of the product.
The company already has a phosphate fertilizer processing facility at Kingisepp while the sites have easy access to export terminals in Estonia and the Black Sea.
However, with the company also constructing potash operations at Gremyachaya and Berezniki in Russia, there are questions over whether its ambitious capacity additions may place a significant capex burden on its shareholders.
TRADE
Fertilizer index: Falls across all but one benchmanrk
Most fertilizer price benchmarks again declined from a week earlier in this week's Fertilizer Index.
Urea (granular) FOB Middle East underwent the largest proportional drop, declining 2.7% or $6.50/mt to $245.25/mt.
The biggest absolute drops were in Urea (granular) FOB barge NOLA and MAP CFR Brazil. The former fell 2.5% or $6.75/st to $265.75/st while the latter dropped 1.4% or $6.75/mt to $467/mt.
None of the benchmarks increased over the previous week, with only UAN (32% N) FOB Barge NOLA unchanged at $250.50/mt.
The Fertilizer Index is a collection of 10 global fertilizer benchmark prices for financial swaps. The index is jointly owned by CRU Group, Argus FMB and Fertecon and published each Friday.
The index is calculated using an olympic average of the price ranges submitted by all three providers. The highest and lowest of the six numbers for each pricing point are discarded and an average is taken from the remaining four numbers.

INSIGHTS
Insight: How worried should we be about China?
In a repeat of the early months of 2014, worries over the potential for a sharp downturn in the Chinese economy as a result of the massive increase in debt have once again come to the fore.
CRU has long warned of the risks that China experiences a significant economic downturn and, due to the very large share of metals demand that the country accounts for, we view this as the single biggest risk facing metals markets. However, while acknowledging the risk, our base case forecast is that the economy manages a broadly orderly transition to a slower trend rate of growth. Growth that is much less driven by investment and industry as consumption and the service sectors take a more prominent role.
In the first of a series of China focus White Papers we set out our economic base case for China, review potential triggers for a significantly worse outcome, explain what we believe the government's response to such an outturn would look like and present a downside alternative to our base case.
Background and CRU’s base case economic forecasts for China
There are several potential triggers that could initiate a sharp economic downturn, but before turning to them
it is worth briefly reviewing the background to where the economy is now and CRU‟s base case economic
forecasts for China. In terms of background:
∙Maturing economy and adverse demographics: As economies develop it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain extremely rapid growth rates . For China, this is exacerbated by demographic factors which the United Nations forecast will cause the growth in the number of people of working age to slow from an average of 0.4%pa during the five years to 2014 to -0.2%pa in the five years to 2019.
∙Ambitious economic reforms: Linked to China‟s increasing level of economic development, the government is embarking on an ambitious and vital program of economic reforms. In order to sustain a relatively rapid economic catch up with more developed economies and to improve the quality of life of its people, the government is committed to transforming the growth model away from a narrow focus on economic growth driven by investment and industry and to giving markets a greater role in place of the State.
∙Surge in credit: Post-2008 China experienced an increase in leverage that is enormous by international historical experience. The government responded to the global financial crisis that hit in 2008 by announcing a massive stimulus program of RMB4 trillion, equivalent to 13% of GDP. The stimulus was delivered via a surge in bank and non-bank lending that has ultimately seen credit as a share of GDP balloon from 115% at the end of 2008 to 187% at the end of 2014 as local governments and corporates binged on credit to fund investment. The jump in non-bank lending is of particular concern.
Reflecting the economic challenges faced by China, CRU‟s base case forecasts are for GDP growth to decelerate further this year to 6.9% and for growth to average 6.6% in the period to 2019. Having directly accounted for half of the expansion in GDP over the past decade investment now accounts for 46% of the economy – an unusually high share by international historical standards – and bears the brunt of the deceleration, dragging industrial production down with it.
However, we have long flagged that the balance of risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside and it is therefore worth considering potential triggers for a significantly worse outcome.
Risks exist due to the marked increase in the economy’s leverage and the reform program.
(1) Real estate meltdown
The credit surge helped fuel the real estate boom which is now unwinding, with the value of real estate sales dropping by 6% last year and by 16% y/y in the first two months of 2015. A complete record of borrowing for real estate and mortgages is not available but figures for bank loans outstanding, only, show an increase of 237% from the end of 2008 to the end of 2014 compared to a 147% rise in bank lending to the rest of the economy. Together, loans to the real estate sector and for mortgages account for 34% of outstanding bank credit. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the real estate sector has also been heavily reliant on non-bank credit, particularly since 2012 when controls on bank lending to real estate were tightened. Defaults on real estate related loans could cause a credit crunch that would hit the economy hard. Moreover, local governments rely on land sales for one-quarter of their revenues and a sharp downturn in these revenues could force local governments to cut back spending, particularly on infrastructure investment.
(2) Shadow banking crisis
„Shadow banking‟ credit outstanding has grown substantially since 2008 from 17% to 54% of GDP and at the end of 2014 amounted to RMB34 trillion. A key reason for the rapid growth is that shadow banking was subject to less regulation and government control than formal bank lending. The extremely rapid growth, relative loose lending standards and opaqueness of the lending raise concerns over the potential scale of bad loans in shadow banking. Households are directly exposed to shadow banking via their purchases of Wealth Management Products offering higher interest rates than those available via bank deposit accounts. Households may not be aware that their money is at risk. As was seen in early 2014, concerns over the potential for trust funds to default caused a loss of confidence and the risk is that this is repeated on a larger scale.
(3) Reform of local government borrowing
Since 2008 borrowing by local government has increased rapidly and by the end of last year totalled around RMB22 trillion (US$3.7 trillion), or just over one-third of GDP. Due to central government restrictions on direct borrowing by local governments, the bulk of borrowing has been via so-called Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFVs) and outside of budgetary control. In September last year the central government announced a reform of local government borrowing to increase budgetary transparency and discipline. In brief:
∙The reforms allow provincial governments to issue bonds to fund public investment, but lower tiers of government will not be allowed to issue bonds. The central government will set a quota on provincial bond issues and for 2015 the quota is RMB1 trillion;
∙Projects that have commercial returns, such a metro systems, are to be undertaken by public- private-partnerships (PPPs). There are no official restrictions on the debt issuance of PPPs, but the debt will not be guaranteed by government;
∙Existing debt will also be restructured as part of the reforms, lowering debt servicing costs.
The reforms are a welcome step towards putting local government finances and borrowing onto a sustainable footing. However, the changes bring uncertainty and probable delays to local government investment – for example, the provincial bond issuance quota for this year was only announced in the first half of March. It is also unclear how successful PPPs will be. Clearly there is a risk that local government infrastructure investment falls as a result. With budgets under pressure, local State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) could also curtail investment, employment or some combination of the two if local government funding is withdrawn.
(4) Loss of confidence and capital outflows
China‟s risk profile, its slowing economic growth and its narrowing interest rate premium over the US all make it less attractive to investors. A loss of confidence could trigger large capital outflows, while the ongoing anti-corruption campaign is a second possible driver of capital outflows. An exit of money could hit lending, investment and lead to a further deterioration of confidence levels.
How would the government respond?
President Xi Jinping‟s warnings of the lessons to be learnt from the demise of the Soviet Union‟s communist party make it clear that maintaining the pre-eminence of the Chinese Communist Party is of paramount importance to the leadership. By extension, economic stability – and, more importantly, labour market and social stability – is critical and the government would respond rapidly if one of the above events were to trigger a sudden deceleration in economic growth. CRU believes that the Chinese authorities are well placed to act. That said, we believe that the authorities would respond much more cautiously than was the case in 2008 given the problems that stimulus stored up for the future.
Bail outs: The government would bail out the financial system. In China‟s 1998 banking crisis, banks non- performing loans amounted to 50% of loans outstanding (the funds had predominantly gone to SOEs). The bail-out totalled 47% of GDP. If we assume that 50% of the increase in credit since 2008 is non-performing, a bail out would amount to 36% of GDP and would raise central government debt from 20% of GDP to a comfortably manageable 56%. Looked at another way, the central government could assume responsibility for:
∙All of the debts of local governments, which total 35% of GDP.
∙All trust fund loans. Trusts are a source of concern and defaults would have a large negative impact on confidence as they are typically viewed as being guaranteed by the State. However, at 8% of GDP the government could choose to stand behind trust loans and for 15% of GDP it could take on all of the assets of trust funds – albeit at the expense of reinforcing moral hazard.
China is also in a position to avoid the type of credit crunch that was seen in the developed economies in the 2008 crisis as the government has much more direct control over bank lending.
Interest rates and liquidity: Interest rates can be lowered from current levels which for one year bank loans are in excess of 4% in real terms. Lower interest rates would reduce the cost of servicing existing debt, even if the government prevented an upturn in new credit outstanding. During the years of massive foreign exchange inflows the People‟s Bank of China raised banks Required Reserve Ratios (RRR) - the proportion of deposits that banks must keep in reserve – from 6% in 2003 to a peak of 21% in 2011 to limit the increase in liquidity the inflows would bring. This ratio could be lowered to offset the drain on liquidity of capital outflows.
Government investment: The scope for lowering taxes to boost the economy is limited as tax revenues account for just 19% of GDP. More likely would an increase in government spending, with infrastructure investment to the fore as was the case in 2008 and in response to China‟s banking crisis in
1998. Investment in other priority areas would also be increased, such as social housing, public services and the environment.
Real estate and reforms: Real estate would be at the centre of the crisis but as a cornerstone of the economy is „too big to fail‟. Policies towards real estate would be relaxed, such as lowering mortgage rates, reducing mortgage down payments and easing restrictions on those eligible to buy. Further reform of the urban household registration system (hukou reform) would also be likely. One-third of the urban population, over 250 million people, are migrants that are effectively locked out of the formal housing market and do not
have access to public services such as education and health. Hukou reform would increase the pool of potential property buyers and lift their discretionary spending power. Policies to open sectors of the economy to private participation and investment would also likely be accelerated. SOEs have soaked up credit since 2008, crowding out private enterprises, but SOEs are relatively inefficient and their return on assets has fallen since 2008 and is now less a third of that of the private sector.
Note, in our view the government would not weaken the RMB significantly. Firstly, a depreciating currency would exacerbate capital outflows and the loss of investor confidence. Secondly, in past crisis the RMB has been held flat against the US$. If the RMB were to come under significant market pressure the People‟s Bank has US$4 trillion of foreign currency reserves to draw on and support it.
How long for government policy to have an impact?
The government would respond quickly. Firstly, downside risks to the Chinese economy have been evident for some time and it is likely that the government has contingency plans ready to implement. Secondly, the government‟s response in 2008 was swift: the investment bank Lehman Brothers unexpectedly collapsed on 15th September, triggering the global financial crisis. The Chinese government‟s stimulus was announced on 9th November 2008. GDP growth slowed from 9.7% y/y in 2008Q3 to 6.6% in 2009Q1, but rebounded to 9.7% in 2009Q3 and peaked at 12.4% in 2010Q1 as investment expanded rapidly. The accuracy of the GDP figures is debatable but other indicators which are viewed as more reliable, such as cement production and industrial power consumption show, a similarly speedy turnaround (albeit after larger negative impacts).
That said, CRU sees important differences between now and 2008 that we believe would imply a more muted recovery. The 2008 downturn was caused by events overseas whereas the risks this time are domestically focused and could have a larger negative impact on household and business confidence. Last time the government was able to unleash investment spending which climbed by 22% y/y in 2009 after growth of 9% in 2008, offsetting the collapse in exports. This time investment itself would be the cause of
the crisis and weakness would be harder to offset. Lastly, China allowed a rapid increase in credit last time but will not want to repeat that approach this time.
What would be the economic impact?
Whichever potential trigger initiates the downturn investment would be at the core of it, with real estate and local government funded investment most at risk. As demand from those sectors falters and confidence dives, investment by other industries would also be hit. Similarly, consumer demand for autos and appliances would also be particularly vulnerable as spending on such „big ticket‟ items is relatively easy to postpone and, in any case, is correlated with housing sales.
Industrial production would slow sharply due to weaker demand while destocking would further lower output. However, exports and the demand for non-durable consumer goods, such as food, would hold up relatively well and cushion the downturn. Construction activity, machinery output and consumer durables output would perform worse than the economy overall and real consumption of metals with them. Metals destocking would lower apparent consumption further.
For the purposes of this scenario we assume that the crisis starts in 2015Q2. The largest hit to GDP, investment and industrial production growth rates occur in 2015. The government‟s policy response becomes evident in 2016 and recovering investment lifts industrial output growth which also benefits from re- stocking. Medium term growth rates return towards the base case but, in line with international experience that financially driven downturns result in a permanent loss of output , the level of activity does not regain the levels seen in the base case. In 2019 GDP is 3% smaller than in the base case (a loss of US$385bn), investment over 4% smaller and industrial production over 3% smaller. We would also expect to see the composition of credit and investment to evolve in the medium term. The government‟s initial response to a downturn would be to boost State-funded investment, but also to accelerate reforms. Beneficiaries of reforms would be private sector businesses which would see improved access to credit. Households would also see improved access to credit, allowing them to lower the proportion of income they save and lift
consumption. Household finances are lightly leveraged: mortgages outstanding account for just 17% of GDP and could be safely increased.
Why is the impact not bigger?
Compared to the experience of many developed economies in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and of that of a range of emerging markets in earlier crises, China appears to escape lightly in our scenario. After all, in their study of economic crises in 190 countries the economists Cerra and Saxena studied found that banking crisis in countries with a similar income level to China resulted in a loss of GDP relative to trend of around 12% on average (and a range of 8% to 18%) – their results for Asian countries show similar results.
A key difference of China to many other countries is that the Chinese government retains a very powerful role in the economy which will enable it to act quickly and directly support spending and the flow of credit. Most importantly, however, rather than exploding in a short space of time China‟s financial crisis is playing out in slow motion and to a large extent is already captured in our base case forecasts. Indeed, restructuring of local government debt is already happening, while regulation of shadow banking has increased over the past year and reform of inefficient, capital absorbing SOEs is beginning.
Conclusion
China plays a pivotal role in global commodity markets and it is understandable that worries over the country‟s economic prospects can quickly escalate and become the focal point for markets. China faces major economic challenges that will remain with us over a five year horizon and longer. A significant downturn in growth centred on the metal intensive segments of the economy, as we have outlined in this White Paper, is a very real downside risk.
If there were a sudden deceleration in economic growth, CRU believes the Chinese government would respond quickly and decisively. The government will have contingency plans ready to implement and these plans would reverse steep declines in GDP and IP within 12-18 months. As a consequence, although there
would be a permanent loss of output to the Chinese economy, it would be at far lower levels than experienced by many economies after the 2008 crisis.
It is easy to forget that China is still a developing country with massive scope for economic growth. By 2025 we expect the Chinese economy to be 90% larger in real terms than it was in 2014 – a gain equivalent
to today‟s US$ size of the economies of Germany, Italy, Turkey, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and
Thailand combined. We are right to be worried about China in the short-term, but the economy still has massive growth potential into the longer-term.
