ANALYSIS
Firm UAN values prompt Abu Qir to issue tender
UAN
Continued, albeit slower, sales of UAN-30 at €196-197/mt FCA in France and leftover demand from Spain likely encouraged Abu Qir to issue its June 23 sales tender for 10,000 mt UAN-32 for prompt loading. It is expected to achieve returns above $180/mt FOB following 36,000 mt sales to Helm and Koch at the end of April priced just below that marker.
GrodnoAzot reportedly managed to achieve $170/mt FOB in its 25,000 mt June 12 export tender. Some tonnage is suggested destined for France while the balance will be loaded to nearby markets from the plant by rail.
US movement of UAN continues to disappoint, but the culprit still is wet weather. Assuming conditions improve again before the corn grows too tall, UAN applications still could meet expectations, but summer fill orders likely will be delayed while retailers and distributors are uncertain about their carryover volumes.
Ammonium sulphate
At least 36,000 mt caprolactam grade AS has been sold by Chinese suppliers to Koch and Trammo with some small container business to Ameropa this week. The Koch tonnage will likely be directed to Indonesia against previous sales to Gresik.
Petrokimia Gresik is seeking further product and has issued a tender closing June 22 for 10-15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for first half August arrival.
In the Black Sea steel grade AS values have declined at least $5/mt on a reported 4,000 mt purchase by Mekatrade. Turkey has been suggested as the cargo destination.
Eurochem has fixed a 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS ex-Antwerp sale into Turkey, possibly to Gubretas in combination with 25,000 mt DAP. No further details are known. Turkish caprolactam grade AS prices are pegged in the high $160s/mt CFR duty paid.
European caprolactam grade AS has been sold into Brazil at $175/mt CFR while Chinese product has achieved values in the high $160s/mt CFR.
Ammonium nitrate/CAN
FSU suppliers continue to aim for higher netbacks from key markets such as Brazil and Turkey, but sales around an even $210/mt FOB and marginally higher are so far limited to smaller parcels for North Africa.
Suggestions that Brazilian buyers had concluded parcles of AN in combination with phosphates and urea at prices providing suppliers with netbacks above $215/mt FOB for AN could not be verified.
MARKETS
UAN
NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: Barges flat, but pressure from imports
UAN barge trades have not been the priority for up-river buyers due to continuing rain in the Midwest. However, once further demand emerges for corn application sales of full tows should re-emerge. As a result nearby indications are unchanged from last week.
Meanwhile, Agronova is loading 40,000 mt of UAN-32 July 1-10 from the Baltic for the US Gulf. The cargo is destined for Gavilon under a previously agreed supply arrangement. Market sources suggested the delivered price paid by Gavilon will result in a cost in a barge as low as $197/st FOB New Orleans..
US Midwest: Fill offers put pressure on prompt market
As expected, lower fill offers that include delivery dates as early as July have begun to drag down UAN values in the Midwest. Prompt UAN is on offer from some river terminals as low as $9.06/unit FOB this week, while even the high end of the market has fallen to about $9.38/unit from some inland locations.
The new prompt price range is down roughly $0.20/unit at both ends compared to prior weeks. This follows reports earlier this month of Q3 fill offers at $7.66-7.81/unit FOB in the region. While the volume available at this level is relatively modest, it means the prompt market likely will decline further as June comes an end.

Belarus: GrodnoAzot sells 25,000 mt UAN-32
Contrary to earlier reports, GrodnoAzot said it sold 25,000 mt UAN-32 following its June 12 export tender. The product to load onto vessels was reported secured at $170/mt FOB, destined for France while tonnage destined for Ukraine will be loaded from the plant by rail.
EUROPE
France: Values stable on small number of sales
Sales into France continue to be slow around the €196-197/mt FCA marker. Some traders continue to push for €200/mt FCA but so far this has not been successful.
Demand from farmers is expected to decrease over the next few weeks as their focus is shifted to harvesting the winter wheat crop. A lack of rainfall is causing some concern, with wheat and rapeseed yields in the central part of the country down 10-15% from last year’s high level with the potential to decrease further if rain does not fall over the coming weeks.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Abu Qir issues 10,000 mt UAN tender
Abu Qir issued an export tender closing June 23 for 10,000 mt UAN-32 for prompt loading.
Helm and Koch secured a total of 36,000 mt from the supplier at the end of April, priced just below $180/mt FOB.

NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: More Chinese AS booked for US Gulf
A panamax of granular ammonium sulphate plus other products is loading this month from China for Gavilon. Specific volume breakdowns were not clear at press time, but in addition to AS, the vessel is carrying industrial grade AS and phosacid carried in drums.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Number of caprolactam grade AS deals fixed
European caprolactam grade AS has been sold into Brazil at $175/mt CFR while Chinese product has achieved values in the high $160s/mt CFR.
Granular AS prices are pegged at $235/mt CFR.
The latest ANDA data reveals January-May imports of both grades AS grew 15% to 845,731 mt. Recent issues in gaining access to credit have taken their toll though, as April and May import figures are down 24% and 17% respectively.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Mekatrade buys steel grade parcel
Mekatrade has reportedly secured a small Black Sea steel grade AS parcel at $127-128/mt FOB, possibly for sale into Turkey.
No caprolactam grade AS sales are believed concluded.
EUROPE
Turkey: EuroChem concludes AS sale
EuroChem has fixed a 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS ex-Antwerp sale into Turkey, in combination with 25,000 mt DAP, possibly to Gubretas. No further details are known.

ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Caprolactam grade AS sales concluded
Chinese caprolactam grade AS has changed hands at $133-135/mt FOB with 26,000 mt reported sold to Koch by several suppliers to cover prior business concluded in Indonesia. Trammo also secured 10,000 mt at the lower end of the range for July lifting while some container business was also fixed by Ameropa.
Indonesia: Petrokimia Gresik issues new AS tender
Petrokimia Gresik issued a tender closing June 22 for 10,000-15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for first half August arrival.

Russia: AN exports down in April
Exports of ammonium nitrate (AN) from Russia in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 216,000 mt were down by 26.3% on April 2014.
Deliveries to Brazil of 114,000 mt were nevertheless up by 12.6% and shipments to Peru of 20,000 mt were up by 7.6%. Turkey accounted for a mere 4,900 mt, down by a full 71% on April 2014.
January-April exports of 1.06 million mt were up by 6.5% on the same period in 2014, with Brazil up by a massive 98.5% to 536,000 mt, more than replacing the volume lost in Ukraine due to anti-dumping measures. Peru accounted for 79,000 mt, up by 16% while deliveries to Turkey of 69,000 mt were down by 18%. Shipments to Morocco of 52,000 mt were up by 8.3%.
