Urea
Production
China’s prill urea output was 777kt during the fourth week of June, down by 3.85% from the week before. Granular output was down slightly by 1.59%, reaching 165.2kt. According to statistics of 1 July, daily urea output was 185.4kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 72.18%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 79.67%, while gas-based producers’ average is 54.17%.
Domestic market
Domestic urea prices continued to slide in many areas; distributors remained cautious. The main urea inventories
are stable, and sales go on normally.
In North China, Hebei Province urea markets were slack overall, and prices were reduced a bit. Some local urea makers sent product to Northeast China. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Hebei are $271-274/t. East China’s urea markets started to weaken; the local agricultural demand in Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces is sluggish. Affected by frequent rainfall, the fertilizer application period has been postponed. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $277-282/t. In Central China’s Hubei Province, urea markets stayed weak; new orders from local customers were not ideal. The wait-and-see atmosphere is predominant. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $282-287/t.
Urea inventories in the main seaports amount to 595,000 tons, up 45,000 tons from last week; of that, 320,000 tons

Raw materials
Domestic anthracite markets kept steady; the main coal companies’ sales are still slack. Demand is far below expectations. North China coal markets kept running normally on the whole, local governments acted to maintain stable anthracite prices. The main coal producers there have no plans to adjust prices. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $123-127/t in Yangquan and Jincheng, the same as last week. In Central China, Henan Province anthracite demand remained too weak to support the local coal market; middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices stayed stable: $151/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $152/t in Yongcheng.
Southwest China’s anthracite markets are almost unchanged; sales were still depressed overall. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $123/t.
Ammonium Sulfate
Domestic ammonium sulfate market prices rose a bit in some areas; domestic demand is the key factor influencing price adjustments. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 68.7% average operating rate, down 0.1% from last week; caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers are operating at about 68% on average, the same as last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $90-102/t in Shanxi Province, $102-106/t in Hebei Province, $105-113/t in East China, $97-105/t in Northeast China, and $90-100/t in Southwest China.

Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.
Domestic phosphate
DAP – Domestic DAP markets kept steady. Most DAP makers are working on export orders, and those orders can last to the end of July, so they feel no sales pressure.
Central China DAP markets were steady, with producers operating at around 70% and keeping comfortable inventory levels. Export was still the focus. Most producers have orders that can last to the end of this month. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Hubei Province stayed at $435/t for DAP with 64% content, and delivered prices for North and East China destinations are $460-468/t for DAP with 64% content, the same as last week. Southwest China’s DAP makers also attended to export markets. Mainstream FOB prices for DAP with 64% content are $465/t for Indian destinations, $472-473/t for Southeast Asian destinations, and $480/t for destinations in Pakistan.

In Central China, Hubei Province’s MAP spot markets were in short supply; granular MAP products were mainly sent to export markets. Prices stayed stable on the whole. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $347/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $371-379/t for powder MAP with 60% content, almost the same as last week.
Southwest China MAP makers continued to maintain low operating rates for powder MAP units, and some of them switched over to granular MAP products. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan Province are $331-339/t for powder MAP with 55% content, $339-347/t for granular MAP with 55% content and $355/t for powder MAP with 60% content.
East China’s MAP prices kept steady because of stable demand; there were plenty of orders. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $358/t for powder MAP with 55% content and $395/t for power MAP with 60% content in Shandong Province.
The main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 145,000 tons, the same as last week, including 40,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port, 20,000 tons Beihai Port and 55,000 tons in Nanjing Port.

International phosphate
Global phosphate markets have the mixed directions at early July after long period stable. USA export values have slipped down to low $470s/t fob Tampa, but there is the continued shipments of MAP to Latin America, and DAP to India. For US local market, the NOLA DAP price continues firm at last level of $430/short ton barges. Russia exporters begin to quote a bit lower prices, mainly for the bigger MAP volumes to Brazil, at the low $470s/t fob Baltic. For other markets such as Europe, the DAP price also is down a small amount, but still above the level $500/t fob North Africa. Still there is no production of the DAP in Tunisia. For this reason, there is strong business for Morocco in Turkey market. For Asia, India prices are in minor decline for India in high $470s/t cfr. Pakistan is not in market after big purchasing in June.
Raw materials
Sulfur: Domestic sulfur markets are on the upswing because international sulfur prices rose a bit. In some regions, refineries overhauled or limited production to maintain low sulfur inventories. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $174-189/t in Northeast China, $195-210/t in North China, $190-202/t in East China, $182-293/t in South China and $195-206/t in Southwest China.
Imported sulfur products in the ports are concentrated in the hands of a few prominent traders; they are optimistic about the sulfur market and are in no rush to sell their goods. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 940,000 tons of sulfur on hand, down 3,000 tons from last week, with 330,000 tons in Nantong Port, 70,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 140,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 70,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 38,000 tons in Beihai Port and 240,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.
Sulfur Price and Inventory
Note: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.
Phosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets were stable on the whole; sales in the main areas were disappointing, but prices stayed unchanged. Guizhou Province phosphate rock markets adjusted slightly. Some rock mines remained idle due to the previous rainfall. Resuming production will depend on the weather. FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock market prices fluctuated little; mainstream rock prices are $42-45/t for 28% content at Mabian, $35/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock
Page 5
markets were stable; rock prices there are $42/t for 28% content. In Central China, Hubei Province producers maintained low mining rates. Rock prices are unchanged: $65-77/t for 28-30% content in Yichang.
(15-15-15). In Central China, Henan Province NPK markets were in a short off season; NPK makers overhauled for 1-2 weeks. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $306/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).
NPK
Domestic NPK – Domestic NPK makers have announced their autumn fertilizer policies and prices gradually. They are concerned about high raw material prices. The new NPK prices are higher. Mainstream prices are $323-339/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In East China’s Shandong Province, autumn fertilizer sales began. Mainstream new ex-factory prices there are $306-323/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $355-371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In North China, Hebei Province’s NPK markets remained flat. The local producers kept prices unchanged. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $290-306/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $347/t for SOP-NPK

Malaysia and Indonesia. This is on the weak currency exchange for Ringgit and Rupiah. Also Vietnam imports are going on, but prices stay flat at $330/t cfr. In the West markets, the granular MOP trade goes slow. In Brazil now, the price of imported granular MOP re-stabilizes in the area of mid $320s/t cfr. So far the intention for supplier increase is proposed but not achieved after market competition
continues. In the USA, an important price instance is reached after domestic pre-season program prices are announced at $355pst fob. The NOLA market is flat in range $315-320/short ton fob barge. For Europe, the standard MOP are in range €260-275/t cfr, and granular MOP in range €295-300/t cfr according to the cargo size. K+S eventually has rejected PotashCorp bid for take-over.

New Fertilizer Project in China
1) Urea Project (1000tpy, Product)
Note: some new projects have been completed in 2011, and were delayed to put into production to 2012, such as Guodian Chifeng, Guizhou Jinchi, Jinxin Chemical, Kuitun Jinjiang Chemical and Yangmei Heshun.
We revised the 2011’s table and put these projects into 2012’s table. In addition, 520k tons of urea capacity of Inner Mongolia Tianrun has been delayed to 2013 due to uncertain factors. So the actual new capacity of urea in 2011 putting into production was 3.14m tons.
