ANALYSIS
Suppliers attempt to recover potash prices across the globe
Prices in the potash spot markets are largely unchanged this week as suppliers attempt to recover reductions across many markets so far in 2015. Suppliers had hoped that the $10/mt increase in contract prices in both China and India would help to increase waning prices, particularly in Brazil and the US, but so far this has not been the case.
Brazil is where most suppliers have set their sights in order to improve prices. The potash price in the country has fallen by as much as $40-50/mt in the first half of 2015 due mainly to low agricultural commodity prices, weak demand and credit issues amongst farmers.
New credit is set to reach farmers in early July and demand is building towards the autumn season, causing suppliers to plan price rises step by step through the coming months.
Brazilian imports improved in May but remain down 25% in the year so far, according to new ANDA data. Brazil imported
2.8million mt potash between January and May, a near 1 million mt fall on the previous year, but May potash imports increased 6.1% to 788,888 mt. Brazilian prices remain in the range of $330-$340/mt CFR with suppliers united at $340- $350/mt CFR range for July deliveries, before moving towards $355/mt CFR in August. Achieving some kind of increase during the third quarter is likely, but Brazil is unlikely to close 2015 at the $380/mt CFR level achieved last year.
Southeast Asian prices remain in the $300-345/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia with the low end seen in Malaysia, which remains a difficult market for potash sales. Similarly, some suppliers have increased prices to around $330/mt CFR for both Malaysia and Indonesia, but these levels are yet to be achieved. With currency depreciation, low palm oil prices and good stock levels in Malaysia particularly, achieving the price target will be a difficult task.
In the US, action has largely grinded to a halt with the market out of season. Some potash movement remains for crops other than corn but postings have further reduced to $345-365/st FOB with distributors looking for as low as $350/st FOB. At New Orleans, barges were last seen at $320-325/mt FOB and suppliers say this level supports recent fill offers for the US interior.
The European and Chinese domestic markets also remain out of season with little activity. Granular potash deals remain in the range of €300-310/mt CIF in northwest Europe but suppliers are said to be targeting price increases to around the €315/mt CIF level after discussions with buyers at this week's Prague Conference. In China port wholesale prices remain in the RMB 2,000-2,120/mt FCA range with activity unlikely to build up until nearer the autumn season.
ICL and K+S are expected to announce their contract deals to India shortly, which, if at similar levels to last year, should bring total firm volumes to around 4.2 million mt. Factoring in optional volumes, spot deals and any further tenders through the year, Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014's 4.2 million mt.
The $10/mt increase in China and India, along with increased demand to both countries, must now be seen as an achievement for suppliers. It remains to be seen whether significant price increases in Brazil, Southeast Asia and Europe can be achieved by the end of the year, but with price discipline less prevalent than in previous years, it is likely to be a difficult task.

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.
MARKETS
MOP
NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: Seasonal demand done, prices flat
There are few expectations for prompt demand, and suppliers note that values for granular potash already have fallen to a level that supports recent fill offers for the US interior markets. Prior barge trades were claimed at $320-325/st FOB New Orleans.
US Midwest: Only marginal demand remains
Some potash movement to retailers remains for crops other than corn, but even most of the soybean planting has been completed at this stage. Postings generally have moved to around $365/st FOB, but more and more distributors report retailers have no need to buy prompt tons unless they are offered in line with summer fill values around $350/st FOB.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Imports improve in May but remain down 25% -
ANDA
Brazil imported 2.8 million mt potash between January and May, a 25% fall (930,000 mt) year on year, according to the latest ANDA data.
The majority of the reduction in imports took place between February and April, while in May potash imports increased 6.1% to 788,888 mt.
Earlier this month, GTIS data showed that Brazil imported 2.3 million mt between January and May, a 30% fall.
During the period, Canpotex reduced volumes to Brazil by 29% to 646,000 mt, BPC cut volumes by 43% to 434,000 mt and Uralkali curbed volumes by 40% to 398,000 mt. K+S sent 388,000 mt, ICL sent 358,000 mt (with almost half coming from its Spanish and UK operations) and SQM sent 106,000 mt, according to GTIS.
Currency depreciation, weak agricultural prices and credit issues in Brazil have forced down farmer demand and caused a drop in spot prices amid strong competition in Brazil.
Brazil: Suppliers await demand build up
Prices in Brazil remain in the range of $330-$340/mt CFR with suppliers united at higher levels in the $340- $350/mt CFR range for July deliveries.
BPC confirmed that it has reached an agreement for a 60,000 mt delivery at $340/mt CFR in July. Currently there are limited deals as buyers react to the price increases and many made at the upper end of the range are believed to include some kind of rebate.
Uralkali is said to be sold out for June deliveries and has set a price of $345/mt CFR for July deals. BPC, ICL and Canpotex have priced June and July deliveries at $340-345/mt CFR while SQM is expected to offer at least $340/mt CFR for July deliveries and could raise its prices to as high as $350/mt CFR.
Buyers have indicated some level of acceptance for higher prices but with stocks said to be pretty high and with corn prices continuing to fall below cost-of-production levels, worries remain over whether significant price increases in the $15-25/mt CFR level by the end of August can be achieved.
Suppliers hope that farmers will increase buying once new lines of credit are given on July 1 and that worries of higher delays during autumn at the Brazilian ports may push for an influx of buying in July and August.
Latin America: Uralkali agrees three shipments above $340/mt CFR
Uralkali signed three shipments to Latin American countries outside of Brazil for June delivery at $340- 350/mt CFR levels.
A vessel carrying 20,000 mt granular potash is being delivered to Colombia and Guatemala, a shipment of 10,000 mt of granular potash is heading to Uruguay and a shipment of 15,000 mt of gMOP and 5,000 mt of sMOP is set for June delivery in Colombia and Ecuador.
EUROPE
Europe: Suppliers look for price push in Europe
Potash activity is seasonally slow in Europe and granular potash deals remain in the €300-310/mt CIF NW Europe range with very few deals reported.
Suppliers are said to have put forward to buyers possible European price increases during this week's Prague Conference. ICL are said to be selling higher than €310/mt CIF while Uralkali is now looking for €315/mt CIF for granular potash from July 1.
In recent weeks there has been growth regarding standard potash deals from larger buyers with news of possible tightness in the standard market, as Belaruskali produces high levels of granular product and large quantities of standard potash is sent to India and China on new contracts.
Generally standard potash is said to be traded in the €275-285/mt CIF range with deals for larger buyers quoted at the €275/mt CIF level.
Belarus: BPC expects flat or higher potash export revenues in 2015
BPC expects full year 2015 export revenue to be no worse than last year and possibly better, the company's Director General Elena Kudryavets told RIA Novosti on July 16.
The company increased its exports of potash by 66% in 2014 to 9.5 million mt compared to 2013 as BPC recovered from the break-up of its alliance with Russian producer Uralkali in 2013.
The announcement does not necessarily mean the company plans to export more in 2015 as higher levels of potash have been contracted to China and India by BPC at higher prices than last year. However, reduced spot prices in some markets such as Malaysia and Brazil may mean the company has to export more to achieve higher export revenues.
Kudryavets said that BPC is currently supplying more than 100 countries, with the majority going to India, China, Brazil, Southeast Asia and Europe. However, the company also began exporting to the US this year for the first time since 2008.
She added that BPC expects total volume of potash deliveries in 2015 to fall to 59-61 million mt this year.
BPC gets its potash from Belaruskali which produced a total of 10.3 million mt of potash in 2015. Belaruskali increased production in Q1 by 9% year on year to 2.6 million mt and has been producing at very high rates during Q2, pushing back planned maintenance at its RU#2 and RU#3 units until later in the year if at all in 2015.
With possible higher exports from BPC and higher potash production necessary for Belaruskali's increasing NPK operations, Belaruskali is likely to surpass the 10.3 million mt it produced in 2014 and may become the largest individual potash producer this year in the wake of the loss of Uralkali's SK-2 mine in November 2014.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Shipments build up on contract deals
More than 150,000 mt potash is scheduled to arrive in India in the next week as volumes from new contracts signed between major suppliers and buyers in India begin to filter into the market.
Potash arriving this week comprises seven shipments from Uralkali, APC and BPC. Uralkali sent three cargoes totalling 72,000 mt to Shriram, Zuari and IPL, APC sent two shipments totalling 30,600 mt to Zuari and BPC sent 54,000 mt to Chambal and IPL.
The new volumes bring total June shipments up to 264,070 mt, according to new port data.
Some volumes in the RCF tender for 145,000 mt firm and 120,000 mt optional potash, which closed on May 7 and was awarded to BPC, are also likely to soon arrive in the country.
In India, BPC recently agreed volumes in excess of the 700,000 mt sent in the previous fertilizer year, Canpotex closed deals for 1.3 million, APC signed 505,000 mt and Uralkali agreed deals for 800,000 mt. There are rumours that K+S signed around 150,000 mt to India, most likely with IPL, which means only ICL is yet to announce its quantities.
If ICL signs volumes around the 700,000 mt it sent last year then the total volumes sent to India should be around 4.2 million mt. Factoring in optional volumes, spot deals and any further tenders through the year, Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014's 4.2 million mt.
Sri Lanka: MoA announces potash tender
Sri Lanka's Ministry of Agriculture has announced a tender for 28,700 mt of standard potash, closing on 29 June.
In February, the MoA's last tender for 24,000 mt potash was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd. with Uralkali tonnage after they made an offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit. The product was delivered in May.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: Prices remain weak as suppliers hold offers
Southeast Asian prices remain in the $300-345/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia with the low end seen in Malaysia, which remains a difficult market for potash sales.
Last week, two tenders totalling 15-20,000 mt were sold at the very weak $300/mt CFR level in Malaysia, likely by local traders selling off stocks, and sources say that it's difficult to make any deals above $305/mt CFR currently. Some suppliers are holding prices around $330/mt CFR in Malaysia and hope that price discipline can push up the Malaysian potash price.
Malaysia has turned out to be a very difficult market for sellers so far in 2015. The ringgit has weakened 15% against the dollar in the last 12 months, palm oil prices remain at low levels, demand is weaker than some expectations and some sources highlight quite strong stocks. All these factors mean that competition is abundant in the country and prices have been weak so far in 2015. The Malaysian market is unlikely to build up now until August, ahead of the November season.
In Indonesia, the sMOP market is believed to be trading as low as $320/mt CFR but suppliers are now said to be offering no less than $330/mt CFR, with no deals yet confirmed at that level.
Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam are quoted in the $330-345/mt CFR range with very few deals at the upper end and only for very small volumes.
China: Potash activity remains slow with reduced imports
The Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow, with imports reduced so far in June.
Mainstream standard potash deals have generally been concluded in the RMB 2,020-2,100 ($325-338/mt) FCA range with some small volumes still trading at RMB 2,000/mt FCA. Small quantities of the 62% K2O white MOP are still said to have been purchased at RMB 2,120/mt FCA.
June imports have so far been slow, particularly for rail cross border imports which are estimated to be lower than 100,000 mt this month. May potash imports are believed to have been quite low, at roughly 550,000 mt, which would be a 41% fall on May 2014 imports and around 300,000 mt lower than in April.
Most sources in China expect that with the market off-season, some contracted imports are being postponed and the market should build up in the coming months ahead of the autumn season.
South Korea: Potash imports up 70% in May
South Korea imported 79,000 mt of potash in May, a 70% increase year on year and the highest May imports since 2011, according to GTIS.
During the month, 76% of the volumes or 60,000 mt came from Canpotex, while South Korea imported 13,000 mt from BPC and around 6,000 mt from Laos' producers.
Between January and May, South Korea imported 312,453 mt of potash, a 5.8% increase year on year and the highest potash imports for this period since 2005. During the five-month period, South Korea imported 71% or 222,000 mt from Canpotex, 68,000 mt from BPC and 21,210 mt from Laos (surpassing volumes from Laos for the whole of 2014).
SOP
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Two small SOP tenders announced
RCF has announced a tender for 2-3,000 mt SOP closing next week on June 22 while IFFCO has announced a tender for 2,000 mt closing at the end of this week, June 19.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: SDIC Luobupo produces strongly ahead of maintenance
Chinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo produced around 150,000 mt of SOP in May, according to sources, bringing its January to May production to 850,000 mt.
January-April volumes were up 7% year on year at 696,000 mt and product seems to be continuing in this vein.
The company is planning to close its operations for regular summer maintenance between the end of June and the end of August.
Some big buyers are believed to be purchasing SOP ahead of the maintenance dates, with prices seen around RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT and SDIC cargoes should be sold out shortly.
The price represents a RMB 350/mt fall compared to SDIC's February 27 pricelist but some distributors expect the SOP price will strengthen while SDIC is down for maintenance due to the planned decline in output.
NPKS
EUROPE
Europe: NPK suppliers soon to set new prices
The European NPK market continues to see little activity but with demand building and significantly higher netbacks for producers sending NPKs to Asia particularly, suppliers are expected to set higher prices in Europe shortly.
European NPK buyers are bidding around the $310-320/mt FOB level for Baltic Sea 15-15-15, but suppliers see these prices as far too low and new prices are likely to be at least $335/mt FOB when producers set their new season offers. For now, Baltic Sea 15-15-15 deals continue to be quoted in the range $320-335/mt FOB.
Belarus: NPK exports flat January-April
Belarus exported 211,000 mt NPKs between January and April, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.
Belarus sent 76,000 mt to Lithuania (with much of this volume re-exported), 60,000 mt to Poland and 36,000 mt to Ukraine, where import duty for Belarusian NPKs was suspended in August last year.
In the first quarter, Belarus exported 184,000 mt NPKs, a 10% increase year on year but in the month of April NPK exports fell 38% to 29,000 mt, with the majority of the exports going to Ukraine.
Belaruskali continues to expand its NPK production capability after launching its first NPK capacity in April, 2013. Last year the potash producer exported 181,700 mt NPKs, with 27,900 mt coming from its RU-1 facility and 153,800 mt from its RU-3 facility, which ramped up production capacity during 2014 to roughly 240,000 mt.
The company is planning to ramp up NPK production to as high as 720,000 mt/year in the coming years through the introduction of new NPK lines.
In 2014, Belarus exported almost 600,000 mt NPKs of which 34% went to Lithuania, 29% to Poland and 17% to Ukraine.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Nigeria: Industry suffers over lack of subsidy decision
Nigeria's fertilizer industry is currently paralysed by a lack for clarity over the future subsidy regime since President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29.
The current subsidy is 50% under the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) shared between the federal and state governments, according to the Fertilizer Producers & Suppliers Association of Nigeria (Fepsan).
"We have no idea of the rate and when it will happen," Fepsan Executive Secretary Ahmed Rabiu Kwa told Fertilizer Week. Suppliers are apprehensive and are holding off even though the farming season has begun, he said.
Nigeria currently imports 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 from a range of suppliers for use mostly on cereal crops. The industry body estimates potential NPK demand growth at 10% per annum and assesses the average NPK import price currently at $350/mt CFR.
OCP recently said it is planning on sending 60,000 mt of NPKs to Africa in June, mostly 15-15-15 for Nigeria, and indicated $330/mt FOB for sales into the African markets. OCP is currently discussing July shipments for Nigeria but nothing has yet been booked.
Fertilizer re-exports to neighbouring countries are prohibited by law.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
Allana shareholders approve ICL takeover
At a meeting of shareholders this week, Allana Potash Corp has agreed to approve the company's acquisition by Israeli potash producer ICL.
Allana Potash's flagship asset is in the Danakhil evaporite basin, part of the Dallol region of the Afar province of Ethiopia.
Under the agreement, most Allana shareholders will receive $0.50 in cash per Allana share while some will receive the equivalent of $0.50 in shares of ICL for each Allana share exchanged.
The takeover was approved by 96% of the votes cast by securityholders and 90% of the company's shareholders who were allowed to take part.
ICL, which currently holds a 16.36% share in Allana, offered a total of around CAD 137 million ($111 million) for Allana in March, arguing that the takeover would suit its strategy to broaden its sources of raw materials globally while reducing its production costs and focusing on high growth emerging markets.
Earlier this year, Allana announced a preliminary economic assessment for the site which showed an after- tax net present value of $1.6 billion based on annual production of one million mt of SOP over an estimated operating life of 77 years. Allana wanted to secure financing for necessary construction by mid-2015 to begin building a mine next year. MOP production was slated begin by 2018 with SOP production the following year.
ICL plans to accelerate pre-construction engineering work, secure project financing and reduce the company's risks associated with the project.
The takeover deal is expected to close on June 22, subject to certain conditions.

MagIndustries reveals evidence of alleged bribery
Potash junior MagIndustries has announced the resignation of its auditor and has commenced a delisting review as an internal investigation finds evidence of bribes totalling several thousand dollars were paid by its subsidiaries to Congolese officials.
In January, MagIndustries was prompted to carry out an internal investigation after Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched their offices. The RCMP have not laid yet any charges against MagIndustries
The Toronto-based company said in a news release that there is evidence to show that its wholly-owned subsidiary Eucalyptus Fibre de Congo made four payments totalling as much as $76,500 to inspectors and officials in Congo to reduce EFC's debts and taxes.
MagIndustries is still investigating a fifth alleged bribe, which took place in 2013.
However, due to a lack of funding from its largest shareholder, MagIndustries has had to dissolve the committee investigating the allegations, many of which involved the development of MagIndustries 90% owned Mengo potash mining project in the Republic of Congo. The Congolese government holds the other 10%.
MagIndustries said that its controlling shareholder, Evergreen Holding Group, has informed it that it cannot cover the millions of Canadian dollars involved as expenses to continue the investigation but will seek funds to do so.
In the meantime, four directors, including three on the special committee, have resigned from MagIndustries and its chief financial officer has been suspended. In addition, Richey Morrow has been appointed its co- chief executive officer along with current CEO Longbo Chen.
Ernst & Young has resigned as the auditor for the company effective June 16, concluding that in their professional judgment they cannot complete MagIndustries' consolidated financial statements for 2014 in accordance with professional standards.
"Any resumption of the investigation will depend on the appointment of new independent directors and on the controlling shareholder raising sufficient funds to fund such resumption," MagIndustries said.
The company also announced that it is reviewing the possibility of delisting from the Toronto Stock Exchange. If the company is unable to demonstrate on or before 17 July that it meets TSX's requirements for continued listing, it will be forced to delist.
MagIndustries had been in talks earlier this year with major Chinese potash producer Qinghai Salt Lake over a possible investment by QSL in the Mengo project but with the bribery investigation ongoing, any investment is unlikely at this point.
The company also confirmed in January that a Letter of Commitment from November 2013 made by the China Development Bank for the majority of funding for construction of the Mengo project remains active. The delay in approval of the loan is due to more conservative lending environment and tighter fiscal controls in China, MagIndustries remarked, but finalising the loan remains indefinitely delayed.
The site's potential deposit reserve is estimated at 33.2 million mt of potash, which the company intends to sell into markets in Asia, Europe and South America.

Sirius Minerals shares hit as planning report sees policy clash
North York Moors National Park Authority's planning committee for Sirius Minerals' York Potash development has highlighted certain problems with the application but have yet to make a decision on whether it should go ahead.
The company's shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 28% on 18 June.
The report says that while there is an economic case for the mine, "the application has a clear and
fundamental conflict with both local and national policies… The greater public interest is considered to be that of the statutory National Park purposes which protect the North York Moors."
Building such a large mine in a national park clashes with current policy guidelines, the report said, and Sirius' consultants have underestimated the environmental effects of some details of the plan.
However, the report also said that there is "very strong local support" for the mine, the economic impacts could be of "national significance" and that mitigation plans put in place by Sirius "go a long way towards moderating the impact" of the mine.
Sirius disagrees with certain policy interpretations reached by the committee and that the project is in the public interest due to "the substantial scale of the benefits and extent to which the environmental effects have been mitigated or compensated for," the company said.
"Responsibility for balancing the various issues related to this application rests with the members of the Authority and we believe the case for approval is very strong because the Project represents a once in a generation opportunity," Chief Executive Chris Fraser said.
The report did not include any recommendation, leaving this up to a special planning committee on June 30. If the special committee cannot come to a decision then the application could be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, which could delay the process for as long as nine months.
The decision had already been delayed until May from the start of this year and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council has already given the go ahead for the section of the MTS in its jurisdiction.
All of the other major approvals have been given apart from Sirius' application for harbour facilities, which is currently being examined by the planning inspectorate.
The company is planning a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.
Danakali set for Colluli Definitive Feasibility Study in Q3
Danakali Ltd, formerly South Boulder Mines, has submitted the last set of its social and environmental assessments for the Colluli potash project to the Eritrean Ministry of Mines and Energy.
The assessments will be used to develop both social and environmental management plans, which will be submitted after the site's definitive feasibility study is completed, currently estimated to be in Q3 2015.
In May, the company announced a 1.1 billion mt maiden ore reserve estimate at 10% K2O equivalent at Colluli. The estimate was based on a 287 million mt proved ore reserve and an 820 million mt probable ore reserve at the Eritrean site, with over 85% of its measured and indicated resource included in the estimate.
The company said the site is capable of producing SOP, SOP-M and MOP and the reserve could last more than 200 years based on modeled production rates in its recent pre-feasibility study (PFS).
In March, South Boulder announced a PFS for the Colluli project. The study showed that with open pit mining the project would have initial production output of 425,000 mt/year of SOP in 2018, increasing to 850,000 mt/year from year five.
Potash West commissions Ercosplan
Potash junior Potash West has brought on German consultants and engineers Ercosplan to oversee technical operations in its South Harz project in Thuringia, Central Germany.
The site requires further drilling to upgrade its resource to JORC standards and the consultants believe that a maximum of three drill holes are necessary to upgrade the project's resource.
Potash West and Ercosplan are now planning the new drill holes and are carrying our discussions with drilling contractors.
The Kullstedt part of the licence currently holds a large exploration target of 4 to 5 billion mt of potash ore at a grade of between 7 and 25% K2O.
East Exploration Pty Ltd, in which Potash West has a 55% stake, owns the South Harz project.
In May, Potash West said it may sell 100% of the South Harz project to Petratherm Ltd but parties decided not to proceed with the deal. Potash West and East Exploration are now looking at other opportunities to achieve a similar outcome.
PhosAgro launches new bulk terminal
Russian phosphate producer PhosAgro has now commissioned Smart Bulk Terminal, its new fertilizer terminal at Ust-Luga on the Gulf of Finland.
The opening ceremony for the new terminal, which has a capacity of over 1.5 million mt of mineral fertilizers/year and 80,000 mt of fertilizer storage space, took place on July 16.
The project is considered unique because handling and storage facilities can be doubled in a short time period and fertilizers are unloaded from railcars at the site onto specialised sea-shipping containers designed for quick loading and unloading.
At present the Smart Bulk Terminal can handle 180 mineral hopper barges/day and can load ships at a rate of 15,000 mt/day.
"Developing our own port terminal capacities enables us to decrease transportation costs and further strengthens PhosAgro's position as the leader on the global cost curve," PhosAgro Chief Executive Andrey Guryev said in a company statement.
Total investments in the project amounted to RUB 650 million ($12 million), with funds coming from PhosAgro and Ultramar, Russia's largest provider of container transportation services for fertilizers, in accordance with their 70/30 ownership of Smart Bulk Terminal.

Using FW prices in contracts: Many subscribers to Fertilizer Week use Fertilizer Week benchmark prices in their contracts. When both sides in a business arrangement agree in advance to use a set of prices it creates more certainty and saves everyone time – as long as the prices can be relied upon. Fertilizer Week publishes a regularly updated methodology document with detailed definitions of every price we publish. By understanding how we calculate our prices, you will be able to build your own scenarios based on these prices
