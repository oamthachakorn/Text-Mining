ANALYSIS
Brazilian price plans develop and BPC agrees Indian potash volumes
At the IFA Istanbul conference this week, potash suppliers developed their price targets for Brazil in the hopes of recovering weak prices so far in 2015 and BPC signed an increase in volumes to India, likely confirming an increase in Indian demand during the fertilizer year.
The Belarusian producer confirmed that it agreed Indian volumes for the current fertilizer year ended March 2016 with both regular BPC buyer IPL and three others. Although exact quantities have not been released, the deal is believed to be for more than 700,000 mt at the new contract price of $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit.
The agreement brings total contracted Indian potash volumes so far to 3.5-3.7 million mt, including some optional tonnage, compared to a total of 3.9 million mt last year. ICL and K+S is still to agree volumes (roughly 700,000 mt and 200,000 mt last year respectively), but ICL is unlikely to sign a deal to India unless ongoing strikes at its Dead Sea Works operations can be brought to an end.
PhosAgro also signed a three-year NPK supply deal to IPL during IFA for 1.35 million mt after a nearly two-year absence. The deal may lead to a slowdown in the domestic NPK production increases which have recently helped boost Indian demand for potash but with most potash contracts already signed to India, overall Indian potash imports are expected to increase to 4.4-4.8 million mt in the current fertilizer year from 4.2 million mt last year.
The increase in Indian demand runs parallel to a recent volume increase in Chinese contracts (6.1 million mt) and Chinese imports data, which shows an 18% increase in potash deliveries between January and April to 2.4 million mt. While demand is expected to fall in some global markets like Brazil during 2015, it is unlikely that deliveries will fall as far as some are expecting, still total demand should be in the range of 58-60.4 million mt in 2015.
Prices in the global spot markets have been significantly weaker than suppliers had targeted so far in 2015. This week, US prices have continued their downward trend with key planting largely completed in the Midwest and demand dropping across the buying regions. Prices in the US south have fallen to as low as $380/st FOB while NOLA barge prices cannot be seen higher than $325/st FOB.
In Southeast Asia, prices are largely the same but Malaysian sMOP quotes have lowered to $310-315/mt CFR with current larger tenders unlikely to push up prices in the near term. The price range across the region is seen at $310- 350/mt CFR with the upper end of deals only seen in the smaller markets like The Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.
In Europe prices are also flat with potash buying out of season. Granular potash is quoted at €305-315/mt CIF with most quotes at €310/mt CIF, while standard quotes are seen at the very weak level of €270-280/mt CIF.
Most suppliers at IFA were highlighting the Brazilian market as their opportunity to boost spot prices in 2015 after the lacklustre start to 2015. The major suppliers have set their June and July delivery prices at $340-345/mt CFR and hope that they can further increase prices through until October. If some of these gains can be achieved in Brazil over the coming months it will likely have a knock on effect in the other spot markets by the end of the year but spot prices are unlikely to reach the levels they ended 2014.

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.
MARKETS
MOP
NORTH AMERICA
US S Plains: Truck values flat despite resupply problem
Granular potash truck values have not gained, despite the lack of resupply available from the barge market due to regional flooding. Quotes for potash from terminals along the Arkansas River remain around $380/st FOB, but distributors report retailers already have sufficient tons in hand to meet their remaining seasonal commitments.
US NOLA: Little demand remains for potash
Modest demand remains for granular potash, and it appears further price cuts from the current price tag of $325/st FOB New Orleans will do little if anything to boost demand at this stage of the season.
US buyers expect BPC will participate in the import market over the summer, perhaps shipping as much as 200,000 mt to the US. However, no deals are believed settled with potential importers at press time.
US Midwest: Potash needs met for season
Granular potash demand from retailers is down substantially, as corn and soybean planting is largely completed across the region.
Farmers generally are concerned with secondary nitrogen applications at this stage, and there is little enthusiasm for potential fill offers from Canadian producers in coming weeks.
Distributors suggest a discount of $20/st from recent retail values in the $380s/st FOB Midwest would might be needed to drive summer fill sales. However, with only moderate amounts of offshore potash likely to arrive over the summer, domestic producers may not have to give that much ground.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Suppliers target $340-345/mt CFR in Brazil
Brazil is now seen as the key region for increasing potash spot prices after a weak H1, with US and European markets largely out of season and the Southeast Asian market likely to see little change from their current weak levels until autumn.
Prices are currently seen at $330-340/mt CFR with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. BPC and SQM are currently looking for $340/mt CFR for June/July deliveries and Uralkali have priced July deliveries at $345/mt CFR. Canpotex is believed to also be pricing in the $340-345/mt CFR range for June/July deliveries.
With Q1 Brazilian potash imports very low, buyers are expected to pick up high levels of volumes in the next few months in order to limit delays at port during September and October.
Suppliers plan to take a staged approach to price increases and if $340-345/mt levels can be maintained for July deliveries then suppliers will likely try to push for $350-370/mt levels before the end of the Brazilian season. However, the $380/mt CFR price achieved by October 2014 is unlikely to be reached before the end of 2015.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Belarus: Belaruskali postpones maintenance plans
Belaruskali postponed planned maintenance at RU-2 at the end of May and at RU-3 at the start of June.
The company made the decision to continue its current high rate of shipments to China and the forthcoming deliveries to India under the new contract.
It is unclear when the sites will go down for maintenance, if at all in 2015.
EUROPE
Europe: Action slows and prices unchanged
The European potash market has entered its end of season lull with gMOP prices stable at €305-315/mt CIF ($332-344).
Most suppliers quote prices around €310/mt CIF after K+S increased its prices to €315/mt CIF earlier in May but note that deals are currently limited.
Standard potash prices in Europe are seen at the exceptionally weak level of around €270-280/mt CIF ($294-305) pushing suppliers to focus standard deliveries on other markets. However, some sources indicate possible tightness in standard supply during 2015 with large supplies going to India and China while BPC is said to be producing at as high as 70-80% granular product.
Tight supply may help the standard European market see some recovery in the coming months.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: BPC agrees Indian potash volumes
Belarusian potash exporter BPC has signed its Indian quantity agreements for the current fertilizer year ending March 2016 with both regular BPC buyer IPL and three others but the exact quantity has yet to be announced.
It is believed that the company has agreed to an increase in volumes above the 700,000 mt sent by BPC to India in the previous fertilizer year.
The deal further backs up expectations of an increase in Indian demand during the current fertilizer year despite the $10/mt increase in the current contract price to $332/mt with 180 days credit.
The agreement brings total potash volumes, including some of the optional tonnage, to around 3.5-3.7 million mt. With further optional tonnage also likely to be sent to India, spot deals and tenders through the year, and both ICL and K+S still to sign volumes (700,000 mt and 200,000 mt last year respectively), Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014’s 4.2 million mt.
According to Indian vessel data, around 50,000 mt has been booked for arrival in the first two weeks of June and May deliveries totalled only around 200,000 mt as suppliers agreed contracts for the new fertilizer year.
Bangladesh: Canpotex agrees BADC deal
Canpotex is to supply as much as $60 million of potash to Bangladesh in the current fertilizer year.
The deal was signed between the Canadian Commercial Corp on behalf of Canpotex and the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) and includes $40 million worth of potash and an additional $20 million in optional volumes.
The exact volumes have not been announced but are likely to be similar to the 120,000 mt signed during 2014 for $40 million between Canpotex and BADC, which also included an option worth $20 million for an additional 60,000 mt.
India: BPC awarded RCF MOP tender
BPC has been awarded RCF's tender for 145,000 mt firm and 120,000 mt optional MOP, closed on May 7.
The Belarusian producer was awarded the tender at the new Indian contract price of $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit.
MMTC, IPL and Transmart DMCC also made offers at $332/mt CFR with 180 days.
Delivery is split into three shipments to India in June for the firm volumes and two shipments in August for the optional tonnes.
The MMTC tender for 145,000 mt, which was expected as cover to offer in the RCF tender, is believed likely to be scrapped.
Price offers on the NFL tender for 50,000 mt which closed on May 10 have yet to be announced but should be released in the next few days.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Vietnam: MOP imports at high level in 2015
Vietnam imported 106,505 mt of potash in April, a 24% increase year on year, according to port data, with high levels of imports believed to be continuing through May.
NPK production was seen at over 560,000 mt in Q1 2015 and the January-April MOP imports total 365,000, up 23% on 2014. Currently Vietnamese potash prices are quoted at $330-340/mt CFR.
China: Domestic prices flat amid high imports
With the end of spring application season, domestic potash purchasing activity in China has become slow and thin. Most distributors and downstream users adopt hand-to-mouth buying strategies.
Prices on the whole remain stable. Despite wholesale prices still ranging from RMB 2,000- 2,130/mt FCA ($323-344/mt) at port, the mainstream prices of 62% K2O white MOP slid again and dealt at RMB 2,100/mt FCA ($339/mt) this week, while the high end still stands at RMB 2,130/mt with small quantities.
As Fertilizer Week estimated, the April imports reached 822,612 tonnes, up by 9.1% on the 747,774 tonnes imported in April 2014. The January-April imports totalled 2.81 million tonnes, up by 18.1% on the 2.38 million tonnes imported during the same period in 2014.
BPC is currently the biggest supplier to China, accounting for nearly 30% of total January-April imports. In addition, shipments from Laos seem more consistent since Oct 2014. China imported
65,827 tonnes of MOP from Laos in January-April 2015, making the country the 7th largest exporter to China, exceeding Chile and Uzbekistan.
Southeast Asia: Suppliers struggling to push up prices
Malaysian potash prices have slipped to as low as $310-315/mt CFR with the current larger tenders unlikely to achieve higher prices in the near term and significant price increases later in the year largely reliant on a price push in Brazil.
Currency depreciation, weak agricultural commodity prices and high competition in the country have forced the Malaysian price below even the new Chinese contract level but suppliers hope they can achieve at least $330/mt CFR levels between September and December when the market builds again.
Indonesia is also priced below the $330/mt CFR level with some suppliers quoting deals as low as $315/mt CFR.
Vietnam and Thailand prices are seen at $330-345/mt CFR. High levels of imports are being seen into both countries including recent shipments from Uralkali and BPC.
Small deals to the Philippines continue to be quoted as high as $350/mt CFR for Canpotex volumes. The total range in Southeast Asia is now seen at $310-350/mt CFR.
SOP
EUROPE
Europe: SOP prices increase further in tight market
The European SOP market remains tight and prices have increased to the high level of €460-500/mt FCA from €450-470/mt FCA with contract deals at the low end and limited spot business by K+S and Chinese suppliers made at the top end. There are some unconfirmed deals as high as €520/mt FCA.
After a bumper year in 2014 regarding SOP production in China, some Chinese volumes are managing to make it into the European market for spot deals but not enough has arrived to have any effect on the under supply situation.
Between January and April, China exported 43,275 mt SOP, around 70% of its entire 2015 exports and more than five times than the same period in 2014. Just under half of the exports went straight to the European market.
Tessenderlo is still on track to increase production at the end of 2015 once it has converted its plant at Ham, Belgium, to a stand-alone SOP unit while other suppliers are likely to bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year.
K+S may also choose to increase SOP production in Europe towards the end of 2016, replacing some European MOP production with SOP when its major Legacy potash mine in Saskatchewan begins production.

MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP announces Toros deal, African deliveries
OCP has also announced an agreement to supply 50-100,000 mt DAP and some NPKs to Toros/Turkey for June-September shipment. Price details have not yet been disclosed.
OCP is planning to send 60,000 mt NPKs to Africa in June, mostly 15-15-15 for Nigeria but some 12-24-12 for Benin.
The Moroccan producer is indicating $330/mt FOB for 15-15-15 sales into African markets and $350/mt FOB for sales into Europe. Other NPK suppliers to Europe say that deals are very hard to come by with the market now out of season and prices continue to be quoted at $325-335/mt FOB Baltic.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: PhosAgro agrees three-year Indian NPK deal
PhosAgro agreed a three-year deal to sell 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs to India during the IFA conference this week.
The deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26 but is believed to also include DAP.
This deal follows the flurry of shipments (mainly DAP cargoes) sold for March/April shipment by PhosAgro to IPL and IFFCO earlier this year.
PhosAgro has not shipped any NPKs to India in such sizeable volumes since 2012 when it exported an estimated 250,000 mt through Ameropa against its contract with IFFCO.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: NPK imports increase with jump in Russian deliveries
China imported 413,428 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 64% increase on the previous year but lower than the same period in 2013, according to GTIS data.
During the period, China imported 140,000 mt from Russian producers, more than a three-fold increase year on year, after low levels of NPK deliveries during 2014, while Yara also delivered 140,000 mt NPKs.
It was expected that higher domestic NPK production in China would continue to push down imports in 2015 after an 18% fall in imports during 2014 but with some small Chinese NPK plants down in H1 due to environmental concerns and demand remaining strong, international suppliers have increased deliveries.
April saw an increase in NPK volumes to China with140,000 mt imported; the highest April levels since 2007, with Russian producers providing 40% of the April deliveries.
Southeast Asia: NPK prices increase on solid demand
Vietnam imported 57,188 mt NPKs in April bringing its January-April NPK imports to more than 100,000 mt with Q1 NPK production exceeding 560,000 mt.
May has continued to see shipments into Vietnam and current prices are around $405-410/mt CFR.
The Thailand and Myanmar markets are achieving even higher prices, putting the range at $410-420/mt CFR. As a result Southeast Asian NPK prices have increased by $5-10/mt and are seen in the $405-420/mt CFR range.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
Uralkali investors tender 11.89% of shares
Uralkali said investors tendered for 11.89% of shares in its recently-announced share buyback, less than it had looked for when the plan was announced.
The deal sees Uralkali buy $1.12 billion in stock rather than the $1.5 billion it had planned.
Uralkali may now have enough offers to buy shares in order to delist from the London Stock Exchange. With some shareholders believed to see the company as undervalued, Uralkali may now look to take the company private.
Uralkali offered $3.20/share and $16/GDR for as much as a 15.97% stake in the company.
The company said the plan, which will be funded by its existing cash-flow, was intended to help distribute cash to security-holders at a time when giving out dividends would not comply with company policy. It recommended waiving a dividend based on its full-year 2014 numbers. Major owners in Uralkali, Mikhail Prokhorov's Onexim Group and Uralchem, both voted against the payment of an interim dividend in December 2014.
Uralkali, which had a cash balance of $2.5 billion at the end of 2014, eventually plans to cancel the acquired shares.
In March, Uralkali announced a new strategy for 2015-2020 in the wake of flooding at its 2.3 million mt/year Solikamsk-2 mine. The $4.5 billion investment plan to raise capacity by 30% over the next five years includes construction of a new mine at SK-2.
Uralkali also recently agreed on a $530 million loan deal with a range of international lenders, Russian business' first international loan of 2015.
Earlier in May, major shareholder UralChem announced that it would not take part in the share buyback, considering the investment as 'strategic', leaving more opportunity for minority shareholders, including Acron, to get a better return.
