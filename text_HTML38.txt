Highlights this week
Urea markets still depressed
Ammonium sulfate markets steady
MAP markets still stable
Sulfur prices still high
MOP markets not improved
Exchange Rate: USD 1 = RMB 6.2
Urea
Production
China’s prill urea output was 757.9kt during the first week of July, down 2.45% from the week before. Granular output was down slightly by 1.29%, reaching 163.1kt. According to statistics of 8 July, daily urea output was 179.6kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 69.92%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 77.19%, while gas-based producers’ average is 52.6%.
Domestic market
Domestic urea markets remain depressed; prices dropped further by $3-8/t. New domestic orders are too few to support business as usual; market demand has decreased to some extent. The downward trend has made producers very anxious about sales, and some have started to consider shifting their efforts toward the export market.
In North China, Shanxi Province’s urea market prices followed the downward trend; the local urea makers mainly sent product to fulfill export orders, as domestic demand was limited. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $261-263/t. Overall, East China’s urea markets were stable; the seasonal agricultural demand in Shandong Province has started slowly, while the industrial demand remained sluggish. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $268-270/t. In Central China’s Henan Province, urea markets stayed stable; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $282-287/t.
Urea inventories in the main seaports amount to 614,000 tons, up 19,000 tons from last week; of that, 300,000 tons is in Yantai Port, 150,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 60,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port, 35,000 tons in Rizhao Port, 34,000 tons in Laizhou Port and 20,000 tons in Lianyungang Port.
Raw materials
Domestic anthracite markets were stable on the whole; the main coal companies kept their coal prices unchanged.
Page 3
Despite slack sales, price adjustments were discouraged by three factors – high coal inventories, weak demand and depressed coal markets. North China coal markets were normal, with prices unchanged. The main local coal producers will not adjust prices in the short term. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $123-127/t in Yangquan and Jincheng, the same as last week. In Central China, Henan Province anthracite markets kept steady; market demand was still weak. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices stayed stable: $151/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $152/t in Yongcheng. Southwest China’s anthracite market prices remained unchanged; local coal inventories were high. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $123/t.
Ammonium Sulfate
Domestic ammonium sulfate markets kept steady overall; prices rose a bit in some regions. Given the usual seasonal variations, the current level of market demand in East China is sufficient to support the market to keep developing steadily. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 68.5% average operating rate, down 0.2% from last week; caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers are operating at about 78% on average, up significantly 10% from last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $94-102/t in Shanxi Province, $103-113/t in Hebei Province, $113-119/t in East China, $97-105/t in Northeast China, and $90-100/t in Southwest China.
On 3 July, Hebei Qianan Jiujiang held a 600-ton ammonium sulfate tender; the selling price was $121/t, up $5/t from last week. Three days later, Hebei Handan Steel auctioned 1,100 tons of ammonium sulfate on the internet; the closing price was $109/t. On 9 July, Hebei Huafeng tendered ammonium sulfate, selling at $113/t, the same as last week.
The main seaports’ combined ammonium sulfate inventory is 70,000 tons, down 40,000 tons from last week, with 20,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 10,000 tons in Qingdao Port and 40,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port.
Phosphate & NPK
Production
Typical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 70% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province, and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm maintained its recent low operating rate. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and still maintains an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.
Domestic phosphate
DAP – Domestic DAP markets remained steady trend. Some DAP distributors in China began to enquire about prices; however, high DAP prices dampened purchase enthusiasm. The main DAP makers kept working on their export orders; some even have enough orders to last till the middle of August. Mainstream FOB prices are $465-473/t.
Central China DAP markets kept steady, with producers operating at around 70% and keeping comfortable inventory levels. Export orders were adequate; most producers have orders in hand that can last to the end of this month, or even to the middle of August. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Hubei Province stayed at $435/t for DAP with 64% content, and delivered prices for North and East China destinations are $460-468/t for DAP with 64% content, the same as last week. Southwest China’s DAP makers also focus on export markets. Mainstream FOB prices for DAP with 64% content are $465-473/t, and $475-483/t for Indian destinations.
DAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 546,000 tons, up 191,000 tons from last week; of that, 150,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 200,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 16,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 70,000 tons in Beihai Port, 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 50,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 10,000 tons in Nantong Port.
MAP – Domestic MAP markets remained stable, like last week; the main MAP makers processed existing orders; some have orders that could last to the beginning of next month.
In Central China, Hubei Province’s MAP spot markets remained tight, and prices stayed high. Some MAP makers declined new orders and waited to see the market develop. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $347/t for powder MAP
Page 4
with 55% content, and $371-379/t for powder MAP with 60% content, almost the same as last week.
Southwest China MAP makers continued to maintain low operating rates for powder MAP units, and some of them switched over to granular MAP products. Export markets turned flat; the existing orders can last 15-20 days. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan Province are $331-339/t for powder MAP with 55% content, $339-347/t for granular MAP with 55% content and $355/t for powder MAP with 60% content.
The main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 115,000 tons, down 30,000 tons from last week, including 40,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 10,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port, 15,000 tons Laizhou Port and 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port.

Domestic FMP markets were still quiet. Some producers in the main regions overhauled; they plan to resume production at the end of this month. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $71-77/t for FMP (12%) and $87-94/t for FMP (15%).
International phosphates
The global phosphates market trade is again moving on the slow rate. For now in Asia, the main markets are Pakistan for the spot DAP, Bangladesh for the contract DAP, and for India DAP under the China MoU business. Compared to June, the India price is a bit lower in mid/high low $470s/t cfr. For Saudi Arabia DAP, there is no deal said for July shipment under the Saudi Arabia contracts. The China exports to Vietnam and Southeast Asia are heard in $480s/t cfr. For the Western markets, the trend follows different directions. For Europe, the price of DAP is flat in $520s/t fot ex store at the main ports. For USA domestic, the price of DAP and MAP are firming, now to low $430s/short ton fob barge. In South America, the MAP 11-52 price ideas of importers starts in $480s/t cfr Brazil, but the supplier offers are still holding up in $490s/t cfr. For Brazil TSP, price offers stay close to $390/t cfr.
Raw materials
Sulfur: Domestic sulfur market prices stayed high. Due to strong international sulfur prices, domestic traders showed optimism, declining to lower prices to increase sales volume. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $174-189/t in Northeast China, $198-210/t in North China, $194-205/t in East China, $182-194/t in South China and $195-206/t in Southwest China.
Imported sulfur prices continued the upswing on the whole. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 936,000 tons of sulfur on hand, down 4,000 tons from last week, with 330,000 tons in Nantong Port, 60,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 110,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 100,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 34,000 tons in Beihai Port and 260,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.
Sulfur Price and Inventory
Note: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.
Phosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets were stable; the rock producers who had previously stopped mining began to resume production gradually. Recently, sales were disappointing. In the international market, phosphate rock prices also stayed unchanged. Guizhou Province phosphate rock markets fluctuated little. Some rock mines remained idle due to previous rainfall. Producers generally are selling down inventory because of operational difficulties that come with the rainy season. Resuming production depends on the weather. FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock market prices kept constant; mainstream rock prices are $42-45/t for 28% content at Mabian, $35/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock markets remained stable; rock prices there are $42/t for 28% content.
NPK
Domestic NPK – Domestic NPK markets looked quiet this week. The market's reaction to autumn fertilizer policies and prices announced by some of the main NPK makers was not obvious. Mainstream prices stayed at $323-339/t for
Page 5
MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as last week. In East China’s Shandong Province, the main NPK makers began to announce their autumn fertilizer pricing policies. The new mainstream ex-factory prices there are $306-323/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $355-371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In North China, Shanxi Province’s NPK markets remained weak overall. The local producers lowered their operating rates slightly. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $290/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $347/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In Central China, Hubei Province NPK markets were still steady; new autumn NPK prices were higher than at the same time of last year. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $290/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $355-368/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).
Potash
Domestic potash
Domestic demand for MOP did not improve overall. The wait-and-see atmosphere was still predominant. As MOP sales are off season, inventories are sufficient and sales have become a concern. Having received plenty of orders recently, Qinghai Yanhu raised its prices by $11/t at the beginning of this month. Other small factories in Qinghai Province maintained stable prices. Yanhu Group keeps its MOP units running at full load; its MOP capacity is 5.5 million tons. Yanhu produces 15,000 tons per day. Its prices are $323/t for white MOP with 60% content, up $11/t from last week. Golmud Zangge produces 7,000 tons per day; its price for white MOP with 60% content is stable at $323/t.
with 50% content, and $500-516/t for granular SOP with 50% content. Xinjiang Luobupo Company’s units have remained idle since June 27 for a two-month overhaul. Its annual SOP capacity is 1.7 million tons. The firm’s SOP prices remained stable: powder SOP with 51% content is $452/t and granular SOP with 51% content is $484/t.
In the seaport markets for imported MOP, the supply was adequate overall. Prices were unchanged: Russian red MOP with 60% content sells for $323-339/t in most seaports; Russian white MOP with 62% content is $339-342/t. In the border trade market, Russia sent almost no new MOP products to Northeast China by railway this month. The local prices stayed at $311/t for Russian white MOP with 62% content.
Domestic SOP markets were steady on the whole. The main SOP makers maintained stable operating rates, and their mainstream prices stayed at $452-484/t for powder SOP
International potash
In Asia, the main focus of the spot market gets back on standard MOP. Canpotex is presenting a new target for sMOP at $335pt cfr to all SE Asia import markets. This is up about $15-18 from last business of bulk cargoes to the large markets of Indonesia and Malaysia. The market activity is slow for the granular grade in the Western markets. Brazil, the price of imported granular MOP continues flat in range mid $320s-mid 330/t cfr. This is in the line of June export prices. In the USA, the domestic fill prices announcements at $355pst fob means inland market is now lined with the

Story & Analysis
Quick Glance at China’s Ammonium Chloride Market
Capacity and production
China’s ammonium chloride capacity reached about 15.89 million tpy at the end of 2014, according to China Soda Industry Association.
Roughly, the geographical distribution of China’s ammonium chloride capacity is: 1) Jiangsu, 25.7%; 2) Sichuan, 15.9%; 3) Hubei, 12.6%; 4) Henan, 10.1%; 5) Hebei, 5.0%; 6) Shanxi, 4.6%; 7) Tianjin, 4.3%; 8) Hunan, 3.7%; 9) Gansu, 3.4%; 10) Fujian, 3.1%; 11) Shaanxi, 2.9%; 12), Yunnan, 2.9%; and 13) Others, 5.9%.
China’s ammonium chloride output increased from 5.1 million tons in 2004 to 6.24 million tons in 2006, 8.6 million tons in 2008, 9.15 million tons in 2010 and 12.5 million tons in 2013.
According to the CSIA, last year a few domestic producers shut down ammonium chloride plants, including Sichuan Zigong Honghua, 0.5 million tpy; Hebei Shuanglian, 0.5 million tpy; Henan Pingdingshan, 0.3 million tpy; Shanxi Fengxi, 0.3 million tpy; Sichuan Zigong Fuyuan, 0.1 million tpy; and Jiangsu Kunshan Jingang, 0.6 million tpy. In addition, Sichuan Hebang will shut down a 0.3 million tpy ammonium chloride plant.
Five factors impacting the ammonium chloride market
China’s ammonium chloride enterprises have been coping
with low prices for their product for years now. In the second half of 2013, the prices of ammonium chloride averaged RMB 640/t, more than RMB 200/t lower than in the first half of that year. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014, the average price kept declining, dropping from RMB 640/t to RMB 350/t. Then the price trend flattened until April 2015, when prices started to rebound and climbed to RMB 550/t in mid-June.
Five factors are believed to have influenced the domestic ammonium chloride market.
First, China’s capacity for ammonium chloride is big.
Second, the prices of urea have been low, placing great pressure on the ammonium chloride market.
Third, China’s output of both ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate has increased significantly in recent years, and these products have in part replaced the use of ammonium chloride in NPK production.
Fourth, the shift toward tower granulation NPK and high concentration NPK has reduced the use of ammonium chloride. Urea and liquid ammonia are used as raw materials for making high concentration NPK. Ammonium chloride is mainly used as raw material for making low- and medium-concentration NPK products.
Finally, China’s export of ammonium chloride has been
Page 7
small.
Proposals for a better supply/demand balance
1 Increase the export of ammonium chloride. China’s ammonium chloride exports have been low. The country’s annual export of ammonium chloride averages only about 3% of its annual ammonium chloride output.
2 Make granulated ammonium chloride that can be used
directly as a fertilizer in agricultural production. Currently, most domestic ammonium chloride products are used as raw materials in NPK production.
3 Some soda enterprises that employ Hou’s process can switch over to other technologies to produce soda, consequently reducing the country’s ammonium chloride output.

New Fertilizer Project in China
1) Urea Project (1000tpy, Product)
Note: some new projects have been completed in 2011, and were delayed to put into production to 2012, such as Guodian Chifeng, Guizhou Jinchi, Jinxin Chemical, Kuitun Jinjiang Chemical and Yangmei Heshun.
We revised the 2011’s table and put these projects into 2012’s table. In addition, 520k tons of urea capacity of Inner Mongolia Tianrun has been delayed to 2013 due to uncertain factors. So the actual new capacity of urea in 2011 putting into production was 3.14m tons.
