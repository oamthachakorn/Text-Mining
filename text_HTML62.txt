Fertilizer Shipping Market Report
15th June – 19th June 2015
Sentiment in the market is becoming slightly more bullish as rates have continued to climb across the board.
For the majority of commodities volumes exported has been increasing ever so slightly meaning that vessels now are more in demand and owners are taking advantage of this. Period rates for nice Supras and eco ultras has also been picking up, with noticeably more enquiries.
.
HANDYSIZE
Current trend: UP
We have seen more coal and bauxite stems in South East Asia this week which is assisting to reduce the tonnage count.
There has also been an increase in grain stems for the smaller sizes from Australia. In Far East, we have seen many steels and Fertz cargos with various directions, including backhaul. Several fixtures have been reported heading back into the Atlantic with healthier numbers also.
Both S Atlantic and USG is picking up – with USG leading. Baltic/Continent is flat, with little movement and supply/demand in balance.
Black Sea still soft whilst Middle East showing a firmer undertone.
Outlook: UP
We expect the firming trend will continue into next week
SUPRAMAX
Current trend: UP
Over the past two weeks the Pacific has showed noticeable improvements in time charter rates. Major cargoes including fertilizer/steels/coal /nickel ore have been active in Fareast and S.East Asia. Although there has not has been a huge surge in a particular commodity, it appears activity has picked up slightly all over, which is enough to take away a large number of vessels in both areas. Tonnage count remains high, but considerably less than that of 2 weeks ago. Period interests are also increasing.
Outlook: UP
A healthy flow of cargos is expected to come out between now and the end of July
PANAMAX
Current trend: UP
Coming from a positive previous week for owners, the market continued to pick up with time charters rates performing better across all routes. Again ECSA was the driving factor, which was helped by the increase in activity from the North Atlantic. In the east rates appeared to come up also as ships were absorbed by ECSA and thus creating a demand for the Indo and NOPAC rounds. More short and longer period deals were also concluded this week.
Outlook: UP
ECSA remains the center of attention and the reason for current changes on the Panamax size. We expect this to still be the case in the coming
