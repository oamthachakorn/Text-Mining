ANALYSIS
Suppliers pushed to concede discounts east of Suez
Further falls are noted east of Suez as buyers push for values closer to the equivalent of the Tampa February number at $310/mt CFR. Reports of ample supply in the region are helping their cause with suppliers seemingly left with little choice but to concede discounts to stimulate March sales.
Yara’s 15,000 mt sale to Namhae at $347/mt CFR surprised some regional traders who felt the drop in values too sharp. Others argued that it accurately represented a market awash with supply as Sabic and Petronas are still reported to have spot cargo available. It has also been suggested that Indonesia’s Pupuk Kaltim may switch from urea to greater ammonia output potentially compounding the ample supply situation, but this was not confirmed at the time of writing.
BASF China and FACT will certainly be hoping for lower offers in import tenders for 8,000 mt and 15,000 mt respectively which close February 5, after CJ Indonesia secured 6,000 mt spot cargo from Petrokimia Gresik at $368/mt CFR. A number of Indian buyers claim recent offers to FACT at $410/mt CFR under scrapped tenders have kept suppliers’ price ideas unrealistically high with no new offers below the $340-360/mt CFR range for spot enquiries. CIL said it will hold out for ammonia values around $320/mt CFR before securing a small spot parcel for March delivery.
Black Sea suppliers contend that although the market remains tough in February/March, prices are stable at $260-270/mt FOB with no urgency to sell product. OPZ remains shut on one ammonia line as Ameropa busies itself with contract commitments. Sorfert continues to run just one ammonia line while Fertial is also reported to be running just one ammonia line in Arzew due to export licence issues.
Despite this, buyers appear reluctant to conclude spot business west of Suez should prices fall further, citing limited demand and low prices for other fertilizers. The market will watch with interest at what price Turkey’s Gemlik must offer at to spur buying interest for possible exports after restarting ammonia production this week.
Mosaic's announcement this week of a Q1 production cut of up to 400,000 mt of finished phosphates in the US was expected, and it naturally means the phosphate giant will need less ammonia through March. The timing means it is unlikely that international suppliers will be in a position to extract a price increase at Tampa for March deliveries. Somewhat surprisingly, while speculation of a possible production cut by Mosaic was rumoured for months, similar rumours have not emerged with regard to ammonia output in Trinidad and Tobago, the main supplier of ammonia to the US Gulf.
Ammonia producers have cut prices by $10-22/st in all key US enduser markets, although new quotes from suppliers vary somewhat even within regions. The move is likely aimed at making up for some of the lost demand seen last fall, when wet weather substantially reduced the application window for ammonia, especially in the Midwest.
Highlights of the week:
∙CJ Indonesia tender awarded to Petrokimia Gresik at $368/mt CFR
∙BASF China closing 8,000 mt import tender February 5
∙Namhae buys 15,000 mt from Yara at $347/mt CFR
∙Pupuk Kaltim may reduce urea output in favour of ammonia
∙FACT issues 15,000mt retender closing February 5
∙Mitsui buys 3,000 mt KAFCO cargo under formula price
∙Sabic and Petronas may have spot cargo available
∙Turkey's Gemlik restarts ammonia output
∙Fertial running one ammonia line at Arzew due to export licence issues
∙Black Sea quiet; prices stable at $260-270/mt FOB
Short term outlook
Stability west of Suez although downwards price pressure remains. There is room for further falls east of Suez as buyers push for lower values on ample supply.
DAP versus ammonia
Mosaic announced long awaited DAP/MAP production cuts this week as market prices again tumbled on weak demand and high stocks. The company plans to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns, which could ease the demand for ammonia.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam values fell to $1,050-1,100/mt CFR China this week, the lowest the index has been according to CRU records dating back to July 2004.
MARKETS
AMMONIA
NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Mosaic cut hits demand
A rough estimate of lost US Gulf ammonia demand during Q1 is 73,000 mt, assuming Mosaic cuts finished phosphate production by the maximum indicated figure of 400,000 mt. However, the likely figure is more difficult to estimate compared to prior years as the company has not provided more details of the likely reduction betweek DAP, MAP and its MicroEssentials line. All tnese products consume various amounts of nitrogen and the company does not provide precise details on its MicroEssentials output.
US Northern Plains: Ammonia slightly lower
There no consistent reports out of the Dakotas regarding ammonia values, with some suppliers suggesting price cuts in the region are not as aggressive as seen in other regions. Sellers would only admit to about a $10/st decline from prior weeks to $490/st FOB. However, there remains time for buyers to push for cuts that more closely reflect ammonia costs seen in other US markets.
US S. Plains: More aggressive offers
Producers are backing lower prices for ammonia to ship on a prompt and forward basis in Oklahoma, Texas, southern Kansas and elsewhere. Prices have declined an average of $22/st from late January to $315-330/st FOB, according to distributors in the region.
Orders for ammonia are coming in based on these offers, with deliveries likely to be spread from coming weeks into March for use as pre-plant applications on corn acres.
US NOLA: Barge indications narrow
Inland ammonia resale values dropped this week, which cut into the potential return available for ammonia barges in the US Gulf and leaving the current week's range at $301-330/st FOB New Orleans.
The decline in the average price was only $10/st over the last week. However, that drop was the result of $20/st being subtracted entirely from the top end of last week's range of $301-350/st FOB.
US Midwest: Some suppliers offer cheaper ammonia
Not all suppliers are matching up, but prompt ammonia offers are more aggressive from some US producers and traders this week. Midwest retailers are finding offers from river and pipeline terminals at $430/st FOB this week, down $20/st from prior indications.
There are rumors of sales at even lower levels, based on trucked ammonia from plants farther afield, but there also are postings remaining at $450/st FOB from some sellers.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: November 2015 exports recover to 2013 levels
Russian ammonia exports for November 2015 were 300,009 mt, up on the 111,823 mt exported in the same period in 2014, and more or less in line with exports for 2013.
Total exports for the January-November 2015 period were
3.2million mt, up 3% year-on-year boosted by increased shipments to Belgium and Finland.
The largest recipient of Russian ammonia during the first 11 months of 2015 was Ukraine at 2.1 million mt, including product transported by pipeline to Odessa for export.
Another 540,694 mt was destined to Belgium during the period, up 104%.
Russia exported 215,392 to Finland, up 9% on the prior year.
Black Sea: No new trade; Ameropa charters Solaro
Another quiet week in the Black Sea with values assessed stable at $260-270/mt FOB.
Ameropa has chartered the Solaro for 2-3 months to cover freight requirements.
The vessel is slated to arrive in Yuzhnyy February 18 to load 25,000 mt, possibly for GCT Tunisia.
Koch’s Clipper Orion sailed February 3 with 30,000 mt OPZ product and 10,000 mt from Ameropa for SFC and Namhae in South Korea.
EUROPE
Turkey: Gemlik restarts output
Local reports suggest Gemlik restarted ammonia production this week after suspending output mid- December due to low AN values. It possible that Gemlik is now receiving cheaper gas compared with the end of 2015 due to gas contracts linked to lower oil values, making ammonia production more viable despite current prices pegged no higher than $300/mt CFR Turkey.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Algeria: Fertial runs just one ammonia line
Fertial is reported running just one ammonia line at Arzew following issues securing exports licences.
Sorfert still has one ammonia down at its Arzew plant.
Saudi Arabia: Sabic may have additional cargo
Reports suggesting Sabic has an additional cargo outside contract commitments for March lifting have not been confirmed by the producer.
Meanwhile, it is suggested that Qafco is experiencing technical issues at Qafco IV.
Middle East spot values have been assessed indicatively at $275-280/mt FOB on netbacks on Yara's 15,000 mt sale to Namhae at $347/mt CFR, taking into account freight costs of around $70/mt.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Bangladesh: Mitsui purchases 3,000 mt from KAFCO
Mitsui purchased 3,000 mt spot cargo from KAFCO under a formula pricing arrangement for lifting on the Gashcem Dollart February 5-6. The cargo will be taken to Singapore where Mitsui has a contract supply agreement.
India: Iran ammonia imports down, but Qatar up
Indian ammonia imports in November 2015 were registered by customs at 197,542 mt, a 13% increase on the same period in the prior year on greater volumes sourced from Qatar and Russia via Ukraine.
Total imports for the January-November 2015 period reached 1.9 million mt, an increase of 8% year-on year.
India sourced the majority of its ammonia during the first 11 months of this year from Iran at 575,334 mt, a 5% decrease on 2014.
Imports from Qatar were 411,929 mt, up 22%, while off- take from Russia shipped via Ukraine leapt 73% to 376,807 mt.
India: FACT retender closes February 5
Indian importer FACT retenders February 5 for 15,000 mt ammonia to be delivered to Cochin in two lots late February and first half March. This follows the scrapping of its February 1 session which attracted no offers.
Its January 21 tender for the same volume was also scrapped as offers for the two lots by Trammo and Muntajat at an identical $410/mt CFR basis sight payment were considered substantially in excess of actual spot values.
CIL said it will wait for ammonia values to fall to $320/mt CFR or below before securing a small spot parcel for March delivery.
Zuari said it shut down its ammonia and urea plants for maintenance from January 26, 2016. It is unclear how long the turnaround will last.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Taiwan: CPDC continues to rule out spot cargp
CPDC is focusing on contract ammonia deliveries for the next month.
Operation rates at its Toufen caprolactam plant are now at 80% following mechanical problems reported last week. Its acrylonitrile plant continues to run at 90% of rated capacity.
Ammonia countract prices in the country are pegged at $370-380/mt CFR.
China: BASF looking for ammonia spot cargo
Shanghai BASF Polyurethane Company issued an import tender for 8,000 mt ammonia closing February 5 at 16:00hrs Singapore time. Delivery is requested in March 1-10 dates.
South Korea: Namhae secures additional cargoes
Namhae has secured 15,000 mt ammonia from Yara outside contract commitments for March 1-5 delivery at $347/mt CFR, around $20/mt below regional values posted last week.
Another 13,000 mt additional cargo has been secured by Namhae from Koch for March 5-10 delivery likely off the Clipper Orion, with the parcel reported priced higher than the Yara deal.
SFC is not currently in the market for additional cargoes and will focus on contract commitments until early March at least.
Koch will discharge 27,000 mt off the Clipper Orion for SFC under an existing supply agreeement in March likely priced in the $360-370/mt CFR range.
Indonesia: Pupuk Kaltim may switch to more ammonia
There were suggestions at the time of writing that Pupuk Kaltim may be considering switching from urea to greater ammonia output.
Indonesia: CJ Indonesia awards tender at $368/mt CFR
CJ Indonesia is reported to have awarded its 6,000 mt ammonia import tender to Petrokimia Gresik at $368/mt CFR. Delivery of the cargo was requested in March 9-11 dates.
