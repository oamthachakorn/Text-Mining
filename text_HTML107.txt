ANALYSIS
Latin American nosedives could spread
The significant drop in granular urea values in Latin America this week was not a surprise, but was more severe than expected by many. The impact is likely to be felt by suppliers from most sources, but the main question faced by producers, endusers and traders is whether US prices will adjust down by a similar factor or if that market will provide a safe haven for cargoes seeking a home.
While nowhere near the $80/st collapse in US barge numbers last week, the $20-22/mt drop in Brazilian CFR numbers occured in a market that was already substantially below delivered prices into the US Gulf.
Freight to Brazil and the US Gulf from the Middle East do not differ substantially. The $290/mt CFR deal booked in Brazil this week would therefore reflect barge values in the US no higher than $270/st FOB. This is substantially below even the more pessimistic outlooks for July. Trades in August barge-tonnage and beyond in the US have however been concluded in the mid-$280s/st FOB, suggesting a distinct possibility of convergience for CFR values in Brazil and the US Gulf.
The aforementioned $290/mt CFR price for Brazil did grab the attention of US traders. Indications for August and September barges moved down from the high to low $280s/st FOB New Orleans late this week. However, the biggest difference in coming weeks for the US Gulf should be the elimination of the large price spread as cargos now are making up for the supply shortage seen during most of June.
It may of course be argued that this week's sales of Middle East granular urea in Latin America do not representy the actual market and that the disposal of length was out of desperation rather than rational business decisions. Importers' ability to hold off on additional purchases on the back of significant existing inventory do however suggest that this week's sales may be difficult if not impossible to repeat in the short term.
The impact on other sources of supply will be significant if Middle East values were to stabilize in the mid $270s/mt FOB or even in the mid-$280s/mt CFR. The latter would imply offers for key destinations such as India back into the low $290s/mt CFR from the most recent sales above $315/mt CFR. This would in turn reflect Chinese netbacks no higher than $280/mt FOB and FSU Black Sea returns some $10-15/mt lower, depending on cargo-size and discharge terms.
Chinese sellers are already fighting an uphill battle to sustain netbacks at or above $300/mt FOB, and traders appear happy to short forward positions some $15/mt lower, as was evidenced via low offers in the
June 29 MoA tender in Sri Lanka that permitted shipment into September. Small sales of Chinese prills and granular in regional markets for July loading reflected similar sentiment.
Urea application on corn in China is about to end, and domestic demand has already tapered off from recent peaks, resulting in lower quotes, also for export. This suggests a return to export potential in excess of 1 million mt/month, a volume that will fight for outlets with product from other sources that are due to ramp up exports in coming months.
Highlights of the week
∙Brazilian prices nosedive to an even $290/mt CFR
∙Argentine importers book granular at $300/mt CFR ahead of Brazil deal
∙US barge-values heading closer to $300/st as short positions covered
∙Chinese supply limited to 425,000 mt in the STC session in India
∙Chinese prills continue to trade at par with regular quality granular
∙Kaltim books 360,000 mt granular urea to load by December in formula-deals
∙Prompt FSU prills trade in Turkey at netbacks in low $280s/mt FOB
∙Ukraine rejects Gazprom offer for gas at $247.18/'000 cbm at border
∙Sri Lankan MoA tender June 29 oversubscribed at $10/mt discount on June 9 session
∙Pakistan Kharif availability finely balanced but TCP tenders yet to emerge
∙Sorfert in Algeria running well, but AOA output is awaiting restart
∙Egyptian output still erratic as government cuts gas further
Short term outlook
Softer still, and global values may still need to be corrected from some origins. Trader length rather than producer inventories triggered the most recent corrections, but continued oversupply though Q3 leaves little room for a rebound any time soon.
Ample pipeline stocks in most key markets outside the US imply that importers can continue to hold the upper hand in negotiations. Pockets of short positions could conceivably result in some upward voltaility, but the overall trend points south.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
Canada, US Atlantic: Algerian cargo headed for 2 ports
A 25-30,000 mt cargo of granular urea from Algeria will load this month for Trammo, with discharges at Fairless and Contrecoeur.
Market sources indicate about 10,000 mt of the urea will discharge for Yara at the Canadian port. Much of the Trammo volume could be destined for Canada also by rail from Fairless. The price tag for the imports was about $325/mt CFR.
US N Plains: Dakotas not reacting with other markets
Forward offers of granular urea are proving too much for distributors to fight when it comes to prompt pricing in the Dakotas. Postings do remain at $370/st DEL in places, but dry weather has hampered demand even before cheaper fill urea at around $345/st DEL was offered primarily from Canadian suppliers in prior weeks.
It is not possible to replace granular warehouse positions at values that reflect prices in the US Gulf, Midwest or Southern Plains markets on a prompt basis. But dry weather in the region has led to disappointing sales in recent weeks, likely leaving retailers in a position to get through remaining seasonal demand.
US NOLA: Broad range emerges as expected
By the end of the week confirmed business for granular urea available within a prompt window were spread out between $315-352/st FOB New Orleans, with the high end reflecting business conducted just after last week's close. Efforts to repeat business at the high end of the range did not succeed, but further business occured around $338/st FOB and multiple trades in the $320s/st FOB also were reported for 1H July.
At the end of the week some traders were bidding around $300/st FOB for prompt barges but transactions at this price tag could only be confirmed on forward business.
For months forward expectations of sharply lower prices have not come to fruition at New Orleans, as prompt demand has supported higher sales than indicated by prior forward business. Some sort of downward correction still seems very likely for 2H July-August, but August indications through FIS in the $280s/st FOB and confirmed physical trades in the $280s/st FOB for the same months would suggest that the bottom of the market is not substantially below recent market lows.
Market rumours regarding the start-up of CF's urea expansion at Donaldsonville, Louisiana are focused on late September or early October, at least for commercial rates. CF has not commented on this speculation.
US S Plains: Truck prices come off peaks
Even though granular urea remains in short supply in the Southern Plains region, seasonal slow downs in demand have eliminated the peak prices seen in last week's market. This week Arkansas River quotes are $390-395/st FOB.
Travel up the Arkansas River by barge is beginning again. Early this week travel was limited to daylight hours only and tows generally were just made up of six barges, roughly half the typical load for tugs.
US Midwest: Late demand holding prices up
Granular urea has sold as high as $420/st FOB this week in the Midwest. Wet weather continues to force growers to choose urea for top-dress applications on corn acres rather than ammonia or UAN in some areas.
Nevertheless, urea demand in the region likely has little time left. Corn is reported to be silking in many areas. This is not unusual for the time of year, but it means the benefits of further nitrogen applications are reduced for the current crop. Weather-related delays to top-dress applications now mean some corn acres have not received the volume of nitrogen farmers might have preferred.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Colombia: Imports down
January-April imports by Colombia as ascertained by customs via GTIS of 109,000 mt were down by a full 35.6% on the same period in 2014. Imports from China were nevertheless up by 50% to 55,500mt.
Deliveries from Venezuela were off by 47% to 41,000 mt and arrivals from Russia were down by 70% to a mere 11,000 mt. There were no shipments from Trinidad and Tobago, down from 9,400 mt in the same period in 2014.
April arrivals of 38,000 mt were off by 35.8%, including 20,400 mt from China, down by by 44.6% and deliveries from Venezuela were off by 70% to 6,600 mt. Russia accounted for 11,000 mt, up from zero in April 2014.
Argentina: Nitron widely associated with new sales
Nitron is widely suggested as the supplier of about 30,000 mt granular urea from Oman to two buyers in Argentina. The price secured was around an even $300/mt CFR, and the trader has fixed a vessel which is due to load from Sohar in July laydays.
Brazil: Seller concedes $290/mt CFR deal
The "wait and see" attitude adopted by Brazilian buyers of granular urea has paid off, yet again. Importers cited abundant availability of offers significantly below last week's quotes at $308-313/mt CFR early in the week, and a part cargo of 8,000 mt was booked July 2 by a major trader with Fertipar at an even $290/mt CFR.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Activity at low ebb, but netbacks suffer
A 10,000 mt cargo sold by a trader for southern Turkey around an even $295/mt CFR July 2 reflected netbacks to producers at an even $280/mt FOB from Yuzhnyy, but the trader may have been disposing of a prior position at a loss.
Offers from producers in the low $290s/mt FOB earlier in the week were not eliciting firm counters from traders that cited netbacks marginally above $280/mt FOB in support of calls for lower prices.
While the Ukraine goverment reportedly set natural gas prices for the chemical industry for July around a $313/'000 cbm CPT border equivalent, and claimed that imports of gas from Russia would be suspended, the government had an offer on the table for Q3 deliveries this week from Gazprom at $247.18/'000 cbm CPT. The Ukrainian government did however opt not to go for the Russian offer, citing ample opportunities to secure gas from other sources.
May shipments from Yuzhnyy panned out a shade short of 100,000 mt. July nominations are so far limited to the 8,000 mt currently loading from OPZ for Koch, originally destined to Italy, but the vessel may be diverted to Turkey:
EUROPE
UK: Offers claimed abundant at low numbers
UK importers claim that offers for granular urea for delivery in July and beyond are still abundant well below GBP 230/mt FCA in bags.
A second large cargo of Algerian urea is to arrive in July off the Lucky Trader for Koch from Sorfert. Koch is also loading the SDS Wind with 7,000 mt from Sorfert, but that vessel likely heads for France.
A GBP 230/mt FCA suggests a delivered value around $320/mt CIF while freight from Algeria is estimated in excess of $35/mt for a regular-size carrier.
Turkey: Buyers aim for lower numbers
Trade in prilled urea in Turkey is slow, and is mainly restricted to industrial buying, including some quantities required for NPK production.
Quotes to importers in southern Turkey were down by more than $10/mt from last week's $308/mt CFR with 180 days, duty unpaid.
Mainstream buyers were aiming for cover around $295/mt CFR, also with credit, for prompt positions, and are holding off on forward requirements. One cargo of 10,000 mt was suggested booked July 2 at the $295/mt CFR number including 180 days.
France: Trade slows further and prices inch lower
Repeat sales of July positions have been concluded at €295-298/mt FCA, but buyers are aiming for €285/mt FCA for August and beyond. The €295/mt FCA reflects about $315/mt CIF, duty paid, with no provisions for margins and financing.
Trade in Mediterranen ports is also seasonally slow, with offers from inventory around €290/mt FCA for a $310/mt CFR equivalent, duty paid.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Saudi Arabia: Safco V urea further delayed
As highlighted in the July 1 news update from Fertilizer Week, the start-up of Safco V’s 1.1 million mt/year granular urea plant in Jubail has been delayed further.
Following production trials through June, commercial output at the facility has been pushed back to some time in July, according to a press release issued by the producer.
Middle East: Producers face further price-deterioration
Netbacks to Middle East producers on cargoes priced via formula moved down further this week while spot purchasing remained subdued.
Firm offers and a subsequent sale in Brazil down to an even $290/mt CFR and two deals concluded in Argentina at $300/mt CFR are indicative of returns back down in the $270s/mt FOB versus the low end of last week estimated at $290/mt FOB.
Importers in Thailand also maintain a "wait and see" attitude and are in no hurry to secure additional parcels of granular urea, and cite ample quantity in warehouses in support of calls for lower quotes.
Producers are generally quite comfortable into July, but traders holding contract length that are struggling to place tonnage in Latin America had no choice but to accept the low bids in Brazil and Argentina.
While also heading further south, barge values for vessels discharging in the US in the second half of July are assessed no lower than $300/st FOB this week. This suggests a delivered value close to $325/mt CFR for producer-returns marginally below $300/mt FOB. Trades in barges concluded for August delivery at $285-288/st FOB New Orleans are indicative of netbacks no higher than $285/mt FOB Middle East.
One Contract of Affreightment (CoA) for four to five cargoes of 40-45,000 mt loading from Ruwais for the US has been fixed in the very low $20s/mt and a second CoA is likely to be finalised shortly at similar numbers, also from Ruwais.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Pakistan: Kharif availability finely tuned
Urea offtake in Pakistan was 422,000 mt in May 2015, up by 3.3% on deliveries in May 2014, according to latest statistics from the National Fertilizer Development Centre (NFDC). The April-May Kharif offtake of 788,000 mt was up by 18.4% on the 666,000 mt delivered in the same period in 2014.
NFDC estimated urea availability in May 2015 at 745,000 mt. This included an opening inventory of 356,000 mt and local production of 389,000 mt. No imports were recorded in May. The May 2015 closing balance was assessed at 323,000 mt.
Domestic production for the April-September 2015 Kharif season was assessed at 2.45 million mt for a total availability including carryover and imports marginally above 3 million mt. Full Kharif offtake is projected at 2.9 million mt, indicative of an opening inventory ahead of Rabi of a mere 102,000 mt.
Kharif imports are projected at 341,000 mt, inclusive of the 91,000 imported in April. Dreymoor and Samsung are each supplying 50,000 mt via awards in the May 29 and June 1 TCP tenders, and TCP is expected to tender shortly for the 150,000 mt cleared for import by the Economic Coordination Committee in June.
Sri Lanka: Transmart offers lowest in both MoA tenders
The June 29 MoA tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 12,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags for September distribution in Sri Lanka attracted offers from 13 traders. Offers for granular were submitted for 420,000 mt and offers for prilled or granular totaled 180,000 mt.
Transmart offered the lowest price in both sessions on both a 270 and 180 day credit basis.
Prices ranged from $336.29/mt CFR to $359.00/mt CFR for the granular and from $335.29/mt CFR to $364/mt CFR for the prills, all inclusive of 270 days credit.
Transmart's price for the 36,000 mt granular was $336.29/mt CFRFO with 270 days credit with Chinese product.
Trammo and Agri Commodities submitted the next two lowest offers at $336.75 and $337.00/mt CFRFO with 270 days respectively. Trammo offered Indonesian/Chinese product.
Transmart was also the lowest for the 12,000 mt prills/granular at $335.29/mt CFRFO with 270 days offering Uzbek product. The next lowest in this session was Dragon Fertilizers with Chinese at $338.13/mt CFRFO followed by AgriCommodities with Chinese at $340.50/mt CFRFO both with 270 days.
The total cost package for material originating from China is assessed around $52/mt for freight, bags, bagging, financing and reloading suggesting netbacks in the mid $280s/mt FOB, some $10/mt below the lowest offers in the June 9 tender.
Imports of urea into Sri Lanka in April identified by cutoms via GTIS in April of 61,000 mt were up by 58.6% on the prior year. Deliveries from the UAE accounted for 35,600 mt with the balance emanating from China.
January-April imports of 138,400 mt were nevertheless down by 8.6% on the prior year, but deliveries from China were up by 353% to 103,000 mt. UAE arrivals were off by 66% to the 35,600 mt imported in April.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
New Zealand: No new deals and May imports very low
There have been no new sales of urea reported since the Trammo sale to Ballance pursuant to the June 17 negotiations. May imports identified by customs via GTIS were meanwhile limited to a mere 1,500 mt, down from 51,000 mt in May 2014.
January-May imports of 183,000 mt were also lower, but only down by 8.6% on the prior year. Arrivals from Saudi Arabia of 123,000 mt were down by 48% while deliveries from China of 29,600 mt were up by 9%. Shipments originating in Malaysia of 26,600 mt were up by 61%.
Thailand: Urea buyers still appear in no hurry
Importers in Thailand concede that there is demand for additional tonnage, but buyers continue to decline offers into the low $310s/mt CFR. Indications of possible interest in spot positions are in line with Brazilian bids well below $300/mt CFR, but sellers are holding out for better returns.
Imports of urea in May meanwhile reached 310,000 mt, up by 25% on May 2014. Deliveries from Saudi Arabia accounted for 134,000 mt, up by 52%, and shipments from Kuwait of 61,500 mt were up from zero in May 2014. Indonesia suffered a major setback with deliveries dropping from 42,200 mt to a mere 3,600 mt.
The January-May volume of 861,000 mt was down by 3.6% on the prior year but delivereis from Saudi were up by close to 1% to 385,000 mt. Arrivals from Malaysia of 125,000 mt were off by 18% and Qatar lost about 9.3% with shipments of 124,000 mt.
Oman advanced from zero to 52,000 mt while China shipped 35,600 mt, a 38.5% drop. Indonesian arrivals of 33,300 mt were off by 50%.
Philippines: Demand expected to improve
Urea demand in the Philippines remains low, and trading is limited to small parcels of prills changing hand ahead of the rainy season. Replacement cargoes will need to be procured once movements to farms start in earnest, and volumes are expected to improve.
Sellers of inventory continue to hold out for prices in the $330s/mt CFR equivalent, but indications of interest from importers for forward positions are lower.
China: Domestic and export values slip further
Domestic and export values for prilled and granular urea tapered off further this week as the end of domestic corn application nears. Asking prices remained unchanged for prills around RMB 1,700/mt ($274/mt) EXW in northern provinces, but trades were confirmed down to RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) EXW and at RMB 1,570/mt ($253/mt) EXW in Henan.
Trades in prilled and granular urea in Shanxi were completed at par with last week at RMB 1,630-1,640/mt ($263-265/mt) FCA, mainly destined for delivery to ports for export.
Values for prills and granular delivered into ports were largely identical around RMB 1,700/mt CPT, indicative of an export price around an even $300/mt FOB for both grades, plus a margin for an exporter.
Repeat export-trades in prilled and granular urea are confirmed to traders short for prompt loading for India around $302/mt FOB, and in the high $290s/mt FOB for full July loading. Traders are however evidently convinced that forward coverage will be available at significantly lower numbers.
Sales in South Korea this week of 3,000 mt granular and 2,000 mt prills were indicative of netbacks in the low $290s/mt FOB, and the most competitive offers in the June 29 Sri Lankan tender reflected expectations of August and September availability at or below $285/mt FOB.
Indonesia: Kaltim books 360,000 mt granular urea
The Pupuk Kaltim tender for the sale of 360,000 mt granular urea for loading through mid-December to be priced via formula resulted in awards to four traders. The session called for bids for premiums to be paid on top of prices established via a formula.
The formula applies average published FOB values for granular urea in Southeast Asia and the Middle East for two weeks ahead of the date of presentation of Notice of Readiness by each carrier nominated.
∙Ameropa bid at a premium of $1.00/mt above the formula price and was awarded 150,000 mt
∙Koch bid at an initial premium of $0.80/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 90,000 mt
∙EuroChem bid at an initial premium of $0.40/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 60,000 mt
∙Dreymoor bid at an initial premium of $0.10/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 60,000 mt
Kaltim retains the right not to sell/deliver under formula allocations if the formula averages plus the premium agreed result in netbacks below the producer's minimum price. This will be calculated on the basis of returns achieved in the month prior to the actual month of nominations/planned shipments under the formula.
Swiss Singapore and CHS submitted bids in the initial round, but did not match the Ameropa proposal. The following declined:
∙Brio
∙Daewoo
∙Incitec Pivot
∙Indagro
∙Keytrade
∙Liven
∙Mitsui
∙Trammo

ANALYSIS
UAN prices weaken slightly on latest Abu Qir sale
UAN
UAN prices have showed some signs of weakening following the Abu Qir result. The producer managed to sell 8,000 mt to Ameropa at $192/mt FOB in its July 2 sales tender for 15,000t for early-July loading, representing a drop of $4/mt on the producer’s previous 10,000 mt sale to Unifert. The cargo is headed for Europe.
Abu Qir issued another UAN-32 sales tender for 20,000 mt closing July 8, calling for bids for the tonnage for shipment July 12-15.
Sales into France remain slow as farmers turn their attention to the impending harvest. Prices have reached €198/mt FCA in recent days.
GrodnoAzot sold 25,000 mt to Dreymoor, reportedly around €170/mt FOB following its June 26 tender. It is unclear where the cargo is headed.
Ammonium sulphate
Activity in the AS market has been scarce and consequently few price movements are noted. No new trade was reported fixed in China and caprolactam grade AS remain in the low $130s/mt FOB.
Petrokimia Gresik’s purchase of 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS last for first half August arrival to Makassar port from Fertzcomm was reportedly fixed around $148/mt CFR. This follows the buyer's June 22 import tender. This would provide Chinese netbacks at least $10/mt lower than current indications.
A number of small Black Sea steel grade sales were concluded by Evraz and NLMK in the high $120s/mt FOB. It is unclear where these cargoes will be headed.
Belarus’ GrodnoAzot will close a 25,000 mt AS tender July 6.
In the US the end of the spring season and subsequent fill offers from producers have resulted in much lower offers in the interior markets, albeit still above international indications. US shipments trailed demand for much of Q1 and Q2, which kept prices unusually high especially in the Midwest.
Ammonium nitrate/CAN
Summer doldrums prevail in Europe for ammonium nitrate and CAN and offshore importers of solid nitrates also hold off on purchasing. Further, but modest increases in prices for AN and CAN announced for France by Yara this week for August deliveries were in line with expectaions, but are yet to be tested in terms of quantities distributors are prepared to add.
Brazilian importers are declining offers for AN in the upper $220s/mt CFR, and will fight efforts by producers to maintain prices at such levels as urea prices continue to drop in the country. A sale this week of granular urea at $290/mt CFR was down by more than $17/mt on trades last week while offers for AN were unchanged or even higher than the prior week.
MARKETS

NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: CF Industries’ fill offers succeeded
CF Industries' fill offers for UAN brought buyers across the region to the table to commit material generally expected to ship mostly during Q3. Suppliers are expected to seek higher prices in Q4, but for now indications across the region likely will hold at $7.56-7.81/unit FOB.
Overall, CF's price list was more aggressive than many expected. However, it was roughly in line with indications released by small suppliers earlier in June. Aggressive pricing from all suppliers likely was needed for this year's fill as anecdotal reports suggest carryover UAN is greater than nomal, especially west of the Mississippi River.

Belarus: Dreymoor buys 25,000 mt GrodnoAzot material
GrodnoAzot sold 25,000 mt UAN-32 to Dreymoor, reportedly around €170/mt FOB following its June 26 tender. It is unclear where the cargo is headed.
The producer indicated that it will issue its next tender at the end of this month.

France: UAN market remains extremely slow
UAN sales into France have been slow as farmers turn their attention to the impending harvest. Prices have reached €198/mt FCA in recent days.

Egypt: Abu Qir sells to Ameropa at $192/mt FOB
Abu Qir sold 8,000 mt UAN-32 to Ameropa at $192/mt FOB in its July 2 sales tender for 15,000t for early- July loading. This represents a drop of $4/mt on the producer’s previous 10,000 mt sale to Unifert. The cargo is headed for Europe.
Abu Qir also issued another UAN-32 sales tender for 20,000 mt closing July 8, calling for bids for the tonnage for shipment July 12-15.
AS
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Fill indications bring offers down
Fill offers from Honeywell and other US suppliers are reported at $270-280/st FOB across the region for granular product.
This is a huge drop from the sales values seen at the peak of spring demand, but the season was marked by spot outages and better than expected demand as some retailers and distributors moved away from ammonium nitrate.
US S Plains: AS holds value as seasonal demand ends
Despite the somewhat disappointing reports regarding demand from the rice market this year due to adverse weather, seasonal demand for ammonium sulphate was sufficient to enable distributors to end June with minimal carryover.
Quotes for truckloads along the Arkansas River are $290-295/st FOB. This is just $5/st off the seasonal peak, when first nitrogen applications were moving to rice acres. However, prices in Texas and in parts of Oklahoma are cited $20/st or more below river terminals based on recent fill offers from producers.

Belarus: GrodnoAzot to close another AS tender
GrodnoAzot will close a 25,000 mt AS tender July 6.
Black Sea: Steel grade sales in high $120s/mt FOB
A number of Black Sea steel grade sales of 1-4,000 mt each have been concluded by Evraz and NLMK in the high $120s/mt FOB. It is unclear where these cargoes will be headed, but Turkey is the most likely destination. Caprolactam grade business is non-existent.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Trade in the AS market dead slow
The Chinese AS market was extremely quiet this week and prices for caprolactam grade product remain in the low $130s/mt FOB.
China: Steady growth in AS exports continues
Chinese AS exports in May 2015 at 612,498 mt grew just under 50% year-on year reflecting a similar increase from 2013 to 2014.
This brings 2015 Chinese exports through May to
2.3million mt, up 41.8% on the same period in 2014.
Indonesia absorbed 462,376 mt of Chinese AS during the first five months of this year, up 76%, including both steel and caprolactam grades.
Turkey has also moved away from traditional Black Sea AS supply and is now importing more from China. Exports to Turkey grew 253% to 233,485 mt during January-May on greater supply options and competitive prices.
Chinese AS shipments to Brazil have also climbed considerably, increasing 170% to 185,483 mt for the same five month period.
Philippines: AS trade bogged down by import talks
Scarce AS activity is reported in the Philippines as some government agencies are looking into regulation and storage of the product due its potentially explosive nature when mixed with nitrates. This is in response to calls from other nitrates importers who face stricter regulations than AS is subjected to.
While AS importers can currently bring in product with no issues, they face the risk of being unable to clear their shipment for discharge without the proper permits should the legislation come into force ahead of arrival of a cargo. Application for permits in advance is difficult as there are no set guidelines for the procedures suggested.
Caprolactam grade AS prices in the country are pegged in the low to mid $160s/mt CFR ex-China.
Indonesia: Gresik buys AS from Fertzcomm
It has emerged that Petrokimia Gresik secured 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for first half August arrival to Makassar port from Fertzcomm, reportedly around $148/mt CFR. This follows the buyer's June 22 import tender.
South Korea: AS shipments continue to decrease
South Korean AS exports remain in decline and stood at 35,790 mt in May 2015, down 31% year-on-year due to increased competition from Chinese product.
Total South Korean shipments for January-May 2015 were 51,464 mt, less than the recorded export figure for just May in 2014.
Exports in April were particularly poor at just 186 mt.

France: Yara posts AN and CAN higher
Yara posted AN and CAN in France for August deliveries higher June 30. The producer lifted the quote for AN 33.5% N by €6/mt to €298/mt CPT from its June 10 quote at €292/mt CPT that was effective on posting. CAN 27% N was posted June 30 at €242/mt CPT, up from €237/mt CPT.

ANALYSIS
Quiet market ensues with scarce price movements
A combination of summer vacations, Ramadan observance and an ever shrinking supply of ammonia vessels served to create a calm if dull market. Prices are stable albeit with a firming trend and are expected to remain so over the coming month.
Spots of activity were noted west of Suez where Koch is tying up negotiations for a full 40,000 mt cargo from OPZ likely to be secured within a $385-390/mt FOB range. Trammo has almost concluded a 15,000 mt purchase from NF Trading at a similar price level if not marginally below for early July lifting for Turkish receivers.
Up to 16,000 mt is believed sold into Turkey by Ameropa and Trammo meeting Petkim and Bagfas enquiries. While prices were not disclosed, given little price movement of late, levels are believed unchanged in the low $400s/mt CFR.
Curiosity over the final destination of Koch’s Clipper Neptun which is expected to pass through Gibraltar July 10 is rife. Various traders have suggested that owing to Yara’s recent 20,000 mt purchase from the Baltic, a total of 40,000 mt for July lifting is simply not available in the region. That leaves Algeria or the Black Sea as possible supply sources.
The Middle East is not thought to have as much as 40,000 mt available although availability from Sabic is pegged at around 20,000 mt for August loading. A further small cargo for lifting within the next month is also not ruled out. This is linked to further delays in the commercial start-up of the Safco V granular urea plant, with the facility now expected to enter into full production late July.
Such delays have given Asian buyers hope of stemming further supplier attempts to push up ammonia pricing. India’s FACT has all but refused Trammo’s offer at $490/mt CFR under its June 30 tender for 7,500 mt, while Koch’s offer to sell spot cargo off the Clipper Orion to South Korea’s Namhae and Taiwan’s CPDC at $470/mt CFR have been rejected. Negotiations continue.
In the US, the $550-560/st FOB Midwest fill offers from CF Industries and similar indications from other suppliers were needed badly by retailers in the US. Many of those endusers still had ammonia purchased from January onwards at $590-620/st FOB, when the extent of the almost weekly downpours could not be predicted. The cheaper values will allow those players to substantially average their costs down going into next season, without taking away from producers' ability to raise price demands ahead of the fall.
Latest indications from Mosaic are that the company is carrying relatively little inventory of finsished phosphates, a situation that should not change in the coming months. Mosaic will ship DAP for its own system in India, and to its contract buyer in that country in the coming months. Further spot sales for India and Brazil are possible. Finally, North American producers will spend the next 60-90 days moving phosphates into position for domestic the fall season. There is little reason to expect any curtailment in ammonia demand during this period.
Highlights of the week:
∙NF close to securing sale to Trammo
∙Koch sourcing 40,000 mt from OPZ at $385-390/mt FOB
∙Petkim and Bagfas buy 16,000 mt total from Black Sea suppliers in low $400s/mt CFR
∙Ameropa sells spot cargo to Borealis off Gas Manta due to high BASF inventories
∙Clipper Neptun may head to Algeria or Black Sea, Baltic looking unlikely
∙FACT receives Trammo offer at $490/mt CFR following June 30 tender
∙Koch offering spot cargo to Namhae and CPDC
Short term outlook
Prices look set to remain stable at current levels with few new enquiries reported in the market.
Ammonia versus DAP
Curtailed production of DAP/MAP in Tunisia, South Africa and Jordan will continue to constrain ammonia demand in those markets. By contrast, and in no small part helped by such production issues, Moroccan granulation levels through July and into August are looking robust.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices slipped slightly to $1,730-1,750/mt CFR China this week.
In recent days caprolactam June 2015 contract prices have been fully settled at $1,770-1,810/mt CFR at sight in Taiwan and at $1,780-1,800/mt CFR basis 90 days in China. Sinopec concluded its June contract at RMB13,850/mt while DSM/Nanjing settled at RMB14,100/mt.

US Gulf: Demand may have downs and ups
It is possible US Gulf demand may see some shifts downward before rebounding in August-September, depending on events outside of the supply chain to US DAP/MAP producers.
In the near term, demand for spot ammonia cargos to help refill the US direct application supply chain could easily be delayed, if reports reguarding lost sales this summer prove correct. Supposedly much of the carryover ammonia remains in the hands of retailers and distributors, which helps explain the fairly aggressive fill and pre-pay prices offered for the summer.
Looking farther ahead, marketplace scuttlebutt indicates CF could begin commercial production from its new Donaldsonville, Louisiana urea plant in late September or early October. That plant will rely on imported ammonia through Yara until Q1 or Q2 of next year when a supporting ammonia train will be completed at the CF complex.
US Midwest: CF Industries fill prices rule market
Even though regional buyers did not express anywhere near as much enthusiasm for fill and pre-pay ammonia, consistent reports to Fertilizer Week this week are that endusers booked as much ammonia as CF and other suppliers were willing to sell. One result is that the prompt market has moved roughly in line with fill offers from CF Industries and others at $550-560/st FOB.
Carryover ammonia is reported across the Midwest, due mostly to the uncooperative weather conditions. Despite this retailers generally were eager to make sure they go into the fall season with as much ammonia as they would normally carry. The $50-60/st price cut for the fill sales was more aggressive than many expected, but indicated producers' recognized the difficult financial math corn growers faced in the fertilizer year that just ended June 30.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Koch's Clipper Orion arriving soon
Koch’s time-chartered carrier Clipper Orion is expected in Yuzhnny July 12 to load a 40,000 mt cargo. OPZ is reported close to concluding negotiations for the sale of the full volume to Koch with the price likely in the $385-390/mt FOB range.
It has emerged that Koch’s 40,000 mt time-chartered vessel Jenny N will move to the LPG market from August, despite the trader’s charter of the vessel not expiring until February 2016. Petredec will likely use the Jenny N for LPG shipments from the US for at least six months from August.
The Marycam Swan has been fixed to arrive back in Yuzhnny July 5-6 following discussions conducted between NF Trading and Trammo regarding a 15,000 mt parcel. Tthe sale is close to being confirmed with both parties pointing to Yuzhnny values in the $380-390/mt FOB range.
It remains unclear whether Group DF’s Ukrainian plants CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot will restart nitrates output early July. Given announced maintenance of ammonia lines early June, ammonia would have to be supplied from an external source to run nitrates production. Group DF’s Rossosh facility in Russia had initially been suggested as a likely candidate but is still considered unlikely to agree to such a supply deal.
Loading of 23,500 mt OPZ tonnage on the Gaschem Stade has now been pushed back to July 8 due to delays discharging the vessel’s previous cargo in Jorf Lasfar.
While the Ukraine goverment reportedly set natural gas prices for the chemical industry for July around a $313/'000 cbm CPT border equivalent, and claimed that imports of gas from Russia would be suspended, the government had an offer on the table for Q3 deliveries this week from Gazprom at $247.18/'000 cbm CPT.
EUROPE
France: Ameropa's Gas Manta diverted to Rouen
Ameropa reportedly sold a mid-size cargo to Borealis after the Gas Manta was diverted from Antwerp to Rouen as the vessel was unable to discharge her entire cargo due to high inventories. The vessel arrived in Rouen July 2.
Turkey: Petkim and Bagfas ammonia purchases
Petkim is linked to a 6,000 mt purchase from Trammo believed secured in the low $400s/mt CFR for first half July delivery.
Ameropa, meanwhile, reportedly sold just under 10,000 mt to Bagfas for mid-July arrival at a similar price level.
It has emerged that Yara will lift 15,000 mt recently purchased from Gemlik at a “market price” on the Navigator Gusto around July 12 and will take the tonnage to its German Rostock plant.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Saudi Arabia: Sabic August spot cargo may be available
Sabic is rumoured to have at least one cargo outside of contract commitments to load in August.
This follows news that Sabic's partly owned Safco V 1.1 million mt/year granular urea plant in Jubail has seen its commercial start-up delayed further. It is now reported that the $530 million facility will commence commercial ouptut in July.
Morocco: OCP ammonia requirements low in July
OCP has reiterated that its ammonia requirements remain stable at a low level through July.
Granulation rates have been pegged at a steady 350,000 mt/month DAP/MAP with some potential to increase in July, but this necessitates additional phosphoric acid to be diverted from exports. Additional
ammonia to run increased granulation at the JPH-1 plant is now not expected required until September at the earliest.
The Gaschem Stade is expected back in Morocco mid-July to discharge a 23,000 mt OPZ cargo following delays in discharging her previous parcel due to high OCP ammonia inventories.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: FACT negotiating with Trammo after tender offer
FACT is negotiating with Trammo after receiving an offer from the trader at $490/mt CFR in its 7,500 mt import tender which closed June 30.
The buyer indicated that Trammo's offer provided discharge dates at the end of July whereas the tender stipulated delivery on or before July 15. FACT is keen to secure the cargo as early as possible while the price offer is deemed at least $40/mt above initial targets at $440-450/mt CFR.
FACT said its Udyogamandal ammonia facility continues to run as normal since production restarted early June but that there is tank space available for additional ammonia tonnes if purchased.
IFFCO said ammonia demand remains stable with little change in pricing. The buyer is taking delivery of 40,000 mt ex-TogliattiAzot off the Clipper Mars July 2 under a contract with Ameropa with the cargo priced around $430/mt CFR.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Taiwan: CPDC seeking additional cargo for August
CPDC is seeking offers for an August cargo outside contract deliveries, aiming for values around $450/mt CFR. Negotiations continue with Koch and other traders.
Concerns over available tank space in August have been somewhat assuaged as TFC does not intend to accept contract supplier Sabic’s offer to take a 15,000 mt cargo that month in addition to cargoes in July and September. Instead TFC may choose to import 6-7,000 mt from Sabic in August and then less than 23,000 mt the following month.
South Korea: Koch busy offering ammonia cargoes
Namhae said it has been approached by Koch offering a 5,000 mt spot cargo for mid-August delivery, off the Clipper Orion. The trader reportedly offered around $470/mt CFR which Namhae rejected. The buyer is instead seeking values nearer $450/mt CFR.
SFC is in negotiations with Koch regarding the delivery of a 30,000 mt contract cargo off the same vessel.
In the meantime, contract prices remain pegged around $460/mt CFR. SFC will receive 15,000 mt from Sabic off the Rosegas July 10-12.
Namhae will take delivery of 15,000 mt from Mitsubishi off the Viking River July 6 followed by 10,000 mt July 8-9 from Trammo off the Sanko Innovator. Marubeni will deliver 16,000 mt off the Bunga Kemboja July 13-14 and in early August 10,000 mt will be discharged again by Trammo.

ANALYSIS
The US barge market finally springs into action
The US is the one market to see real price movement this week with NOLA values moving as high as $430/st FOB after weeks of languishing below $420/st, attracting little or no attention.
The rally was due in no small part to positive movement in US crop prices. Price for corn, wheat and soybeans all increased sharply this week in a weather dominated market, with bullishly interpreted USDA data adding further support. Indeed the crop price index is now at its highest point since mid January.
At the same time concern over a potential shortage of product in the face of zero imports booked for the Fall season has supported the barge price increase. As prices move higher, imports will start to become more of a reality although as yet the differential to the global market is not quite narrow enough to prompt cargoes to be booked but it is probably just a matter of time. The widely expected Moroccan tonnes will almost surely load some time in August/early September.
Should Brazilian MAP demand not warrant any volume selling from Morocco through August, the US will look even more attractive to OCP. By mid September the peak Brazilian season will be over but Europe will yet be starting so outlets at that time will be sought for Moroccan tonnes. Maintaining market share in the US with new capacity coming onstream will surely be a crucial move going forward. Although OCP has been able to benefit hugely from production constraints in Tunisia, South Africa and Jordan, this trend may be short lived and OCP will need to re-establish its own key markets.
In India, a two tier market is beginning to appear with a clear differential between prices offerd by traders for Chinese product and those offered by producers for a direct sale. Producers are becoming more aggressive in the all-important Indian market, looking to remove the middle man where possible and reap the benefits of direct selling. This explains the higher prices offered in recent tenders/enquiries by traders compared with the sales made by producers.
The rupee has stabilised at around 63.5 against the dollar, relieving some of the pressure from importers and as such the market has stabilised in the mid-upper $470s-low $480s/mt CFR but sizeable July tonnage is yet to be priced. Importers are reluctant to price tonnes too far ahead given the tendency for rupee volatility and continued concern over potential rainfall through July and August.
Brazil remains the big disappointment in terms of phosphate demand this year. The lack of volume demand is putting renewed pressure on traders holding long positions, which is in turn putting renewed pressure on price levels. Current prices appear to be nearer the $490/mt CFR level although remain largely untested on limited business. However, hopes by suppliers of achieving $505/mt CFR for July have been extinguished as the market limps along, constrained by the dismal economic backdrop.
Highlights of the Week
∙NOLA price moves up with upper end at $430/st
∙Two tier market for Chinese DAP opens up in India between trader and producer prices
∙Brazilian market weak with MAP prices closer to $490/mt CFR
∙OCP secures more acid sales
∙GCT resumes production at La Skhira but Gabes remains down
∙Crop prices increase in US
Sulphur
∙Adnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $150/mt FOB Ruwais for July, up $5/mt from its June level, representing a delivered price to India in the low $160s/mt CFR. The price is roughly in line with market expectations, and follows recent increases in other postings.
Ammonia
∙Few price changes have been noted across the ammonia price index on a distinct lack of activity. Koch continues to buy up tonnage west of Suez but this is doing little to affect values
Short Term Outlook
Many in the market have already assumed that a final surge in import demand will not now be forthcoming from Brazil over the coming weeks. Whether it does or it doesn't, the combination of supply constraints in Tunisia, Jordan and South Africa plus good prospects for demand from both India and Pakistan and potentially the US should keep the market reasonably stable through the next couple of months. Should Brazil suddenly find some form before the end of its season, this could prompt prices to firm however this latter development is looking increasingly unlikely unless there is a sustained improvement in to the negative economic factors that weigh heavily over the market.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Small sales continue
Mosaic reports sales of small lots of DAP this week into South America at $470/mt FOB Tampa for July shipment.The price tag is at the bottom of the range seen in prior weeks. Substantial movement in the Tampa benchmark in either direction seems dependent on the extent of Brazilian buying in the coming weeks.
US Midwest: Demand over, fill is next concern
With seasonal applications of phosphate over and done with, distributors are looking at replacement costs for summer fill. Mosaic has stuck with its earlier indication of delivered values roughy in line with spot indications to retailers of $460/st FOB.However, the barge market is gaining ground, and it is possible the producer's expected target of $440/st FOB New Orleans plus freight to inland destinations might be possible despite the disappointing spring season. For this to occur the recent jump in corn values based on revisions by the US Department of Agriculture's forecasts will have to hold.
US NOLA: DAP barge quotes benefit from corn gains
Increases in prompt and forward corn prices are getting credit for higher DAP values this week at New Orleans. July barges were no lower than $425/st FOB at the end of the week, with Mosiac material selling at $430/st FOB and a trader sale setting the low end at $420/st FOB. Forward sales are cited at $426-428/st FOB. Offers from traders are creeping over $430/st FOB for August, but buyers have not been willing to support that price tag yet.
The bump in DAP values was creditied mostly to a more positive outlook for corn prices. The June 30 acreage and grain stocks reports generally were supportive of corn and even soybean values. Corn gained as much as $0.30/bushel June 30. However, by mid-day July 1, CME forward contract values through December 2015 were giving back $0.07-0.08/bushel of that gain.
MAP values are holding just $5-1/st above DAP at New Orleans, even though the supply picture for MAP going forward appears to be extremely tight.
US: DAP/MAP inventories building at end of Q1
The January-March 2015 US phosphate producer data recently provided by The Fertilizer Institute show an increase in producers' inventories at the end of Q1. This was likely due to weaker year-over-year demand for DAP and MAP in the US due to fewer corn acres and wet weather that affected crop choices in some areas.
At the end of January - based on 100% of US capacity reporting - producers' DAP/MAP inventories were 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5), up 1% from the close of the previous month, and 28% above end January 2014.
The February data reflected the same trend, with 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5) in producers' inventory at month's end, unchanged on January but up by 24% against February 2014. March 2015 inventories were 582,000 st P2O5 (527,987 mt P2O5), up by 2% on February and by 19% year on year.
Inventory levels for each of the three months were above the monthly production rates of 413,000 st P2O5, 389,000 st P2O5 and 400,000 st P2O5 respectively.
Total production between July-March reached 3.68 million st P2O5 (3.34 million mt P2O5), an increase of 2% compared with the previous year.
US producers' shipments in January of this year were 407,000 st P2O5 (369,208 mt P2O5), 11% less than December 2014 and 14% below January 2014.
February shipments were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt P2O5) 4% less than January 2015 but 7% more than the previous year. March shipments also were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt), even with February of this year but 8% less than March 2014.
During the first nine months of the current US fertilizer year, July-March, US producers' shipments of DAP/MAP were 3.5 million st P2O5 (3.2 million mt P2O5), down 7% from the prior year period.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Argentina: Prices weaken to nearer $500/mt CFR
Recent sales have been concluded in the range of $500-505/mt CFR with current offers said to be even lower. With Brazilian demand far lower than anticipated for the time of year, long positions are beginning to build prompting competitive offers of MAP from most origins , e.g. Australian, Russian and Chinese (YUC granular 11-52-0), into alternative markets.
Brazil: Market stalls and prices stay weak
The market in Brazil remains weak in the low $490s/mt CFR but these prices have not really been tested over the past week. Volumes are thin and demand remains limited. reports also suggest that inventories on the ground are healthy with imports arriving against previous sales and buyers reluctant to risk holding unnecessary stocks in the current economic climate.
The market remains very weak as yet another week goes by with little real demand although some are hoping that the increase in soybean prices this week might prompt some renewed interest.
Some suppliers are still looking to achieve at or above $500/mt CFR but these levels are not workable today with demand so slow. Part cargoes from trader longs are heard sold at significantly lower levels over the past couple of weeks and although sub $490/mt CFR is not currently evident, the market would certainly appear to be nearer $490 than $500/mt CFR today.
Reports indicate that Russian and Australian product is on offer in the low $490s/mt CFR if not lower and Ma'aden has a 40,000 mt cargo for H1 shipment to South America.
YUC is producing granular 11-52-0 in China and is indicating at or above $480/mt CFR which would equate to the low $500s/mt CFR Brazil on a direct sale basis. Eurochem too is indicating $485/mt CFR for new business but this also does not tally with recent or indeed offers being made into Brazil from current trader positions which would equate back to sub $470/mt FOB Baltic.
OCP has made no sales into Brazil during July and is not expected to do much if any volume business there until August if at all this season. Neither demand nor price prompts the normal volumes that OCP would expect to ship into Brazil at this time of year. In June it shipped 200,000 mt MAP/DAP preceded by 200,000 mt MAP/DAP/NPS 12-46-0+7S in May.
Mosaic continues to ship into its own system in Brazil but has not made any new spot sales here for a number of weeks. Based on its latest spot prices at $470 FOB US Gulf range and a freight of $17/mt, it would theoretically be the only major producer in a position to offer into Brazil at a competitive level.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP benefitting from supply constraints
OCP has added to its July line up this week with two additional sales of phosphoric acid comprising 15,000 mt solution to South Africa and 30,000 mt solution to Turkey equating to just over 50,000 mt DAP. Although
granulation has not yet started at the new JPH-1 plant, the phosphoric acid plant has been running for several weeks, some surplus acid could theoretically be made available between now and when the granulation begins towards the end of the quarter.
In the meantime, OCP remains comfortable going through July, as detailed in last week's Fertilizer Week report, with DAP/MAP sales to Turkey, South Africa, Algeria and Europe totalling as much as 210-230,000 mt plus a further 85,000 mt NPKs for Nigeria and other West Africa. The lack of Brazilian demand has been compensated for by the production issues in Tunisia, Jordan and South Africa which have opened up additional outlets for Moroccan DAP/MAP/TSP and acid in markets such as Turkey, South Africa, Europe, Bangladesh and of course India.
As the US NOLA price moves up, the chances of Moroccan tonnes loading in August become more likely.
Saudi: Port data show increase in May exports
The latest estimates indicate Saudi production and export rates close to capacity. Price levels in India for July are under discussion with buyers expecting a level close to $480/mt CFR or just above.
Data for the port of Ras al Khair show exports of fertilizer in May at 264,000 mt, the largest monthly volume for the year to date. Between January-April, monthly exports were mostly in the range of 180-190,000 mt with the exception of February which had dropped to 141,000 mt. Total exports between January-May from Ras al Khair totalled 960,000 mt.
For May, a total of 11 vessels were loaded and the breakdown by country included an estimated 160,000 mt for India, and 30,000 mt for Pakistan.
Total production capacity at MPC's Ras al Khair plant is 250,000 mt DAP/MAP per month.
Official data for June is not yet available but preliminary estimates suggest that around 220,000 mt was loaded last month, as per the table below.
For July, the only Indian shipment to date confirmed is the Kribhco cargo for Ma'aden loading in the last week. The price is not yet agreed and is currently under discussion. Further Saudi tonnes are expected for July from both Sabic and Ma'aden against agreements with Zuari, Chambal and IFFCO. As such production rates and exports are expected to remain close to capacity.
Price levels in India are still believed to be in the very low $480s/mt CFR for Saudi tonnes while in Pakistan recent sales have been in the mid $480s/mt CFR.
Tunisia: La Skhira restarts but not Gabes
Production has resumed at the TIFERT phosphoric acid plant at La Skhira but DAP production remains suspended at Gabes. Protestors have been blocking the railway lines into Gabes over the past month with a continual sit-in and as such the plant is unable to receive a regular supply of phosphate rock.
With a return to business at La Skhira, phosphoric acid shipments to the two Indian joint venture partners, GSFC and CIL, can be resumed for Q3. Shipments to date this year for India have been extremely limited due to the renewed problems to beset the industry since December 2014.
Meanwhile GCT has no DAP availability for its regular Q3 customers, namely Turkey and southern Europe. OCP has already stepped in to cover part of the shortfall from Tunisia for the Turkish market, specifically to supply Gubretas with 100,000 mt in July. If GCT's plant can start production over the coming weeks, Turkey and Europe, specifially southern Europe, will be the priorities.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: CIL books 50,000 mt Wengfu DAP for July
CIL purchased 50,000 mt DAP for July shipment direct from Wengfu, with the buyer claiming a price below $475/mt CFR. Neither of the two 50,000 mt cargoes required by CIL for August shipment has yet been booked. Trader offers meanwhile remain at higher prices, at or above $480s/mt CFR.
Against its enquiry of June 24 for 65,000 mt DAP and 35,000 mt NPK 10-26-26, Deepak received around 8 offers for the DAP mostly in the range of $480-485/mt CFR. Deepak subsequently countered at $475/mt CFR but as yet has not agreed any tonnes.
Against its tender of June 22 for 75,000 mt DAP for 1H August shipment, RCF has not yet made an award but is expected to make its next move by the end of the week. As already reported, it received six offers with the lowest submitted by Wilson International, backed by Yidu Xingfa, on 35,000 mt for shipment into Gangavaram at $483.00/mt CFR. MMTC, backed by Hubei Chuxing offered the next lowest for Gangavaram or Mundra, at seller's option, at $483.95 or $484.95 respectively. Rare Earth backed by YunnanHonxing, offered the lowest price for delivery to Mundra at $485.80/mt CFR.
The trader offers of around $483-484.00 into India equate back to between $468-470/mt FOB China depending on freight but exclude any trader's margin and provision for hedging. When taking these additional costs into account, the netback is closer to the $460/mt FOB China level.
Recent reported sales at the $478/mt CFR India level or lower are for panamax sales and generally concluded direct, i.e. without the need for any trader margin, thereby giving a netback in the low/mid $460s/mt FOB. These direct sales have proved more attractive not just to the suppliers but to the bigger buyers who are able to reap the benefits offered in the form of lower landed prices.
Any movement in the rupee will continue to have a direct impact on landed prices to India. Having crept above 64.2 against the rupee mid June, it has since settled back at around 63.6, bringing some relief to importers faced with the prospect of eroding margins once again.
Monsoon: Another positive factor to start the month with has been the level of June rainfall despite falling from a high of 28% above the LPA (Long Period Average), but still ending the month some 13% above. The heavy rains seen across much of the country have boosted reservoir levels that had been comparatively low from last year, in some cases to levels above the 10-year average, an extremely significant development going forward and for the Rabi season, should the monsoon fail to perform through Q3.
June rains account for just 18% of the average monsoon rainfall with July and August accounting for 33% and 29% respectively and the balance falling in September. Therefore even though the heavy June rains have encouraged a robust level of Kharif planting (up by 23% yoy as of last week) and boosted water levels, it is the coming weeks that will be the most crucial.
India: RCF opens price offers
RCF has opened price offers against its tender of June 22 for 75,000 mt DAP for H1 August shipment in two lots, 40,000 mt to Mundra, WCI and 35,000 mt to Gangavaram, ECI.
Price offers were as follows:
Pakistan: Data show need for 650,000 mt more DAP
Latest NFDC data show both P2O5 and DAP consumption for May recorded at a high of 68,000 mt P2O5 and 110,000 mt product respectively. Off-take for the first two months of the Kharif season, April-May, has been extremely positive with a 20% year-on-year increase in P2O5 usage and a 17% increase in DAP. DAP sales were also 57% higher than the four-year average for this period.
As such the NFDC has revised up its consumption estimate for the Kharif season to 629,000 mt, up from last month's estimate of 618,000 mt.
The latest NFDC report suggests a sizeable shortfall in imports for the current season but only takes into account those imports that have actually arrived into the country during April/May. The real import volume is much higher as documented over the past few weeks in Fertilizer Week and currently stands at an estimated 440,000 mt for the calendar year of which 83,000 mt is included in the opening balance and a further 65,000 mt as arrivals in April/May. Almost 300,000 mt has been booked for June/July shipment and hence added to the table below.
Overall consumption of DAP looking robust for the year and, barring any unforeseen negative variables, is expected to reach last year's volume of 1.7 million mt which necessitated imports of around 1.1 million
mt. Therefore we can expect a similar volume of imports for this year, prompting a requirement for up to 600- 650,000 mt to arrive before the end of this calendar year.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Vietnam: Market dominated by YUC material
The DAP market has been dominated by cross border sales of YUC green product priced below the CFR equivalent of $500/mt CFR HCM in bags. As such there is no interest in product from other origins either in or outside China.
Farmers prefer to buy the green or natural DAP from YUC, and if this is currently in the market, there is little interest in any other type of DAP. Even if at the same price as darker coloured DAP from China, (once favoured by the market) farmers seemingly will opt for the YUC product.
The netback on the YUC DAP is said to be around the low/mid-$470s/mt FOB China, but sales are concluded on a cross-border basis and as such are in extremely small lots.
China: Two-tier market in China as industry gets competitive
Wengfu's sale of a July panamax, allegedly in the mid $470s/mt CFR India would netback into the low/mid $460s/mt FOB China, well within the current price range as reported in Fertilizer Week. Panamax rates to India EC are close to $10/mt but this sale is for a 2 port discharge suggesting a slightly higher rate. A two-tier market is developing in India with Chinese product as traders struggle to compete with sales being concluded direct by the producers.
Over the past couple of weeks, trader offers of Chinese DAP into India appear to have been consistently higher than offers and indeed sales concluded by the producers who have sold direct to the buyer. Prices in recent Indian tenders have been at or above $480/mt CFR while sales of panaxes by the larger suppliers have been concluded in the upper $470s or potentially lower in the case of CIL's purchase. Traders are faced with limited margins and a more competitive stance from the industry.
Most recent sales to India have been concluded in the mid $460s/mt FOB China. There have been some sales of YUC DAP into Vietnam reported in the low $470s/mt FOB but these would appear to be cross
border tonnes sold in very small parcels and not large enough to be reflected in Fertilizer Week's price range.
YUC is producing gMAP 11-52-0 at its Tian'an Chemical plant, formerly known as Furui. It is currently producing the MAP on its two DAP trains but will switch back to DAP if demand does not support further production runs. The plant has an annual capacity for 600,000 mt DAP equating to around 50,000 mt per month. A price of $480/mt FOB or higher has been indicated for the 11-52-0 which would equate to the
low $500smt CFR Brazil and higher if including trader's margin. Current price ideas are in the $490s/mt CFR Brazil for 11-52-0 with limited demand.
Price indications for granular 11-44-0 for late July are nearer the $365/mt FOB level and remaining weak, reflecting waning demand from Brazilian buyers all too aware of time constraints in shipping product from China after mid July.
The phosphate industry will be maximising export sales, particulalry for DAP, between now and mid-August when demand from the domestic season will start to pick up to build supplies for the autumn season.
Rain has been an issue in China in recent weeks. According to Martell Crop Projections the North-Eastern province of Heilongjiang, responsible for around 18% of China's corn production, heavy rain that began in May has intensified through June, with rainfall at 150-200% of normal levels. This is said to have hampered corn planting and therefore DAP, NPK and urea consumption are all likely to be impacted.
PHOSPHORIC ACID
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: Talks underway on NW European Q3 acid contracts
OCP is currently negotiating Q3 phosacid contracts with its customers in NW Europe and hopes to finalise prices by next week. It is looking for an increase on the back of its recent $5/mt P2O5 increase achieved last week in India for Q3 and Q4.
To justify a further increase in Europe, OCP is citing a tight market, prompted by production constraints in Tunisia and South Africa.
OCP also reports two new sales of phosphoric acid with 30,000 mt solution to Turkey and 15,000 mt solution for South Africa, both for July shipment. The price was not disclosed.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: July arrivals not yet deterred by higher price
Close to 80,000 mt phosphoric acid solution is arriving into India during 1st week July with volumes boosted by a Senegalese cargo and another thought to originate from JIFCO/Jordan, both for IFFCO. The TIFERT
joint venture plant in Tunisia has resumed production after a two month stoppage and cargoes for CIL and GSFC should materialise from August if not before.
PHOSPHATE ROCK
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Rock import demand expected steady through Q3
Rock imports continue at a steady pace supported by more attractive production costs from the imported rock/sulphur route compared with imported phosphoric acid, particularly given the recent increase, albeit nominal, in acid prices for H2.
Even though sulphur prices have also edged up, the price differential remains relatively wide between the two production routes and as such, demand for rock should remain healthy through Q3.
NP/NPKS
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan: NPK imports down January-May
Japan imported 37,500 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 22% fall on the same period in 2014 and the lowest level for this period since 1997, according to GTIS.
During the period, South Korean imports from Namhae fell 42% to 19,000 mt while imports from Chinese NPK producers increased 49% to 13,500 mt.
The country imported just 4,000 mt of NPKs in May, with around half coming from Namhae.
SE Asia: NPK prices slightly lower with market out of season
Southeast Asian NPK 16-16-16 prices are seen at $395-415/mt CFR this week as a seasonal lull in demand and stiff competition lowers price levels.
In Thailand, prices are quoted in the $395-405/mt CFR range with prices in the other markets closer to the upper end of the SE Asian range, nearer $415/mt CFR.
Thailand imported 415,928 mt NPKs between January and May, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. During the period, Thailand imported 275,000 mt from Russia and 124,000 mt from Yara.
Imports were very low until May, when Thailand imported 110,000 mt compared with 26,000 mt a year previously. During May this year, Thailand imported around 50,000 mt each from Russian producers and from Yara.

ANALYSIS
Potash prices weaken as discipline falters in Brazil
Weaker prices are seen in most potash spot markets this week as suppliers fail to achieve their targets in Brazil and weak demand hits prices in the US and China.
In other news, the board at K+S rejected PotashCorp's takeover proposal on the grounds that the €41 per share offer undervalued the company and that PotashCorp had not alleviated worries over plans for the German company's salt operations and high-cost German mines. PotashCorp has yet to respond to the statement but has already informed K+S that it may decide to go past the board and offer to K+S shareholders the acquisition via a public takeover offer.
In the markets, suppliers price goals for June and July deliveries to Brazil have largely failed, with very few deals signed at $340/mt CFR. Most sources say that supplier discipline has failed to hold and quote prices at $325-335/mt CFR, many believe that suppliers will struggle to surpass $350/mt CFR levels by the end of Q3 unless there are significant changes to the market environment.
Demand has slowed across many potash markets in a seasonal lull. US NOLA barge deals cannot be seen above $320/st FOB but with BPC now considering holding off from deliveries in Q3 the market may be less oversupplied in the coming months.
The Chinese domestic market is also out of season and standard prices have fallen to RMB 1,980-2,100 ($319-338)/mt FCA.
In Southeast Asia foreign exchange rates continue to hold down potash prices with Malaysian potash deals still seen as low as $300-310/mt CFR. Major suppliers are staying out of the Malaysian market and focus on the other Southeast Asian markets where prices are seen in the $320-340/mt CFR range.
Despite weaker potash prices in Brazil, the US and the Chinese domestic market, suppliers are more confident of achieving their new price targets in the European market. As yet, the goal of €315-320/mt CIF gMOP has eluded potash producers but deals cannot be seen lower than €305/mt CIF this week in the European market.
In the UK, Sirius Minerals received approvals from the North York Moors National Park Authority to mine polyhalite in the UK. The company will now look for funding towards the £1.7 billion mine and aims to have a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.
Readers should also note that potash indicative prices have been updated this week to take into account new prices and freight levels entering Q3 2015. For most suppliers, the $10/mt contract increases in the Chinese and Indian standard markets have been largely offset by weaker spot prices through H1.
Highlights of the Week:
∙K+S board rejects PotashCorp takeover proposal
∙Sirius Minerals gets approval for £1.7 billion polyhalite mine
∙Brazil gMOP price down, $325-340/mt CFR v $330-340/mt CFR
∙US NOLA prices down, $320/st FOB v $320-325/st FOB
∙China domestic prices down, RMB 1,980-2,100/mt FCA v RMB 2,000-2,100/mt FCA
∙Europe gMOP prices up, €305-310/mt CIF v €300-310/mt CIF
∙Southeast Asian prices stable at $300-340/mt CFR
∙Europe SOP prices up, €470-520/mt FCA v €460-500/mt FCA
∙Sri Lankan MoA tender offers said to be around the $345/mt CFR with 180 days level
∙SDIC Luobupo stops SOP operations for maintenance
∙BPC and IPL sign MOU on potash deliveries
∙Uralkali Q1 revenues down 17% yr-on-yr at $720 million
Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade- weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.
MARKETS
MOP
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Lack of interest keeps market flat
The main story in the region remains the lack of interest in booking substantial fall tons compared to prior years due to carryover. Comments from distributors vary, with the divide primarily between those reporting more-than-typical volumes of granular potash and those reporting normal inventories.
Demand generally was better in the Midwest through the spring application season compared to other major US markets. Postings remain at $335-365/st FOB.
US NOLA: BPC shipments for fall in question
BPC, which re-entered the US market in the just completed US fertilizer year, has said it is not committed to ship granular potash in time for the US fall season.
The producer cites reports of higher inventory levels in the US supply chain at the end of the spring, and the lower prices seen in the US since the start of the spring season.
Previously traders had hoped to buy 160-200,000 mt of BPC potash in time for US fall sales. Assuming no cargoes arrive in time for the annual closure of the upper Mississippi River in October, then there would be no requirement for BPC cargoes to reach the US until February in order to participate in the spring season.
In the meantime, granular potash barges are cited around $320/st FOB New Orleans.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Colombia: Potash imports continue above average
Colombia imported 153,900 mt of potash between January and April, an 8% increase year on year, according to GTIS.
During the period, Colombia imported 72,000 mt from Canpotex, 60,000 mt from Uralkali, 15,000 mt from K+S and 7,000 mt from SQM.
In April, Colombia imported 54,000 mt of potash, a 7% increase, with 35,000 mt from Uralkali and 17,000 mt from Canpotex.
Uralkali recently confirmed around 15,000 mt of gMOP for delivery to Colombia in the $340s/mt CFR.
Brazil: Buyers continue to resist target prices
Suppliers have struggled to get their target $340-345/mt CFR prices for July deliveries to Brazil with potash deals seen as low as $325/mt CFR this week.
Suppliers had hoped to push up prices by $5-10/mt in each month leading into the autumn season but with high stocks, issues with farmers credit, low agricultural commodity prices and high competition, suppliers have struggled to sell product above $330/mt CFR.
Most sources say that supplier discipline has failed to hold and quote prices at $325-335/mt CFR. There are even unconfirmed deals signed as low as $320/mt CFR, highlighting the significant difficulties in the way of suppliers. With July shipments largely booked, suppliers are unlikely to increase their targets when it comes to August in light of the current market.
Canpotex and BPC recently confirmed deals for around 100-150,000 mt of potash at $340/mt CFR but most sources consider these to be outside the range for most potash deals and could include some kind of discount.
Suppliers hope that farmers will increase buying once new lines of credit are given in July and that worries of higher delays during autumn at the Brazilian ports may lead to increase buying in July and August.
However, many sources do not expect the new credit to filter into the hands of farmers until August at least and believe that market conditions currently make it unlikely that suppliers will achieve significant
price increases as we move through Q3.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Belarus: BPC and IPL sign MoU on potash deliveries
Belarusian Potash Company and Indian Potash Ltd. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding regular deliveries of potash for five years starting in 2016, Belarusian state news agency BelTA said on June 29.
"The document is further evidence of the close cooperation between Belarus and India. The memorandum implies regular supplies of potash from Belarus to the Indian market from 2016 to 2021," BPC's press service told BelTA.
IPL is believed to have agreed deliveries of 600,000 mt potash with BPC for the current fertilizer year along with optional agreements for another 100,000 mt.
BPC, which generally has a smaller market share in India than Canpotex or Uralkali, said that it expects the deal will strengthen its position in the Indian market and help develop the agriculture industry there.
The news comes as Indian buyer IFFCO also met BPC representatives this week regarding long-term supply deals. IFFCO Managing Director Dr Awasthi said that there had been "fruitful discussions about long-term supply".
IFFCO currently gets its potash fertilizer needs, believed to be around 500,000 mt a year, through IPL, so the long-term agreement between BPC and IPL may include some volumes destined for IFFCO.
Indian contract deals have already confirmed higher demand in this fertilizer year and news of future agreements may help India to combat its imbalance in nutrient application.
EUROPE
Europe: Suppliers more confident over price goals in Europe
Suppliers continue to target €315-320/mt CIF gMOP prices across Europe with little activity due to a seasonal lull in demand. Currently prices are quoted in the €305-310/mt CIF range.
Indications are that European buyers are less against the price increases than in Brazil and that €315/mt CIF levels may have already been achieved in some unconfirmed deals.
European potash prices were considered comparatively weak in Q1 as euro exchange rates hit very low levels. Suppliers managed to correct the prices and a slight euro resurgence has meant that gMOP prices are seen as high as $344/mt CFR at current exchange rates.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Sri Lanka: Tender offers seen around $345/mt level
Sri Lanka's Ministry of Agriculture tender for 28,700 mt of sMOP which closed on June 29 is expected to be awarded in the next few days.
Offers came in from a range of suppliers including Uralkali, BPC and APC at prices believed to be above the $345/mt CFR with 180 days credit level.
In February, the MoA's last tender for 24,000 mt potash was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd with Uralkali tonnage after they made an offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit. The product was delivered in May.
India: High imports arriving on new contracts
In the first 10 days of July, 150,000 mt of potash is scheduled to arrive in India as volumes from recently- signed contracts begin to filter into the country.
Of the volumes, 63,000 mt are going to Zuari via two BPC shipments and a 36,000 mt shipment from Canpotex. Canpotex is also sending a 31,500 mt shipment to RCF while BPC is sending one 36,750 mt shipment to IPL and one 15,000 mt shipment to TCL.
ICL recently signed contracts to supply 835,000 mt of potash including options to customers in India between April 2015 and March 2016. The deal meant that current estimates for firm contracts have reached as high
as 4.5 million mt compared to 3.9 million mt in the last fertilizer year. Total imports in the 2014/15 fertilizer year reached 4.2 million mt so potash imports in the current fertilizer year are likely reach at least 4.7-4.8 million mt and may be as high as 5 million mt.
The price on the new Indian contracts is $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit, a $10/mt rise on the previous year.
Inland, dealers and retailers are said to already be full with potash stocks and any slowdown in demand may put pressure on importers for higher discounts on the Maximum Retail Price. According to one source, dealers in the northern regions are offering discounts in the range of INR 1,500-2,000/mt ($24-32) on
the potash MRP with some importers currently at breakeven point for potash.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Thailand: Record potash imports continue through May
Thailand imported 338,765 mt of potash between January and May, 21% higher than the same period in 2014 and the highest ever imports during the five-month period, according to GTIS.
During the period, Thailand's potash imports from Canpotex were largely flat at 132,000 mt, but imports from BPD increased 20% to 93,500 mt and SQM sent 38,000 mt compared to zero in the same period 2014.
In May, Thailand imported an impressive 100,000 mt with 43,000 mt from Canpotex, 27,000 mt from SQM and 18,000 mt from BPC.
The country is considered highly-competitive market with prices currently quoted at $330-340/mt CFR.
Japan: Potash imports slow after strong Q1
Japan imported 230,000 mt of potash between January and May, an 11% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.
After January to April imports reached a five-year high, May imports were down 44% to 49,000 mt, including 25,000 mt from Canpotex, 8,000 mt from Uralkali and 6,500 mt from BPC.
The fall meant that January to May imports were down 11%. During the period, Japan's imports from Canpotex fell 20% to 164,000 mt but imports from Uralkali increased 87% to 27,500 mt and imports from BPC increased 36% to 15,000 mt.
Canpotex signed contract agreements to Japan for the first half of 2015 at an average price of more than $410/mt CFR but recent spot deals are believed to have been made at around $350/mt CFR. Canpotex is expected to announce prices for H2 shortly.
Southeast Asia: Forex rates continue to hit potash markets
Southeast Asian standard potash prices continue to be seen this week at $300-340/mt CFR with Malaysian currency depreciation continuing to hold down the low end of potash deals in the region.
Malaysian prices are seen around $300-310/mt CFR as slightly higher deals on a ringgit basis are offset by currency depreciation against the dollar. The Malaysian ringgit has weakened 18% against the dollar in the last 12 months.
However, the deals are said to be very small and major suppliers are staying out of the market until stocks deplete and demand increases. Most suppliers have their prices held at $320/mt CFR and higher for Malaysia.
With the market generally out of season deals are hard to come by in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Prices outside Malaysia remain in the $320-340/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia.
China: Domestic potash prices slip again on reduced demand
Slow purchasing activity and reduced demand have caused further price drops in the Chinese domestic potash market.
Offers remain stable with mainstream Russian red standard potash trading at RMB 2,000-2,020 ($323- 326)/mt FCA and the low-end of Russian red standard trading as low as RMB 1,980 ($319-320)/mt FCA. The high end of white 62% K2O MOP remains at RMB 2,100 ($338)/mt FCA.
QSL prices are seen stable at the levels indicated in its April 15 pricelist. QSL's price for standard crystal MOP is RMB 2,000/mt CPT, with standard powder MOP at RMB 1,960/mt CPT
Granular potash deals are seen at just RMB 2,050 ($330)/mt at port, a similar level to the current weak Brazilian and US NOLA prices.
May saw imports fall to 560,000 mt and June imports are also expected at a lower level. At the same time rail imports in May from Uralkali are said to be just 90,000 mt with June and July rail deliveries expected at a similar level.
During a conference call this week, Uralkali said rail to China has seen a significant decrease so far this year and previous expectations or 1.3 million mt of rail deliveries may not be reached in 2015.
SOP
EUROPE
Europe: SOP prices rise on tight market
Increased demand and tight supply in the European SOP market has again pushed up prices.
SOP prices in Northwest Europe are at €470-520/mt FCA with contract deals at the low end and limited spot business by K+S and Chinese suppliers made at the top end. There are some unconfirmed deals as high as €550/mt FCA.
Last week, Fertilizer Week reported that Chinese SOP producers doubled their year-on-year SOP exports in May bringing year-to-date exports to 54,000 mt compared to 13,700 mt in the same period last year, including 18,000 mt to Belgium.
Tessenderlo is still on track to increase production at the end of 2015 once it has converted its plant at Ham, Belgium, to a stand-alone SOP unit while other suppliers are likely to bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year, easing some of the tight availability.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan: SOP imports at high level so far in 2015
Japan imported 52,000 mt SOP between January and May, a 36% increase on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.
During the period, Japan imported 24,000 mt from K+S, 18,000 mt from Taiwanese suppliers, 3,800 mt from Namhae and 3,700 mt from Chinese producers.
In May, Japan's SOP imports doubled to 12,500 mt. During the month, Japan imported 12,500 mt from K+S, 2,500 mt from Taiwanese producers, 2,100 mt from Namhae and 2,100 mt from Chinese producers.
China: SDIC Luobupo stops for maintenance
Chinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo closed for planned summer maintenance last week and is unlikely to reopen until the end of August.
The company produced around 150,000 mt SOP in May, bringing its January to May production to 850,000 mt. Chinese SOP prices were last seen around RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT.
NPKS
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan: NPK imports down January-May
Japan imported 37,500 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 22% fall on the same period in 2014 and the lowest level for this period since 1997, according to GTIS.
During the period, South Korean imports from Namhae fell 42% to 19,000 mt while imports from Chinese NPK producers increased 49% to 13,500 mt.
The country imported just 4,000 mt of NPKs in May, with around half coming from Namhae.
Southeast Asia: NPK prices slightly lower with market out of season
Southeast Asian NPK 16-16-16 prices are seen at $395-415/mt CFR this week as a seasonal lull in demand and stiff competition lowers price levels.
In Thailand, prices are quoted in the $395-405/mt CFR range with other markets making up the higher end of the range.
Thailand imported 415,928 mt NPKs between January and May, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. During the period, Thailand imported 275,000 mt from Russian producers and 124,000 mt from Yara.
Imports were very low until May, when Thailand imported 110,000 mt compared with 26,000 mt in May 2014. During May, Thailand imported around 50,000 mt each from Russian producers and from Yara.

FINANCIALS
Migao Corp. see's 20% increase in yearly revenues
Chinese speciality potash fertilizer producer Migao Corp. said its revenues in the financial year ending March 31 were CAD 444.5 million ($356 million), a 20% increase year on year as higher sales and prices helped the company.
As a result, Migao swung to a gross profit of CAD 47 million in the year compared with a gross loss of CAD 9.6 million in the previous year.
The SOP and NOP producer said that market conditions for SOP were strong throughout 2015 compared with one year ago with higher average selling prices, but that higher sales were offset by decreases of roughly CAD 51 million in its sales of compound fertilizers and ammonium chloride.
The company said that Chinese demand for NOP, compound fertilizers and ammonium chloride were weak through the year but that appreciation of the Chinese Yuan against the Canadian dollar also contributed to the dollar-based revenue increases.
In the quarter ending March 31, revenues were $208.7 million, an 11% fall on the previous year due to lower average selling prices in all products except SOP, couple with lower sales volumes for all products.
Migao announced earlier this year that the second phase of its NPK and NOP production line with EuroChem will be launched this year. In total, the joint venture will produce as much as 60,000 mt/year NOP and as much as 200,000 mt/year NPKs in Yunnan by the end of 2015, with both parties having a 50% stake in the deal.
Uralkali struggles in first quarter as revenues fall 17%
Russian potash producer Uralkali's Q1 revenues fell 17% year on year to $720 million due to lower production and reduced sales volumes.
The company's production in Q1 fell 8% to 2.7 million mt following the loss of output from its SK-2 mine after flooding at the end of 2014. Sales volumes during the quarter were at the even-lower level of 2.5 million mt, a 17% fall year on year as subdued demand in key markets hit sales. The company attributed lower demand to currency fluctuations, lower crop prices and farmers using up existing stocks.
Despite this, some of the reduction in sales volumes was offset by an increased average export price of $256/mt, up 19% year on year after very low potash prices in Q1 2014 following the break-up of Uralkali's alliance with Belaruskali.
The company said it expected shipments to increase in H2 following a draw-down of inventories and as the autumn application seasons take place, particularly in Brazil where suppliers are targeting price increases in the next few months.
Uralkali expects potash demand in 2015 to fall to 58-59 million mt from 63 million mt in 2014.
The company said it continued to implement its plan to mitigate the damage following the flooding at SK-2. It is pumping out brine and strengthening the walls between the flooded mine and the nearby Solikamsk-1 site, but the sinkhole which opened near the mine has now tripled in area since February to 118 metres by 129 metres.
Uralkali said that during the spring thaw, average brine inflow between March 6 and June 29 was around 300 cubic metres per hour.
If there is no significant increase in flooding, Uralkali expects production to be higher than originally planned for 2015, Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Osipov said during a June 29 conference call. The company is managing some production from SK-2 in the clean-up process and Osipov said that output could reach 10.4-10.8 million mt in 2015 rather than the original estimate of 10.2 million mt, made following the initial mine incident. Uralkali produced 12.1 million mt in 2014.
The news comes as the Russian producer announced on June 23 that it reviewed the results of a recent share-buyback programme and may de-list from the London Stock Exchange.
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
K+S rejects PotashCorp takeover proposal
The board at K+S rejected its proposed takeover by PotashCorp, arguing that it does not reflect the fundamental value of K+S and was "not in the best interest of the company".
K+S confirmed that PotashCorp has offered €41 per share to acquire all of the outstanding shares in the company via a written proposal.
"Not only does this proposal undervalue our potash and magnesium products and our salt business, it completely disregards the value of our Legacy Project," K+S chief executive Norbert Steiner said in a statement.
The offer represented a 40% premium to K+S's share price when it was made public on June 25 but since then shares have rallied and are currently seen at €37.
K+S pegged the value of Legacy at up to €21 per share and said this value is not reflected in their current share price.
The German miner has already invested more than €2 billion in the project, with first production expected by the end of 2016 and positive cash flows planned from 2017 onwards.
"We believe PotashCorp is trying to take advantage of the valuation gap to take over K+S and gain control over Legacy," Steiner added.
The K+S board said the proposals are not in the best interest of the company, noting that PotashCorp has not shown it has a sustained interest in continuing the company's fertilizer and salt businesses in their current form.
"PotashCorp has made no firm commitments to protect the interests of the more than 14,000 employees of K+S worldwide. Despite repeated requests to address this question, PotashCorp's answers have remained vague," Steiner added.
Last week, K+S said that PotashCorp informed the company that it may decide to go past the board and offer to K+S shareholders the acquisition via a public takeover offer.
For more information on the proposed takeover please see Fertilizer Week's recent Insight on the offer.

BHP Billiton hands responsibility for Jansen potash project to Valle
BHP Billiton has shifted the leadership of its major Jansen potash development project in Canada to group project-management executive Dean Dalla Valle.
The company named Valle as chief commercial officer and said he would oversee the Jansen development rather than petroleum president Tim Cutt. Valle takes over management of the asset from August 1.
Shaft excavation is continuing at the 10 million mt/year project and the overall project is running within budget and roughly 40% complete. It is believed to be nearing 50% complete.
In February, chief executive officer Andrew Mackenzie said that BHP is likely to make a decision within 4 or 5 years on whether to move towards production at the site and BHP continues to plan an investment of $2.6 billion in the project from 2013 through 2016, with annual spending of less than $500 million on Jansen.
"Its all about timing ourselves into the market," Valle said in an interview with Bloomberg in Sydney on July 2. "This has the potential to be a material business in the future, in a market that's growing."
PROJECTS
Fired Karnalyte Resources CEO takes back control
Former chief executive of struggling potash junior Karnalyte Resources, Robin Phinney has reassumed control of the Canada-based company and wants to resurrect its proposed Wynard potash solution mine.
A majority of Karnalyte shareholders last week voted to replace the board of directors with six new directors, including Phinney.
The decision marks a U-turn for the resource company after it wrote off its investment in Wynard earlier this year, arguing that the mine would not get enough financing amid lower potash prices.
In May, the company stepped back from the decision, saying it was prepared to make some concessions to avoid a legal battle with Phinney and a group of shareholders but it seems shareholders were so against the decision to write-off Wynard that they reinstated Phinney.
"We are well positioned to bring the Project to the next level, and most importantly, we have a Framework Agreement with KRN's largest shareholder, Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd., to negotiate a major round of financing to fund the project which could be transformative for the Company," Phinney said in a recent statement.
Karnalyte continues to propose to produce 625,000mt/year of potash initially through solution mining before ramping up to 2.1 million mt/year of potash.
Sirius gets go-ahead for York Potash project
North York Moors National Park Authority's planning committee has agreed to approve Sirius Minerals' plan for a £1.7 billion polyhalite mine in the UK.
The committee voted 8 in favour of the potash mine, with 7 against the plans, according to a spokesman from Sirius Minerals.
The committee listened to arguments for and against the mine in the morning of 30 June before making its decision. The meeting comes two weeks after the North York Moors planning authority released a report highlighting certain problems with the application regarding environmental issues but not making a decision on whether it should go ahead.
The decision had already been delayed until May from the start of this year and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council has already given the go ahead for the section of the mine transportation system in its jurisdiction.
All of the other major approvals have been given apart from Sirius' application for harbour facilities, which is currently being examined by the planning inspectorate.
The company will now move forward with construction of the site, towards a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.
Shares in Sirius are up roughly 60% since the decision.

ANALYSIS
Middle Eastern sellers nudge up prices further
There were further indications of stronger sulphur prices this week as more Middle Eastern sellers posted July prices.
Tasweeq announced its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) for July at $149/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $8/mt from its June level. Then Adnoc posted an official selling price (OSP) of $150/mt FOB Ruwais for July, up $5/mt from its June level. The prices are in line with the upper end of the current assessed ranges in China and India respectively.
Earlier this month, Aramco Trading posted its July price at $144/mt FOB Jubail, up $2/mt from its June price.
Chinese prices were stable on the week, though some sources reported higher bids and offers. No trades have yet broken the $165/mt CFR barrier.
Indian sulphur prices were also stable on a lack of fresh activity, but price ideas diverged as some argued that weak demand should lead to lower prices despite price movements elsewhere.
In other regions, spot markets were also mostly quiet.
Senegal is set to receive 25,000 mt from Poland, and an enquiry for 25,000 mt was heard from Vietnam as well.
Brazilian prices were assessed stable with no new deals reported, while new vessel arrivals were listed for late July for Anglo American and Vale.
In sales tenders, both Reliance and Tasweeq issued their latest tenders, closing at July 6 and 14 respectively.
In contract news, those European Q3 contracts that have settled have been unchanged from Q2, and those yet to settle are also expected to roll over.
Discussions for North African sulphur contracts for Q3 are still ongoing, though negotiating parties hope they will be finalised next week or the week after.
Highlights of the week:
∙Tasweeq posts $149/mt FOB for July, up $8/mt
∙Adnoc posts $150/mt FOB for July, up $5/mt
∙ME spot sales up to $150/mt FOB
∙China yet to break $165/mt CFR barrier
∙Indian price ideas diverge on weak demand
∙Senegal to receive 25,000 mt from Poland
∙Vietnam seeking 25,000 mt
∙Reliance issues latest tender
∙Tasweeq's latest tender to close July 14
∙European Q3 contracts settling at rollovers
MARKETS
SULPHUR
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Spot assessed stable; more arrivals scheduled
Brazilian spot prices remain pegged at $155-160/mt CFR following recent business in this range.
Brazilian contract levels for Q3 have yet to be confirmed by negotiating parties.
New sulphur cargoes on vessel arrivals lists included 35,499 mt for Anglo American at Santos’s Termag terminal on the Arietta from Qatar via Nitron and 35,000 mt for Vale at Rio Grande’s Tiplam terminal on the Sky Magnolia from Ust-Luga via Trammo. These have ETAs of July 21 and 22 respectively.
There is also 42,000 mt due at Termag July 23 on the Cymbeline via Oxbow from an undisclosed seller to an undisclosed buyer.
As previously reported, Vale has recently received several cargoes. Trammo sent 33,500 mt from Ust Luga on the Vipava with an ETA of June 24, having sent 33,651 mt on the Mandarin Dalian for arrival on June 12.
Oxbow sent 31,500 mt on the Pacific Calm from Louisiana for arrival on July 2, having previously sent 38,662 mt from Beaumont on the Orange River for arrival May 23.
Shell sent 38,000 mt on the Ocean Eternity from Beaumont for arrival June 14, while KPC was sending 31,500 mt on the RM Dynasty from Shuaiba to arrive July 24.
All of the above arrivals are for Tiplam at Rio Grande.
Anglo American received 38,850 mt from Ust Luga via Trammo on the Kouyou at the Termag Terminal of Rio Grande June 18, having previously received 36,489 mt on the Ultra Esterhazy from Corpus Christy via Koch on May 26.
EUROPE
Europe: Q3 contracts settling at rollovers
Several negotiating parties have confirmed settling their Q3 sulphur contracts at a rollover from Q2.
Other sources said that while they have not yet settled their contracts, they are likely to settle at a rollover within the coming week.
Sellers were hoping to reclaim some of the declines from Q2 settlements, while some buyers were hoping to achieve further decreases as they did not believe concessions for Q2 were large enough.
Most view the market as balanced, with firm demand and sufficient supply.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: Spot up to $150/mt FOB
Spot availability of sulphur from the Middle East was reported as relatively tight, adding support to current minor price increases.
One trader said they had already bought two 35,000 mt cargoes at $150/mt FOB, one for July shipment and the other for August shipment.
Meanwhile, no settlements for Q3 contracts from Middle Eastern suppliers have yet been confirmed.
Qatar: Tasweeq's latest tender due July 14
Tasweeq’s latest tender for 35,000 mt is set to close on July 14, according to market sources.
The seller’s previous sales tender for 35,000 mt, which closed on June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146- 147/mt FOB.
Senegal: Polish product bought in $160s/mt CFR
Senegal is receiving 25,000 mt of sulphur from Poland. The product was reportedly priced in the $160s/mt CFR.
Morocco: Q3 talks yet to conclude
Discussions for North African sulphur contracts for Q3 are still under discussion, though negotiating parties hope they will be finalised next week or the week after.
Meanwhile, prices for Moroccan business were pegged in the $140s/mt CFR, though OCP is not currently active in the spot market as it is reportedly covered to late August.
UAE: Adnoc posts $150/mt FOB July sulphur OSP
Adnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $150/mt FOB Ruwais for July, up $5/mt from its June level.
This represents a delivered price to India in the low $160s/mt CFR.
The price is roughly in line with market expectations, and follows recent increases in other postings.
It follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for July at $149/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $8/mt from its June level.
Qatar: Tasweeq announces July sulphur QSP at $149/mt FOB
Tasweeq announced its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) for July at $149/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $8/mt from its June level.
Earlier this month, Aramco Trading posted its July price at $144/mt FOB Jubail, up $2/mt from its June price.
The announcement follows Tasweeq's most recent sales tender for 35,000 mt, which closed June 16 and was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB.
The new QSP equates to delivered prices in China in the mid-$160s/mt CFR, at the upper end of the range currently deemed achievable.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Prices stable as direction debated
Indian sulphur prices remained assessed at $160-165/mt CFR given a lack of fresh business.
Demand remained weak, and some in India believe that prices there will decline as a result. But this would be directionally opposite to price movements elsewhere in the world, and seems unlikely following Adnoc’s increase of its OSP for July.
Some sources believe demand will pick up again in late July.
There were no new vessels on the arrivals list this week.
India: Reliance issues latest 25,000 mt tender
Reliance issued its latest tender for 25,000 mt with a laycan of July 24-28. The tender closes July 6. The seller’s last 25,000 mt tender, which closed May 25, was reportedly awarded to Sumstar at just above $142/mt FOB.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Prices stable and inventories lower
There was talk of delivered prices in China reaching the high $160s/mt CFR, but no business has yet been reported above $165/mt CFR, though two traders reported deals as high as this level. Traders reported bids as high as $163-165/mt CFR.
In the domestic market, granular prices at major ports were mostly around RMB 1,260-1,270/mt FCA, which is equivalent to the high $160s/mt CFR.
Lump sulphur is traded in a RMB 1,200-1,220/mt FCA range, with supply heard slightly tight.
Sinopec’s Puguang did not adjust its prices, leaving quotes at RMB 1,250/mt FCA at Wenzhou port and RMB 1,210/mt EXW. Railway transport has been resumed from its plant, diminishing the chance of any stock buildup.
Port inventory remained around 930,000 mt. Few vessel arrivals are expected in the immediate future so the stock level may fall back to 900,000 mt or even lower in the next week.
Vietnam: Traders report 25,000 mt enquiry
Traders reported demand from Vietnam for 25,000 mt of sulphur, though it was not yet clear whether this was a tender or merely a spot enquiry.
Sources in Vietnam said that recent business was heard around $163-164/mt CFR, but market participants believed that prices might now be slightly higher than this, though not much.
Japan: May sulphur exports down 4.6%
Japan’s May exports of sulphur declined 4.6% year on year to 96,040 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year down 6% at 496,766 mt.
The vast majority of the May tonnes, 90,473 mt, went to China.
Other destinations included Indonesia (3,505 mt), South Korea (1,306 mt), and Thailand (732 mt).

ANALYSIS
Prices steady but signs of possible declines to come
Sulphuric acid markets remained roughly balanced with prices unchanged week on week, but there were signs of possible declines in the weeks to come.
Most market participants continued to agree with the current assessed range of $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe for spot exports, but one buyer indicated that they had received offers from NW Europe at $25/mt FOB.
Although some said availability remained relatively tight, others believed it had improved.
On the demand side, Brazil is currently the key buyer of European spot. Prices to there have been unchanged for several months, with Mosaic’s recent 12,000 mt tender reportedly awarded in the mid- $80s/mt CFR. Meanwhile, Petrobras has indicated that it will decide on its 60,000 mt tender on Friday July 3, though whether it takes all, some, or none of the total volume at this stage will likely depend on offer levels.
Morocco is not currently active on the spot market due to its reduced acid requirement, though sellers are confident the buyer would consider buying if a deal were sufficiently attractive.
The US has remained absent from the spot market.
European Q3 contracts were reported at a rollover, in line with expectations.
In the other key spot export market of East Asia, prices also seemed likely to dip pending any unexpected surprises.
Although no firm indications have yet suggested a decline in the $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, at least the upper end of this range seems unlikely to be achieved given current spot demand levels.
Indian buyers have reduced their prompt requirements and their prices ideas, and the upcoming FACT tender will give a better indication of current levels. One trader suggested prices to India as low as $10-16/mt FOB Japan, but other market participants were dismissive of such levels.
The Chilean spot market remains quiet, and market participants are waiting to see if demand there surfaces.
Other potentially market-moving events in the near future will be the restart of PASAR, likely within the next couple of weeks, and Fertinal’s requirement for three cargoes for Q4. The former will likely be bearish, at least in the medium term, while the latter could be more bullish, particularly given the expectation of large turnarounds at Asian smelters in Q4.
Meanwhile, Japan’s May exports of sulphuric acid jumped 51.6% year on year to 258,432 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year up 2.6% at 1.18 million mt.

∙Offers from NW Europe reported as low as $25/mt FOB
∙Lacklustre Indian demand leads to lower price ideas
∙PASAR yet to restart
∙Japanese May exports jump 51.6%
Base Metals
Base metals were again down overall week on week, as concerns over a potential Greek default on sovereign debt and a possible eurozone exit continued to weigh heavily on markets. LME copper was at $5,755/mt for cash.
DAP & Sulphur
Unsurprisingly there is little discussion of US acid or liquid sulphur pricing ahead of the US Independence Day holiday. Serious talks are more likely to start next week regarding liquid sulphur, with some knock-on result for acid values in the US Gulf.
Further signs of slightly higher sulphur spot prices emerged this week, as Tasweeq posted its July QSP at $149/mt FOB, up $8/mt, and Adnoc posted its July OSP at $150/mt FOB, up $5/mt. Spot sales from the Middle East were reported as high as $150/mt FOB, though CFR levels in China and elsewhere were mostly stable on the week.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices slipped slightly to $1,730-1,750/mt CFR China this week after being stable for six weeks following increases that began in mid-January. In recent days caprolactam June 2015 contract prices were fully settled at $1,770-1,810/mt CFR at sight in Taiwan and at $1,780-1,800/mt CFR basis 90 days in China. Sinopec concluded its June contract at RMB13,850/mt while DSM/Nanjing settled at RMB14,100/mt.

SULPHURIC ACID
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Petrobras yet to decide on 60,000 mt tender
Petrobras has indicated that it will make a decision regarding its tender for 60,000 mt sulphuric acid this Friday, July 3, according to market sources.
Sources were not certain how much, if any, of the volumes the buyer would commit to, but suggested it would be more likely to commit if the offered levels were below current spot prices in the $80s/mt CFR.
Petrobras needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.
Mosaic’s recent tender for 12,000 mt sulphuric acid, which closed on June 18 and was previously heard in the high $80s/mt CFR, was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR to a European producer.
Market participants are expecting further Brazilian enquiries in July, but nothing firm has emerged yet.
Port data showed that Yara received 18,000 mt at Rio Grande via Trammo from Antwerp on the Chemroad Hope May 17.
EUROPE
Europe: Q3 contracts settle at rollover
European Q3 contracts for sulphuric acid have been settled unchanged from the previous quarter, several sources confirmed.
One seller said that they achieved a single small increase, but all of their other contracts were a rollover.
Market participants agreed with the assessed range of €57-80/mt CFR, though the upper end of the range will represent only a small minority of settlements.
Sources saw the market as balanced to tight.
Europe: FOB spot steady but indications either side
European spot prices for export were assessed unchanged based on recent business, though there were price ideas either side of the current $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe range.
The most recent reported sale was Mosaic’s 12,000 mt tender, which closed June 18 and was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR to a European producer. The price is in line with Brazilian sales of the past several month.
One consumer reported offers as low as $25/mt FOB from Belgium. While some said this seemed too low, others said that long loading times might push freights for Belgian sales high enough to reduce netbacks to such a level.
Another trader suggested that business up to $40/mt FOB NW Europe was possible, depending on the port, but others argued that spot prices on current European sales would not reach anywhere near this high.
For now the market appears roughly balanced.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP out of acid spot market
Morocco remains absent from sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced considerably and are currently met by term contracts.
Buyer price ideas were in the low $40s/mt CFR, and spot offers to Morocco from European sellers have reportedly declined in recent weeks.
The buyer reports that its requirement has declined to around 30,000-40,000 mt/month, well below the levels that it has imported over the past year, which averaged around 80,000 mt/month. It is understood that these requirements can be met by current long term contracts.
CRU expects Morocco’s imports for 2015 to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.
Morocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Price ideas lower as demand weakens
Price ideas for Indian sulphuric acid have weakened as a result of the current reduction in spot demand, though market participants are awaiting firmer indications from the upcoming FACT tender.
One trader suggested a current spot price for India of $10-16/mt FOB Japan.
But others argued that even the recent purchase by PPL in the $50s/mt CFR does not net back to a level as low as $16/mt FOB.
Spot price ideas were generally pegged in the $50s/mt CFR, down from recent levels in the $60s/mt CFR or even higher.
This suggests that the upper end of the current assessed range of $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea may no longer be achievable for East Asian spot sellers and the assessment is likely to decline pending further information.
FACT’s tender for 14,000 mt for delivery at Kochi on or before August 31 closes on July 9.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan/South Korea: FOB prices stable, may inch down
East Asian spot export prices were assessed unchanged at $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, but are likely to decline slightly over the coming weeks given improved availability and less prompt spot demand.
Although one source suggested prices to India at $16/mt FOB Japan, others said this would not be achievable, and recent Indian prices remain pegged in the $50s/mt CFR at the lowest.
Spot availability following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi's Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko's Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc's Onahama smelter.
Then in Q2 Korea Zinc's Onsan smelter shut for maintenance, as did the PASAR smelter in the Philippines.
A key driver of increased spot prices has been Indian prompt demand, but this appears to have diminished somewhat.
PASAR is still under maintenance and is likely to restart within the next two weeks. Much uncertainty centres on how much it is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts. Although PASAR’s overall production for the year is not likely to be very different to its 2014 output when taking account the shutdown period, timing may mean that the market feels longer for a period in Q3.
Later in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters, which will remove large volumes from the market.
Japan: May exports jump 52%
Japan’s May exports of sulphuric acid jumped 51.6% year on year to 258,432 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year up 2.6% at 1.18 million mt.
The Philippines remained the key destination for Japanese acid, taking 112,049 mt of the May tonnes.
Chile was the next largest importer, taking 60,837 mt, followed by India with 46,624 mt.
Indonesia took 18,879 mt, Thailand took 12,020 mt, and Taiwan took 8,002 mt. The volume to Indonesia is the largest monthly volume from Japan to that country since March 2014.
