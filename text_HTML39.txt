○MIIT Hosted Symposium on Fertilizer Industry’s Economic Situation July 17
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology organized a symposium on July 17 to take a closer look at the problems challenging the country’s fertilizer industry. The country’s key fertilizer makers, including Sinofert, Kingenta, Yuntianhua, Hubei Yihua, JAMG Henan Jinkai, Wengfu Group, Liaoning Huajin and Guizhou Kailin, were invited to send representatives to the conference. Shandong Province’s fertilizer department, Hebei Province’s fertilizer department, CNCIC, CNFA and CPCIA also sent representatives.
The key fertilizer makers reported on their operations, talked about their difficulties and made suggestions.
The country’s fertilizer production and exports have increased this year. According to the NBS, in the first half of this year, China produced 24.321 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer (N 100%), up 3.7% y/y, of which 16.798 million tons was urea, up 6.1% y/y; the country’s 1H phosphate fertilizer output was 9.563 million tons (P2O5), up 12.8% y/y; and the 1H potash fertilizer output was 2.814 million tons (K2O), up 11.1% y/y.
China’s fertilizer industry’s overall operating income for the first five months of this year was RMB 371.83 billion, up 7.5% y/y, with a profit of RMB 10.99 billion, up 31.1% y/y.
○Issues in China’s Nitrogen Fertilizer and Methanol Industry Operations
At CNFA’s 2015 China Nitrogen Fertilizer and Methanol Conference held July 16-18 in Erdos city of Inner Mongolia AR, GU Zongqin, head of CNFA, pointed out four issues in the country’s nitrogen fertilizer and methanol industry operations:
1 Capacity is in surplus. Overheated construction of new fertilizer and methanol plants around the country has resulted in average annual capacity growth of 5% for nitrogen fertilizer and 14% for methanol from 2011 to 2015. The country’s average nitrogen fertilizer plant operating rate is about 76%, and the average methanol plant operating rate is only about 66%.
2 The nitrogen fertilizer product structure needs improvement. Efficiency-enhanced fertilizers and special fertilizers are to be further developed to increase the country’s fertilizer efficiency.
3 Some key technologies are to be developed. Efforts are to be made to raise the technological level in the nitrogen and methanol industries, especially for urea production, large compressors and air separation.
4 Operating costs are steadily getting higher. From 2011 to 2015, the prices of natural gas for nitrogen fertilizer
production have increased by 56%; the prices of electricity have increased by 42%; and the prices of rail delivery of nitrogen fertilizers have increased by 65%. In the same period, expenditures for marketing nitrogen fertilizers increased by 104%; expenditures for management increased by 32%; expenditures for financing increased by 103%; and expenditures for banks’ interest increased by 107%. The enterprises face greater challenges.
○2015 World Potash Conference on July 9-11 in
Golmud of Qinghai Province
2015 World Potash Conference was held on July 9-11 in Golmud City of Qinghai Province, with about 800 people from nine countries attending. This event was organized jointly by China Inorganic Salt Industry Association’s Potash Branch, Qinghai Salt Lake Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the government of Golmud City.
On the afternoon of July 9, XIN Guobin, vice governor of Qinghai Province, opened the conference. Key speeches were given by LI Yongwu, head of China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation; PAN Aihua, vice director of the department of raw materials at MIIT, and WU Mingjue, head of China Inorganic Salt Industry Association.
In his speech, LI Yongwu said that in the coming five years, China’s potash industry will improve its industrial structure, continue to develop the country’s potash bases in Qinghai Province and Xinjiang AR, and strengthen the development of overseas potash bases. On July 10, nearly twenty experts made very challenging presentations.
The attendees of the conference agreed that a mechanism should be established for stockpiling potash fertilizers in the off seasons, when prices are low in international markets.
○CNFA’s July 15 Conference for Renewing Technical
Committee
China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association held a work conference on July 15 in Erdos City of Inner Mongolia AR to renew its technical committee. The conference was chaired by KONG Xianglin, former director of the CNFA’s technical committee. GU Zongqin, head of the CNFA, was elected as the director of the new technical committee, which has 84 technical members.
Vice directors of the CNFA’s new technical committee are LIU Jincheng, deputy president of Hebei Yangquan Coal Zhengyuan Chemical Group; LI Xuchu, vice president of Sichuan Jinxiang Sairui Chemical Ltd; MO yuan, vice general engineer of CNPC Ningxia Petrochemical Ltd; LI Zhijian, director of the fertilizer department at the Petroleum and Chemical Planning Institute; CAO Zhangao, general engineer of the CNFA.

Highlights this week
Urea markets down
Ammonium sulfate markets fluctuating slightly
DAP markets steady
Sulfur markets stable
MOP markets still unchanged
Exchange Rate: USD 1 = RMB 6.2
Urea
Production
China’s prill urea output was 749.9kt during the third week of July, up 2.13% from the week before. Granular output was down slightly by 1.08%, reaching 159.5kt. According to statistics of 22 July, daily urea output was 182.2kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 70.9%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 78.73%, while gas-based producers’ average is 52.23%.
Domestic market
Unsurprisingly, domestic urea markets started to quieten down because a seasonal agricultural cycle ended. At this stage, urea shipments in the main regions remain weak; prices dropped again. Industrial demand is also slight. Some
urea makers expressed concern about excess inventory. Considering the low export prices, they tend to reduce their shipments to seaports and wait to see the market develop in August.
In North China, Hebei Province’s urea markets were stable; some urea makers stopped production and overhauled. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $263-266/t. In East China, Jiangsu Province’s urea market prices were unchanged. Local shipments were normal; but the season’s agricultural demand came to an end. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $285-294/t. In Central China’s Hubei Province, local urea markets remained weak; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $277-282/t. In Southwest China, urea prices in Sichuan Province dropped somewhat; corn fertilizer application has ended. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $279-287/t.
Page 3
Urea inventories in the main seaports amount to 508,000 tons, up only 1,000 tons from last week; of that, 200,000 tons is in Yantai Port, 40,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 60,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port, 70,000 tons in Rizhao Port, 60,000 tons in Jinzhou Port, 24,000 tons in Yingkou Port and 39,000 tons in Lianyungang Port.
Raw materials
Domestic anthracite markets still remained weak and prices kept steady. Sales in most of the main regions were discouraging. Demand remained slack. Some coal companies planned to adjust prices, but they tended to keep the prices strong.
North China coal sales were also sluggish, as buyers remained cautious. Worries about local coal inventory levels increased gradually. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $123-127/t in Yangquan and Jincheng, the same as last week. In Central China, Henan Province
anthracite prices dropped a bit, by $1-2/t; agricultural demand was weak. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices were $149/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $151/t in Yongcheng. Southwest China’s anthracite markets were normal; some producers in Guizhou Province set cautious coal production rates. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $119/t.
Ammonium Sulfate
Domestic ammonium sulfate market prices fluctuated slightly; some high prices dropped a bit. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 66.3% average operating rate, down 0.9% from last week; caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers are operating at about 73% on average, down 3% from last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $94-102/t in Shanxi Province, $103-113/t in Hebei Province, $113-119/t in East China, $97-105/t in Northeast China, and $90-100/t in Southwest China.
On 23 July, Hebei Huafeng tendered ammonium sulfate, selling at $110/t, down $10/t from last week. On the same day, Hebei Qianan Jiujiang held a 960-ton ammonium sulfate tender; the selling price was $110/t, down $13/t from last week. On 24 July, Shanxi Coking auctioned 600 tons of ammonium sulfate on the internet; the starting price was $97/t, but the sale finally failed.
The main seaports’ combined ammonium sulfate inventory is 75,000 tons, up 5,000 tons from last week, with 25,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 5,000 tons in Qingdao Port and 45,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port.
Phosphate & NPK
Production
Typical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 70% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province, and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm maintained its recent low operating rate. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and still maintains an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.
Domestic phosphate
DAP – Domestic DAP markets kept steady overall. With the autumn fertilizer application period approaching, more and more traders and distributors enquired about prices, and prices stayed high; distributors hold a strong wait-and-see attitude.
Central China DAP markets still remained stable overall. Most DAP makers processed existing orders, sending output mainly to North China, East China and Xinjiang AR. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content in Hubei Province stayed at $427-435/t, and the same product delivered to North and East China destinations is $460-468/t; delivered prices for Xinjiang AR destination are $484-500/t. Southwest China’s DAP makers continued to
pay attention to export; they have plenty of export orders to keep them busy till the end of last month. Mainstream FOB prices for DAP with 64% content are $465-470/t.
DAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 451,000 tons (significantly down by 70,000 tons from last week); of that, 120,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 150,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 16,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 70,000 tons in Beihai Port, 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 30,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 15,000 tons in Nantong Port.

MAP – Domestic MAP markets remained stable on the whole. Some of the main NPK companies downstream have plenty of raw material MAP on hand; they are in no rush to purchase, given the current MAP market conditions. Some small NPK producers have not started to buy raw material MAP. New orders are rare; the workload is limited to some existing orders. Most MAP makers manage smooth sales and have no inventory worries.
In Central China, Hubei Province’s Map market prices were almost unchanged; the main MAP producers were fulfilling existing orders, which could last to the end of August. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $355/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $395/t for powder MAP with 60% content.
Southwest China MAP markets remained normal; prices stayed steady. Most of the season’s export orders had been finished. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan Province are $339-347/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $355/t for powder MAP with 60% content.
The main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 100,000 tons, the same as last week, including 30,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 20,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port.
SSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets were stable; some of the main SSP makers in Yunnan and Hubei provinces ran at full load. Mainstream ex-factory prices were $58-66/t for SSP (12%) and $77-81/t for SSP (16%).
Domestic TSP markets were still steady overall. Mainstream FOB prices stayed at $305-330/t. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 107,000 tons, like last week – 50,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 10,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 17,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.
Domestic FMP markets were quiet on the whole; some makers in Yunnan Province remained idle. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $71-77/t for FMP (12%) and $87-94/t for FMP (15%).
International phosphates
The international markets for DAP and MAP are trading slowly. For the West, the USA local market is still having some strength to increase price for DAP barges at $435-438/short ton barge. As such in this line, the USA starts to be attractive for the export cargoes moving to US Gulf. The US export value however is lower to $465/t fob bulk, as it follows the general slow activity of Latin America markets. The MAP 11-52 for Brazil is at $480/t cfr. For Europe there is also a decline of prices. Now the DAP level is said in $515/t cfr North Europe. It keeps North Africa price about $500/t fob Morocco. The Asia business starts to have lower volume activity. For Saudi Arabia DAP, there is no August export DAP conclusion so far for India. China exporters try to hold onto bulk cargo level of $460/t fob.
Raw materials
Sulfur: Domestic sulfur markets stabilized; some traders still
waited to see how the market goes. The main refineries maintained low sulfur inventories; their domestic orders can keep them busy. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $173-189/t in Northeast China, $203-210/t in North China, $194-208/t in East China, $182-194/t in South China and $197-206/t in Southwest China.
Imported sulfur market prices dropped a bit remained high. So the seaport sulfur markets are deadlocked. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 915,000 tons of sulfur on hand, down 43,000 tons from last week, with 320,000 tons in Nantong Port, 60,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 140,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 105,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 40,000 tons in Beihai Port and 220,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.
Sulfur Price and Inventory
Note: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.
Phosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets remained steady overall, with no price adjustments. Some of the main rock producers are maintaining a normal pace of production and shipments. In Guizhou Province, the local phosphate rock markets saw a little improvement on the whole. Slightly more new orders are arriving. FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock makers kept their prices unchanged; mainstream rock prices are stable at $42-45/t for 28% content at Mabian, $35/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock companies slowed their mining activities due to frequent rainfall; rock prices there are $42/t for 28% content. In

after there are new attempts put before US Congress to re-establish the import sanctions block against Belarus MOP imports. For now, the internal US potash pre-season business is slow, as the NOLA indication stays near to
$310/short ton barge. In South America, the price of the Brazil granular MOP imports is still in the mid $320s/t cfr, or up to $340/t cfr for the other nearby Latin import markets.

Story & Analysis
Brief on China’s SOP Industry
Capacity and production
China’s SOP capacity increased from 3.88 million tpy in 2012 to 4.01 million tpy in 2013 and to 6.04 million tpy in 2014; meanwhile, the country’s annual SOP output increased from 2.342 million tons to 2.63 million tons and to 3.992 million tons.
As of 2014, China had 100 SOP makers, of which only nine are natural brine-based, with a combined capacity of 2.72 million tpy (product, same below) for SOP. The combined SOP capacity of the country’s 91 SOP makers that produce SOP based on MOP and other raw materials was 3.32 million tpy.
In 2014, the nine natural brine-based SOP firms produced
2.01million tons of SOP; and these 91 MOP-based SOP makers produced 1.982 million tons of SOP.
As many new SOP plants are being constructed around the country that will be completed this year or next year, the country’s total SOP capacity is projected to reach about 8 million tpy by the end of 2016.
Foreign trade
China’s annual SOP imports fluctuated around 150,000 tons during the past decade. The peak annual SOP import volume was seen in 2006, when China imported 246,700 tons. In 2009, China imported only 90,500 tons. After that, the volume rose continually until 2012, when the country imported more than 165,700 tons. With the increase of
Page 7
domestic SOP output, the volume imported declined to 113,800 tons in 2013 and to 54,800 tons in 2014.
Heilongjiang Province, Inner Mongolia AR, Shandong Province, Yunnan Province and Guangdong Province are China’s main SOP importers.
China exported 52,900 tons of SOP in 2006, 59,700 tons in 2007, and 26,100 tons in 2009. In the period from 2009 to 2013, the country’s SOP exports were very small due to high tariffs on SOP export. Last year, China lowered the tariff to RMB 600/t, so the export volume reached 62,700 tons.
China was a net exporter of SOP last year. Before that, the country had been a net importer for many years.
Consumption
China’s annual consumption of SOP hovered around 2.5
million tons for ten years until 2012. Since then, many new NPK plants have been constructed around the country, demanding more SOP. China’s 2014 apparent consumption of SOP reached 4 million tons.
NPK production is China’s principal use of SOP, consuming an estimated 1.7-1.8 million tons annually.
It is also estimated that about 600,000 tons or 700,000 tons of SOP is directly applied in the country’s agricultural production annually. Around 200,000 tons of SOP is consumed in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces for tobacco production annually. Another 200,000 tons is consumed for tobacco production in the central and northern areas annually. In South China, about 100,000 tons of SOP is used for fruits and vegetables annually. In the Northeast, about 100,000 tons of SOP is used for potatoes annually.
Company Profile: SDIC Xinjiang Luobupo Potash Ltd
SDIC Xinjiang Luobupo Potash completed a 1.2 million tpy SOP plant in November 2008. Before that, the company constructed a 100,000 tpy potash fertilizer unit. Last year, the company launched a 300,000 tpy SOP expansion project. The company is raising its potash fertilizer capacity from the present 1.3 million tpy to 1.6 million tpy by 2017.
The firm produced 1.325 million tons of SOP in 2011, 1.37 million tons in 2012, 1.39 million tons in 2013 and 1.43 million tons in 2014.
Since 2005, the company has produced a total of 7.48 million tons of SOP and sold 7.54 million tons.

New Fertilizer Project in China
1) Urea Project (1000tpy, Product)
Note: some new projects have been completed in 2011, and were delayed to put into production to 2012, such as Guodian Chifeng, Guizhou Jinchi, Jinxin Chemical, Kuitun Jinjiang Chemical and Yangmei Heshun.
We revised the 2011’s table and put these projects into 2012’s table. In addition, 520k tons of urea capacity of Inner Mongolia Tianrun has been delayed to 2013 due to uncertain factors. So the actual new capacity of urea in 2011 putting into production was 3.14m tons.
