UREA
ANALYSIS
Urea rules US market attitude
Average granular urea prices gained a whopping $1/st this week at New Orleans. Midwest and Southern Plains prices were flat.
Far more importantly, distributors also reported substantial sales from retail outlets, especially in the Southern Plains region. That region is where the next wave of US enduser demand for urea will appear, as farmers top-dress emerging winter wheat. The level of demand for urea and some other nitrogen products for this crop already is sparking talk of a reversal in the global urea market. The US has added about 130,000 mt of granular urea spot purchases to arrive by early April in the last couple of weeks. While the volume is a spit in the ocean on the global scale, the trend may force endusers in other countries to return to the market in short order to ensure needed volumes.
MARKETS
UREA
US NOLA: Thin trading, wide price spread
By the end of the week's trading, prompt granular urea barges had changed hands at $187-204/st FOB New Orleans, but with the market trending higher on amost each transaction.
New Orleans values jumped starting February 2 after CF went shopping for prompt barges. The producer paid $198/st FOB New Orleans or more for two-four barges, but stepped away from the market when offers rose to $200/st FOB.
Multiple sales were confirmed as low as $187/st FOB February 1, but most prompt business appears to have occurred around $195-200/st FOB.
Bids for 2H February started the week at $194/st FOB, but forward business has been booked up to $208/st FOB.
Import lineup
Meanwhile, a 40-45,000 mt cargo of granular urea and a 30-35,000 mt cargo of granular urea have been booked for March arrival in the US. The urea was bought at $195-200/mt FOB Middle East. The smaller of the two cargos is believed to belong to Keytrade, and will arrive in early March, thanks to taking the short route through the Suez canal. The larger cargo has been linked to just about every importer to the US market, but confirmation of ownership could not be secured at press time.
Previously Koch was confirmed as owning a spot Chinese panamax due into New Orleans at the end of March, while Dreymoor will bring a PIC 40,000 mt contract cargo to the US Gulf next month.
US S. Plains: Sales may support higher prices
Some distributors along the Arkansas River who have sold most of their granular urea at $240/st FOB in recent days, believe demand is sufficient to move back up to $245/st FOB.
Many sellers in the region report a steady stream of retail demand, almost all of which appears to have been sold to meet prior sales to farmers. This means a great deal of retailer space remains to be filled before the top-dress run on winter wheat gets underway in force.
US Midwest: Prices hold for remaining urea
Granular urea bins at the distributor and retail level across the Midwest are exhausted in many
cases. Increasingly quotes to retailers are not based on prompt pick up, but on when warehouses can be restocked by barge when the upper Mississippi River system reopens for the spring.
This situation is why prompt offers for the remaining granular urea as far north as the Twin Cities in Minnesota are holding at $260/st FOB, while river-open prices for the same point are closer to $250/st FOB. The lowest prompt price tag in the Midwest region remains $235/st FOB around St. Louis, Missouri, which still is accessible by barge.
Canada: Coop Federee purchase suggested
Canadian importer Coop Federee is reported to have booked a cargo of 20-25,000 mt granular urea with a trader supplying from the Baltic in February or early March at $212/mt CFR basis one-port discharge.
Evidently convinced that the market for granular urea may have reached a floor, the importer is suggested to be seeking an additional cargo for March loading.
Mexico: Group testing prices February 4
The Mexican Group of Importers is evaluating offers for 25,000 mt prilled or granular urea February 4. The enquiry called for offers to be submitted for the quantity to load in February/early March for discharge at three East Coast Mexico ports.
Other importers are also contemplating purchases, and will be following the Group tender closely for price guidance.
Mexican imports of urea from January through November were meanwhile assessed by customs at 1.43 million mt, down by 0.5% on the same period in 2014.
Imports from China were down by 5.9% to 756,000 mt and Russia was off by 1.2% to 484,000 mt. Arrivals from the UAE were up from zero to 52,000 mt while Ukraine was down by 52% to 43,400 mt.
November imports were off sharply from 149,000 in 2014 to 19,000 mt in 2015. Russia accounted for 18,200 mt of the November 2015 volume while arrivals from China were down from 127,000 mt in 2014 to 140 mt in 2015.

UAN
US Atlantic Coast: Import competition drives UAN lower
UAN truck prices along the US East Coast have fallen as low as $5.31/unit FOB in the Chesapeake region. Prices are still posted up to $5.94/unit FOB from terminals further south.
The driver for the current decline appears to be the willingness of sellers of UAN from EuroChem, Acron and possibly other suppliers to compete hard for business in order to clear tank space for further imports. Postings along the Atlantic seaboard were over $6.72/unit FOB in prior weeks.
Import market
As a result of this competition, indications for spot UAN Cargos to the US East Coast have declined $5/mt from the prior week to $170-175/mt CFR. Some importers argue they can buy below this level but no completed business has been confimed in the $160s/mt CFR so far.
US NOLA: UAN quotes holding firm
More and more traders are confirming that despite lower bids and offers in the paper markets, prompt UAN- 32 barges are not available below $160/st FOB New Orleans.
Much of the more bearish talk in the marketplace has been fueled by the rumor that CF is supporting a cargo sale through a trader to Argentina that would net no better than $130-140/mt FOB US Gulf. However, domestic physical offers and barge offers from UAN importers have not reached near these levels.
US Midwest: Modest shift in UAN quotes
US UAN indications arguably are up marginally this week. However, the difference from earlier reports is very modest and reflects higher costs from some inland terminals rather than improved enduser support. The current Midwest price spread is $6.94-7.00/unit FOB.
AS
US S. Plains: AS values hold after prior plunge
After the sharp decline in ammonium sulphate postings in the south at the end of January, distributors have held steady at $220-230/st FOB in the last couple of weeks. Seasonal demand will not emerge for another few weeks, and peak AS use in the south usually coincides with the first urea application on the rice crop, when the two products are blended.
Mexico: Jump in AS imports from Belgium
Mexican AS imports for November 2015 were just 23 mt, a decrease of 100% on the same period in 2014.
Total imports for the January-November 2015 period registered 213,982 mt, down 20% year-on-year. Mexican imports from Belgium for the first 11 months of this year grew significantly reaching 144,069 mt, up on the mere 17,000 mt recorded for 2014.
Off-take from Belarus was 16,886 mt, up 62%. Due to Mexican sanctions on AS originating from China and US, imports from these countries have slumped. Off-take from China reached just 6,500 mt for January- November 2015, a 96% decline on the prior year, while imports from the US were just 416 mt, down 99% year-on-year.
AMMONIA
MARKETS
AMMONIA
US Midwest: Some suppliers offer cheaper ammonia
Not all suppliers are matching up, but prompt ammonia offers are more aggressive from some US producers and traders this week. Midwest retailers are finding offers from river and pipeline terminals at $430/st FOB this week, down $20/st from prior indications.
There are rumors of sales at even lower levels, based on trucked ammonia from plants farther afield, but there also are postings remaining at $450/st FOB from some sellers.
US NOLA: Barge indications narrow
Inland ammonia resale values dropped this week, which cut into the potential return available for ammonia barges in the US Gulf and leaving the current week's range at $301-330/st FOB New Orleans.
The decline in the average price was only $10/st over the last week. However, that drop was the result of $20/st being subtracted entirely from the top end of last week's range of $301-350/st FOB.
US Tampa: Mosaic cut hits demand
A rough estimate of lost US Gulf ammonia demand during Q1 is 73,000 mt, assuming Mosaic cuts finished phosphate production by the maximum indicated figure of 400,000 mt. However, the likely figure is more difficult to estimate compared to prior years as the company has not provided more details of the likely reduction betweek DAP, MAP and its MicroEssentials line. All tnese products consume various amounts of nitrogen and the company does not provide precise details on its MicroEssentials output.
US S. Plains: More aggressive offers
Producers are backing lower prices for ammonia to ship on a prompt and forward basis in Oklahoma, Texas, southern Kansas and elsewhere. Prices have declined an average of $22/st from late January to $315-330/st FOB, according to distributors in the region.
Orders for ammonia are coming in based on these offers, with deliveries likely to be spread from coming weeks into March for use as pre-plant applications on corn acres.
US Northern Plains: Ammonia slightly lower
There no consistent reports out of the Dakotas regarding ammonia values, with some suppliers suggesting price cuts in the region are not as aggressive as seen in other regions. Sellers would only admit to about a $10/st decline from prior weeks to $490/st FOB. However, there remains time for buyers to push for cuts that more closely reflect ammonia costs seen in other US markets.
PHOSPHATES
ANALYSIS
Mosaic cuts output, DAP still losing ground
Mosaic announced its long expected production curtailment this week, saying it would cut up to 400,000 mt of finished phosphate production during Q1. However, it would be a substantial exaggeration to suggest the market has reacted to this move.
The US New Orleans DAP benchmark inched slightly higher this week, but most inland postings moved down in key regions. This indicates that the domestic DAP/MAP supply chain remains well stocked and that
distributors and retailers are more concerned with disposing of existing supplies and spring orders than in adding more volume.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
US NOLA: DAP steady after Mosaic confirms cut
At the start of the week the bid offer spread for prompt DAP barges was reported at $310-315/st FOB New Orleans. By February 4 completed business was reported at $313-326/st FOB New Orleans by traders, as bullish buying overtook bearish sentiments expressed by many traders. In addition, Mosaic claimed a single DAP barge sale at $335/st FOB, creating a $22/st spread for the week.
On average, this week's DAP New Orleans price range is $1.50/st higher than the prior week.
Meanwhile, two more PhosAgro 30-35,000 mt cargos are planned for the US, both believed destined for United Suppliers. EuroChem also is in the freight market to load 50,000 mt of MAP for the US. These vessels are expected to arrive by the end of March.
US Tampa: No new exports again
Mosaic is not reporting any new export sales over the past week. Its February 3 announcement of a Q1 production cut indicated it would not participate in recent low indications cited in Brazil's market. Even earlier returns possible from Brazil and other markets in South America suggest a decline in the US export indication to $350-360/mt FOB Tampa.
This week's drop indicates a decline of $20/mt from the prior week at both ends of the range. The move down puts the export price tag roughly in line with bids for March physical positions in the New Orleans barge market.
US S. Plains: DAP quotes lower due to lack of interest
DAP is not moving from warehouses in the southern US east or west of the Mississippi River yet, but distributors have been tempted to lower posted prices in hopes of attracting demand. At press time, quotes for DAP from warehouses along the Arkansas River were at $355/st, while inland locations south of Mason- Dixon typically were $360/st FOB. The low end of this range is $15/st below last week's postings.
US Midwest: Modest demand yields lower prices
Modest phosphate sales volumes are typical in winter, but Midwest distributors have been willing to reflect lower replacement costs for DAP and MAP in recent weeks by cutting resale prices to retailers.
Over the last week, sales prices have slipped about $10/st to as low as $360/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River.
USA: Mosaic finally announces phosphate cuts
Mosaic finally came through with its expected market related production cut announcement February 3. It said it intends to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns.
Mosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market.
Some traders were disappointed that the company hedged its plans by not committing to the full 400,000 mt of cuts, and instead said only that it would reduce by up to that volume.
Nevertheless, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best time for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system and up to 60 days before field work for most spring planting will be underway. While some further cargos from Morocco and possibly the FSU are expected to arrive in coming weeks, traders probably will not be able to add spot cargos from China to the US import lineup.
Mexico: DAP/MAP/TSP exports drop 19% in 2015
Mexico exported 620,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP between January and November against 762,000 mt in the same period in 2014, representing a 19% reduction, according to GTIS.
MAP exports reached 263,000 mt during the period with 105,000 mt to Australia, 76,000 mt to Chile and 58,000 mt to Argentina. DAP exports reached 138,000 mt during the period with 41,000 mt to Argentina, 36,000 mt to Chile, 20,000 mt to Australia and 26,000 mt to Cuba and Ecuador combined.
TSP exports reached 219,000 mt including 93,000 mt to Chile, 90,000 mt to Argentina, 17,000 mt to the US and 16,000 mt to Brazil.
In December, Fertinal is believed to have exported 70,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP, bringing its full year DAP/MAP/TSP exports to almost 700,000 mt, which would be a fall of 13% against the full year 2014.
Mexico: DAP/MAP prices fall in new deal
Fertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The shipment is priced on a formula.
The company continues to negotiate one 40,000 mt mixed DAP/MAP/TSP cargo to Chile which is likely to load in early March.
Fertinal's current DAP/MAP price levels are quoted at 370/mt FOB as the company benefits from higher prices in the Australian buying season and as it avoids sales to the low priced Brazilian market.
POTASH
MARKETS
MOP
US NOLA: Barge offers drift lower
Imported potash barges continue to inch lower as some importers continue to accept lower bids in order to reduce their positions ahead of the expected reopening of the upper Mississippi River system in mid-late March. The bottom of this week's range was cited at $205/st FOB, although some suppliers are holding out for at least $210/st FOB.
US Midwest: Some truck sales at latest postings
New granular potash sales from distributors to retailers are sparse, but reports from the Midwest suggest the $260/st FOB price tag sought by some Canadian suppliers has been accepted in the market. So far only about a $5/st discount is indicated for some, but not all, offshore material.
Mexico: November MOP imports down 72%
Mexico imported 9,283 mt of MOP in November, a decrease of 72% from the same month in 2014, according to the latest customs data via GTIS.
Of this, 6,307 mt was shipped by SQM. This can be compared to November 2014, when the Chilean producer sent 12,756 mt to Mexico. Uralkali and Canpotex each loaded around 1,000 mt in November 2015.
The month’s MOP imports brought Mexico’s January through November total to 243,068 mt – 17% more than in the same period of 2014, despite the decreased November shipments.
SQM remained the country’s largest supply partner, having shipped 94,904 during the 11 months of 2015, compared to 70,907 mt the year before. Mexico imported 74,677 mt from Canpotex and 64,895 mt from Uralkali, respective increases of 27% and 10% from 2014.
SULPHUR
MARKETS
SULPHUR
US Gulf: Mosaic believed to have reduced Q1 supply
Mosaic is believed to have negotiated lower liquid sulphur volumes for delivery to its US Gulf phosphate operations during Q1, but it is unclear if it has turned away all of the sulphur to cover its announced
phosphate production curtailment. This is because Mosaic said it would cut up to 400,000 mt of finished products, rather than providing a specific figure.
Correction: Last week's edition of Fertilizer Week should have posted a US Tampa contract liquid sulphur price tag of $95/lt FOB. The February 28 edition did not correctly update settled Q1 business, and instead posted $110/lt FOB. FW regrets any confusion that ensued.
SULPHURIC ACID
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
Mexico: November exports reach 131,421 mt
Mexico exported 131,421 mt of sulphuric acid in November 2015, up 65% year on year. This brought exports for the first 11 months of the year to 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014.
The US remained the main destination for Mexican exports, taking 70,970 mt of the November volumes, most if not all of which was likely sourced from Grupo Mexico’s La Caridad smelter.
Mexico also sent 38,280 mt to Brazil and 21,780 mt to Morocco in November, having sent sulphuric acid to Morocco for the first time on record in September.
For January to November 2015, exports to Chile climbed to 225,054 mt from 39,286 mt in the equivalent period in 2014 and 45,066 mt in 2013, while exports to Brazil were up to 178,966 mt from effectively nothing in 2014 and 2013.
The increases are the result of production at the Boleo mine, which began producing copper January 17, 2015 and has been a key source of marginal acid supply.
CRU estimates that Boleo’s maximum consumption of sulphuric acid in 2015 was around 60-100,000 mt, while it is able to produce around 700,000 mt.
In recent months, length in the Chilean market forced Mexico to divert cargoes from Chile to Brazil and Morocco at exceptionally low or even negative FOB prices.
Conversely, Mexican imports for the year to November were down 2% at 168,856 mt, with 99,956 mt from South Korea, 46,086 mt from China, 18,755 mt from Japan, and 4,030 from the US. Imports from China are up from effectively nothing in previous years.
US: Spot market quiet on limited demand
The US spot market remained quiet, though sources suggested that contractual volumes continued moving. Some argued that the domestic market was long, limiting import demand. Meanwhile, spot prices were assessed stable in the $40s/mt CFR pending further indications.
