Market Summary
Prices bottom out and may rally short-term
After a three-month decrease that has seen about $60/t wiped off most fob levels, urea prices finally bottomed out this week. Traders started to cover short sales and some have taken long positions at the same time for February shipment.
Conditions are very similar to those in October-November 2015, when prices rallied for 2-3 weeks, jumping $20/t in the process, and few expect this to be more than a temporary period of firmer prices. It may persist for longer, though, because it is coinciding with peak spring season demand in several countries.
Buyers, who have delayed their inquiries due to falling prices, are expected to purchase now, leading to a rush of demand in Latin America and elsewhere. Bids at $190/t cfr in Mexico and Turkey, which would have been entertained last week, will no longer find any takers.
Short covering in the Black Sea has seen prices pushed back up to $200-201/t fob Yuzhny from the low-$190s/t fob at the start of the week. Little urea remains unsold for February now.

Baltic urea traded up from $182/t fob to $188-192/t fob for February, while two Middle East cargoes were sold at $200/t fob.
Chinese suppliers have not been in a mood to reduce prices further prior to the New Year break and one trader who needed 6,000t of prilled urea for February loading could find no sellers below $200/t fob. This contrasts with the short sales made early in the week in Asia at prices netting to $185-187/t fob for February.
The US market is lending strength to urea. CF was reportedly out buying in barges of granular urea this week. Cfr levels in the US Gulf have firmed to $220-223/t, equivalent to $210- 213/t fob Middle East given current depressed freight rates.
While it is becoming late to load new cargoes for the US, traders are trying to work first half February loaders and the US provides a welcome alternative to Brazil for AG cargoes at present. There are few cargoes being offered to Brazilian buyers at present and prices these have moved up to $200- 205/t cfr.
The only origin to see lower prices this week was Egypt, where sales were made at $215 and $218/t fob for February. Competition in European markets, which are slow for Febru- ary, from the Arabian Gulf is keeping a lid on prices there.

Urea
Black Sea
Traders have grabbed most of the available tonnage of urea left for February this week, paying prices between $192 and $201/t fob. The purchases are partly to cover short sales in Turkey and other Black Sea markets and also as long posi- tions in anticipation of renewed buying now that the market has found a temporary floor.
Only some 10-20,000t of prilled urea remain unsold for Feb- ruary and prices have been bid above $200/t fob for small parcels.
Reports continue to emanate from Turkey that offers are at $195/t cfr, but there is no indication that spot tonnage from Yuzhny or Tuapse has sold at equivalent fob levels.
Baltic
Producers have sold several parcels of prilled urea for Febru- ary shipment at $182-192/t fob over the past week to traders covering short positions and going long. This has put them in a more comfortable position for February.
SBU sold 25,000t of prilled urea to a trader at close to
$190/t fob for mid-February loading and a further 15,000t is reported under negotiation in the high-$180s/t fob. Traders have bought 5,000t parcels of prilled urea at $192/t fob.
Phosagro sold 25,000t of prills to a trader early in the week at $182/t fob. It has 30,000t of prilled urea committed to

Trammo and will load a urea/DAP/NPK combination cargo for Africa in February. Its next full cargo of urea is available for early-March loading.
Uralchem has yet to sell all its February tonnage, but is in discussions and is expected to compete for the Mexican buy- ing pool tender. Its price ideas are above $190/t fob.
Ammoni is planning to ship around 25,000t of granular urea from Riga and over 25,000t from Ust-Luga in February. It sold 25,000t last week at $210-215/t fob Riga to two traders on a spot basis. Nitron has bought around 12,000t of Men- deleyevsk granular at a reported price in the low-$190s/t fob for February shipment to Canada.
Grodno held a sales tender on 1 February for 15,000t of granular urea for February shipment. It is reported to have sold some of the urea in regional markets and has issued a new tender for 20,000t of granular urea for February ship- ment, closing on 5 February.
A trader will load 11,000t of granular urea in Riga 9-10 Feb- ruary for Antwerp.
Europe
Turkey
Demand has slowed now that traders are less willing to short the market aggressively. Gemlik inquired for 25,000t early in the week but had a target of $190/t cfr, which was not attainable. Gubretas held an online tender on 3 February for 10,000t of prilled urea for February shipment, asking for offers to be valid to 6 February. A decision was pending at presstime.
There is still talk of prices as low as $185-190/t cfr but this refers to sales made 2-3 weeks ago when traders were selling short.

Middle East Export Sales
France
Offer prices have dropped to €220-224/t fca this week, helped by the stronger euro, which moved back up to $1.11-
1.12on Thursday. Demand is largely covered for February, with urea still in store in major ports to meet it, and new buying is for March-April arrival.
A 25,000t Kuwaiti granular urea cargo has been booked for second half February loading that is expected to move to France. Freight is estimated at $17-18/t Shuaiba-French Bay.
Spain
There is some interest in granular urea imports but caution over falling prices and loading delays is hampering actual trade. Granular urea is on offer at $252/t cif including 90 days’ credit for immediate loading or at prices below $250/t cif including 90 days’ credit, with laycan/arrivals not fully fixed. Importers are aware that anything arriving in March may be too late for the current cereals application period.
Among recent imports, Medifer is understood to have 4,000t of Algerian urea arriving in Alicante.

In the domestic market, Fertiberia is priced at around
€240-245/t fca but will be competitive amid falling granular prices. NIC is offering granular urea at €260/t fca.
Germany
Granular urea prices remain soft and have dropped to €230- 235/t fca, compared with €240-250/t fca two weeks ago. Some small lots are reported to have been concluded within this range for February-March delivery basis open origin, but most buyers have been deterred by falling prices.
Forwards sales of granular urea are also being offered for June 2016-January 2017 delivery at the suppliers' option at prices around €220-225/t fca. But there is little uptake of this offer as buyers remain cautious amid a weak sentiment in the international market.
Prilled urea is on offer at €219-223/t fca Baltic sea ports. Again, there is very little interest on the buy side. Trammo is in the freight market to load around 6,000t of urea in Ust Luga on 6-8 February for shipment to Lubeck.
Issue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016
Middle East
Two cargoes of granular urea have been sold at $200/t fob for February loading, marking a step up in prices for non-US markets. At the low end of the range, the latest sale in Thai- land nets back to $188/t fob Middle East.
PIC, Fertil and SIUCI are sold out for February. Depending on contract liftings, Sabic and Muntajat could have cargoes to sell for late-February. Traders are seeking spot tonnage to load for the US, where prices have moved up to the equiva- lent of $220/t cfr this week.
Kuwait
PIC has sold 25,000t of Kuwaiti granular urea to a trader at a price in the low-$200s/t fob for second half February ship- ment to West Europe.
Dreymoor has fixed a vessel at about $14/t to load 44,000t of granular urea prompt in Shuaiba for two ports, US west coast. It will also load 40-44,000t in Kuwait in late-February/ early-March for Dreymoor for the US Gulf.

Nitron is loading 19,000t of granular urea from SIUCI on a 60,000t vessel for Argentina in combination with 41,000t of phosphates from Saudi Arabia. One of the offtakers has agreed a price of $200/t fob with SIUCI for a February cargo, expected to be shipped to the US.
The plant at Sohar is reported to be down for 1-2 weeks, meaning that the next spot cargo is only available in March. SIUCI has also been offered a spot cargo for early-March loading, indicating bids at $200/t fob for it.
Saudi Arabia
Sabic is reported to have an agreement to supply 100,000t of urea to Sudan over the coming months under a Saudi loan agreement.
Africa
Egypt
Production has been interrupted at Egyptian plants since late January.
A pipeline explosion in Damietta cut gas supply to the Mopco
and ENPC urea plants on 24 January and they are expected to be down until around 20 February.
Alexfert and Helwan shutdown on 29 January due to gas supply issues but were down for only 4-5 days and have now restarted. EFC is running at 70pc capacity and says it is directing 40pc of its output to the local market. Helwan has 35,000t of granular urea to sell for February shipment.
Sales have taken place this week in a range of $215-224/t fob for February shipment, down $8-9/t at the low end on last week’s sales. The sales are being kept confidential, but it is understood that 20,000t were sold at a price netting to $215/t fob to two traders. Trammo purchased 10,000t at $224/t fob, while Keytrade bought 4-5,000t at $218/t fob.
South Africa
Urea imports totalled 663,000t in 2015 according to data from GTIS/SARS, down from 905,000t in 2014. The 2014 import figure was exceptionally high and 2015 imports represent a return to more normal import levels. Three Middle East producers accounted for about 84pc of the total: Qatar sold 231,000t; Saudi Arabia 184,000t; and Abu Dhabi 141,000t. Chinese shipments dropped from 236,000t in 2014 to 25,000t last year.

Asia
China
The urea market has been quiet ahead of the New Year holiday that starts on 8 February. But suppliers have moved asking prices up this week, with the result that at least one lot of prilled urea sold at $200/t fob to a trader who needed to cover for February loading. Asking prices for granular urea also moved up to the high-$190s/t fob.
At the same time, traders have continued to sell short at prices reflecting $185/t fob for February shipment from China. The market will be slow for the next two weeks and some fall in production is likely during February due to the holiday.
Deliveries to ports have slowed over the past two weeks and inventories are estimated at around 1m tonnes. It is impossible to be optimistic about price developments with the background of over-production and high inventories and there may be renewed pressure on prices from late-Febru- ary.
India
Three urea cargoes bought under the last MMTC and IPL ten- ders have been rejected and refused permission to discharge by the Indian government.
PIC’s 36,750t vessel m/v Jewel of Sohar sailed four days after the 5 January deadline and has been waiting at Kandla since 15 January. It has not been cleared by DOF for dis- charge. Dreymoor has a 68,000t vessel sold to IPL waiting at Gangavaram due to an issue about particle size. Valency’s 66,000t vessel m/v Long Dar has been waiting to discharge at Gangavaram since 14 December for MMTC.
Thailand
Liven has sold 20,000t of granular urea for February ship- ment at $196/t cfr. It is expected to load the urea in the Arabian Gulf.
Sri Lanka
Haleys has bought 8,000t of prilled urea for February ship- ment from China at $210/t cfr, netting to the mid-$180s/t fob China. Valency is reported to be the supplier.
South Korea
Dongbu closed a tender on 3 February for 6,000t of granular urea for shipment by 4 March. It bought the cargo at a price equivalent to $187/t fob China.
Pungnong purchased 5,000t of granular urea from Dreymoor at $197/t cfr under its 28 January tender for first half Febru- ary shipment.
KG Chemical bought 5,000t of granular urea from Dreymoor at $197/t cfr under its 29 January tender for February ship- ment.
Malaysia
Nafas awarded its 27 January tender for 6,000t of prilled urea for February shipment at $201/t cfr. Golden Barley is reported to be the seller.
Vietnam
Demand for 5-6,000t cargoes of granular urea has emerged for February shipment, with 1-2 Fudao cargoes sold and trad- ers also selling against supply from southeast Asia at prices close to $210/t cfr.
Americas
US
Prices have firmed this week, rising from initial levels around $190/st fob Nola to $208/st at presstime. The rally in midweek was helped by reports of CF buying in barges of granular urea. The reason was not specified, but prompted speculation about plant outages.
Market sentiment continued to improve through the week, with prompt/February barges trading up to $206-208/st fob and March barges trading at least six times at $210/st fob Nola.
Some distributors are happy to sell into the run up, not convinced the market will remain firm, reasoning that cur- rent prices, equivalent to $220-223/t cfr, will pull in spot tonnage. The lack of farmer demand also continues to fuel caution ahead of next week’s TFI meeting.
Canada
Sylvite has bought 12,000t of granular urea from Nitron for February shipment from Ust Luga, Russia.
Mexico
Buyers have come into the market for urea this week, inquiries for around 60,000t of prilled urea circulating for February loading for the east coast.

Argus FMB Nitrogen
A buying group comprising Yara, Isaosa, Tepeyac and Gavilon, held a tender on 4 February for 25,000t for Febru- ary shipment to three ports on the east coast. Several other importers, including Pronamex, Agrogen, ADM and Fertiquim are checking prices for 10-15,000t lots of prilled urea for the east coast.
Indications from buyers have been low at around $190/t cfr, but firmer Baltic urea prices this week is likely to mean of- fers are above $200/t cfr.
Tepeyac is expected in the market to buy 25,000t of granu- lar urea for the west coast shortly.
Central America
The Mexican tender is seen as a test as to whether buyers will accept current suppliers’ price ideas for urea, which are above $200/t cfr. If they do, then several other inquiries from Central America could firm up. Requirements in the region include:
NPK Trading 25,000t for Guatemala, Costa Rica and
Colombia
Incofe 20-25,000t of prilled and 20-25,000t of granular urea for ECCA and WCCA respectively
Fertica Honduras 20-25,000t of prilled urea for Pto Cortes
Brazil
Urea prices have firmed this week and a trader has bought a substantial quantity of granular urea at $200/t cfr Santos covering existing sales and to free up urea on an incoming vessel. This marks the end of a near continuous fall in prices over the past 2-3 months.
Low prices have cut the number of cargoes being loaded for Brazil in the Arabian Gulf, with currently only two traders – Ameropa and Koch - offering and quoting $205-210/t cfr.
Fertipar is in the market for 15,000t of granular urea and Heringer 10,000t for February shipment.
Last week’s sale at $190/t cfr to Fertipar has been linked to Trammo and is said to involve options for delivery up to June.

Ammonium Sulphate/Nitrate
Russia
Prices for AN for export have dropped to around $175/t fob for February. Russian producers are selling as much of their AN as possible to the local market, where prices are equiva- lent to $180-185/t fob even with the lower rouble exchange rate. But exports are facing pressure from urea.
There is minimal interest in importing AN in Brazil at pres- ent, while Turkish buyers are indicating prices need to fall to $140-150/t cfr to become competitive again with urea.
Small sales of steel grade amsul are taking place. NLMK sold 2,500t for February shipment to Klaipeda at $114/t cpt Draugiste. Altai-Koks will ship its February tonnage to the domestic market.
MMK sold 500t at €70/t ex-works for shipment to Lithuania. Mechel held a sales tender on 4 February for 1,500t for Feb- ruary shipment from its plant.
Capro grade prices remain very high in the Black Sea relative to levels elsewhere, but the small size of shipments and lim- ited supply in the region means there is little competition.
Northwest Europe
The market remains at a standstill, distributors and farmers unwilling to buy more CAN/AN until existing stocks are used up. CAN 27 prices remain nominally €225-230/t cif inland.
OCI will restart the first line on its CAN plant in the coming week and hopes to restore full production by March. It will not begin to offer CAN again until the progress of the restart is clear. No significant volumes are expected until end- March/April at the earliest.
China
The business has closed for the New Year holiday, with prices unchanged at $104-110/t fob for capro grade amsul.
UAN Solutions
Argentina
Bunge purchased 25,000t of UAN 32 from Nitron ex-US under its tender last week at $171/t cfr for four port discharge. Ni- tron will load UAN from CF Industries’ Donaldsonville plant. Freight is put at $45-46/t.
Canada
CFQ has bought 12,000t of UAN 32 for March shipment to Hamilton. Helm ex-Trinidad is reported to be the supplier. The price has not been revealed, but is estimated to be around $190/t cfr based on competing offers from the Baltic.
China
Agronova has fixed a vessel to load 27,000t of UAN 32 in China in February for shipment to Portland, Oregon, bought at $145-150/t fob. Freight is reported at $36/t.
France
UAN 30 prices have dropped over the past week, with sales made at €155-157/t fca Rouen for February-April delivery. The price has fallen to the level implied by the most recent sale in Egypt - $140/t fob even though only 5,000t were sold from there and not for France.
Eurochem will load 35-40,000t of UAN 32 in Novorossisk in February for Rouen/Ghent. It is checking freight, with rate indications in the high-$10s/t for Black Sea-France, and has also fixed 15,000t to load in Klaipeda for Rouen at $19/t.
Offers for the summer months have dropped below €150/t fca for the first time, with suppliers now at €145-147/t fca for July-October delivery at their option.
Baltic
Agronova has fixed several vessels for February loading in Sillamae, including 10,000t to La Pallice at $26-27/t; 18,000t to Rouen at $21/t; 10,000t to Ghent at $20/t; and 33-35,000t for the US east coast at $35-36/t.
Kenya
Eurochem is in the freight market for a vessel to load 30,000t of CAN in Antwerp or Nikolayev for Mombasa in the second half of February.
Finland
Traders are checking freight for 6,500t of amsul to load in Pori 8-10 February for Samsun, Turkey.
US
Apart from the west coast, activity in the UAN market has remained slow this week and lacking in price discovery. Ac- tivity died down after CF’s offer last week, which was valid for two days, was withdrawn and buyers have backed away waiting for some demand from farmers.
Nola prices are still pegged at $150-155/st fob. CF has sold 25,000t of UAN 32 for export to Argentina via Nitron. The cfr
Licensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP
price is $171/t and freight is estimated in the mid-$40s/t, in- dicating an fob level in the mid-$120s/t from Donaldsonville.
Russian UAN for March arrival is on offer at $165/t cfr on the east coast, down by $5/t from last week. Buyers believe it is biddable lower. Lack of empty storage space is limiting buying.
On the west coast, Agronova is shipping 27,000t of Chinese UAN to IRM in Portland, Oregon. The price is reported to be in the high-$180s/t cfr.
Egypt
Abu Qir will hold a sales tender on 8 February for 25,000t of UAN 32 for 11-15 February loading.

Yara takes a charge against Q4 earnings
Yara will take an asset impairment charge of about 1.15bn kroner ($133m) in its fourth-quarter 2015 results, which will be released on 11 February. Around NOK 930m of the total relates to the Yara plants at Montoir, France, and at Point Lisas, Trinidad.
Yara Montoir will take an impairment charge of about NOK 550m. The plant is one of Yara's smallest fertilizer facilities, with production capacity of around 300,000t/yr of nitrates and 300,000t/yr of NPKs. The plant has limited export opportunities and is exposed to lower profitability in its do- mestic market, given lower grain prices and lower phosphate and potash demand.
The impairment charge for Yara Trinidad is about NOK 380m. The Trinidad plant is one of Yara's smallest ammonia plants, with production capacity of around 270,000t/yr. The plant suffers from frequent gas supply curtailments and also has lower energy efficiency than Yara's average levels.
Yara's fourth-quarter results will also be affected by lower sales and production volumes compared with the year-earlier period, mainly for ammonia and urea following significant production shutdowns at plants producing those products during the quarter. Deliveries of Yara's own-produced am- monia and urea each fell by about 160,000t compared with a year earlier, while sales of own-produced nitrates were down by around 100,000t. Compound NPK deliveries were in line with a year earlier.
Yara's fourth-quarter 2015 operating income is expected to be about NOK 700m, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are expected to be around NOK 3.5bn.
CF/CHS supply agreement takes effect
CF Industries kicked off its long-term supply agreement with CHS on 1 February by delivering its first loads of urea and UAN to the farmer-owned cooperative.
The $2.8bn supply agreement allows CHS to purchase up to 1.1m st/yr of granular urea and 580,000 st/yr of UAN from CF. The agreement, which was signed in August, also gives CHS a minority equity interest in CF Industries Nitrogen, a CF subsidiary.
The 1.7m st of total product available to CHS through the
Licensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP
supply agreement represents roughly 9pc of CF's total pro- duction capacity after the completion of capacity expansion projects at its Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, facilities. Expansions at both facilities are anticipated to be complete by the third quarter and will expand CF's total production capacity to 19m st/yr.
"This is an important day for CHS member-owners as we not only complete the single largest investment in our history, but more importantly establish a long-term dependable nitrogen fertilizer supply, supply chain efficiency and oppor- tunity for economic value," CHS chief executive Carl Casale said.
The supply agreement allowed CHS to scrap plans for a $3bn nitrogen fertilizer plant in Spiritwood, North Dakota.
Mosaic curtails phosphate production
The US’ largest phosphate producer, Mosaic, will cut phos- phate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016, it said today on 3 February.
If fully realized, the cuts will represent 14pc of Mosaic's quarterly finished phosphate production capacity. Mosaic produced 2.4mn t of finished phosphates in the third quarter of 2015, representing 83pc of its operational capacity. The company releases fourth quarter and full-year figures on 11 February.
"The long-term positive outlook for phosphates has not changed, but we are adjusting our production levels to match immediate demand and manage our margins," Mosaic chief executive Joc O'Rourke said.
The company said the curtailment is in response to cur- rent crop nutrient market conditions. Prices for US DAP have been in decline since trading at $420/st fob Nola in late October because of lagging domestic and international demand. By late January, DAP prices hovered around $310/ st fob Nola — a 26pc drop and the lowest level since 2009. Since then the market has improved marginally, with trades last week at $315-$320/st fob Nola.
US DAP export prices have also dropped steadily since September 2015, going from the mid-$450s/t fob Tampa to $380-$385/t fob as of last week because of decreasing global demand, particular in Brazil and Latin America.
Mosaic's phosphate feedstock costs have dropped sharply as
well. The February Tampa ammonia contract fell by $40/t from January to a six-year low of $310/t cfr. The first quarter molten sulphur contract settled down $15/lt to $95/lt deliv- ered to its lowest point since the fourth quarter of 2013. The prospect of lowered US farm incomes and an unfavor- able outlook for crop prices have many farmers deferring fertilizer orders until the last minute. However, Mosaic believes prices are at a level that will inspire a rebound in demand.
"With the recent price volatility and decline in raw mate- rial costs, buyers appear to be delaying purchases. This is lengthening the seasonal period of weak demand," Mosaic senior vice president of commercial operations Rick McLel- lan said. "Today's crop nutrient prices, including phosphates, are attractive to farmers globally and we expect a strong demand response after this seasonally slow period."
Uralchem production up 4pc in 2015
Russian producer Uralchem raised its output of all fertilizers by about 4pc in 2015 to 5.9m tonnes. Ammonia output grew 4pc to 2.978m tonnes in 2015, while the production of its main product line, ammonium nitrate was marginally down on 2014 at 2.928m tonnes.
Urea production rose 7pc to 1.186m tonnes, making Ural- chem the second largest Russian producer. Merchant am- monia output increased by 6pc to 825,000t, while compound fertilizer production rose 18pc to 617,000t.
