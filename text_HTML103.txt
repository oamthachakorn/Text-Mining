MARKET ANALYSIS
US urea market still at center of attention
By Lars Taarland
The US New Orleans benchmark continues to provide marginally better returns to Middle East suppliers than many other global markets, despite a substantial plunge to an average of $277/st FOB New Orleans this week versus $289/st FOB last week.
The decline was blamed in part on delays in demand from the key US urea market of the Southern Plains due to wet weather. However, inland prices in that region and elsewhere would support substantially higher barge values at this stage. This suggests pressure from other market forces or doubts about market direction among at least a few players.
April barge positions trading into the $260s/st FOB imply delivered values below $290/mt CFR, suggesting netbacks to producers below $265/mt FOB Middle East to provide an intermediary with a small margin.
Netbacks to regional producers did also slide further on lower regional prices, and theoretical netbacks from Europe were also lower despite a gain in the value of the euro that did provide some initial benefit to US dollar-based suppliers.
European buyers were however quick to point out that lower international prices should be reflected in delivered values, and argued that CIF numbers should be adjusted accordingly.
Fierce competition on sales from prior inventories prevail in key markets such as Turkey and Italy, where traders holding stocks from high-priced imports are facing significant losses when disposing of material in store. Prices in Italy dipped below a $315/mt CIF duty unpaid equivalent this week, suggesting hits into the $60s/mt on some of the tonnage purchased earlier from China, Iran and Russia. Some suppliers nevertheless continue to add to stocks, likely in moves to relieve inventories at production units and loadports.
Mediterranen values are nevertheless assessed up on prior weeks, but this refers to the current absence of low-priced offers from Iran into the region. Reports of repeat offers at last week's $305/mt CFR duty paid assessment could not be confirmed at press time.
As indicated last week, prospects of lower short-term demand from the US and Brazil will coincide with output from Safco V, currently undergoing pre-commissioning trials, and trials are also proceeding well at the Oman-Algeria joint venture units. Issues with ammonia output at three units in Qatar are also likely to be resolved by early April, increasing urea output back up to rated capacity.
Egyptian producers are again suffering from cuts in natural gas, but imported LNG should alleviate some of those problems, as suggested in several prior issues. Major exports are however not expected in the short term, as financial constraints will continue to limit possible imports of urea and AN, necessitating maximum allocations of urea from indigenous units.
East of Suez, the disparity between netbacks in the domestic market in China and returns form export trades continues to grow, but the inflow of material to ports for export is yet to be materially influenced by the spread. Demand for spring direct application will prevail for some time still, but prospects of directing significant additional volumes at current prices to the domestic market appear limited. A sizeable increase in availability would likely trigger some domestic price deterioration.

26 March 2015
Offers into the export market are however up on the levels at which traders were prepared to short the market or dispose of inventories last week. Granular urea is relatively stable around an even $280/mt FOB and traders that shorted prills down to the low $260s/mt FOB and beyond are so far unable to secure profitable cover. Indications from sellers for late April and May positions based on lower raw material costs are however still suggested into the $260s/mt FOB for prills while granular was indicated available around $275/mt FOB.
FSU prilled values were relatively stable week-on-week via sales from the Baltic at producer-netbacks into the upper $250s/mt FOB for prills while granular traded at $280/mt FOB. Black Sea prices have so far been holding up better, but deterioration below the $263/mt FOB low end in recent assessments can still not be excluded.
Highlights of the Week
A slow week, but downward trend yet to ease
US barge values lose ground despite profitable inland prices. Middle East netbacks adjust accordingly for US-bound parcels Egyptian granular trades at $300/mt FOB for the Mediterranean
Brazilian delivered values down further
Qafco II, V and VI ammonia units due to restart soon SIUCI books cargo with Quantum to be priced ahead of loading
European granular values up marginally on stronger euro Traders holding length face major losses in Italy and Turkey Tenders in India and Pakistan yet to emerge
Granular urea trades lower in South Korea Domestic/export price-spread in China increases All-time-high Chinese exports through February
Short term outlook
The urea market remains supply-driven. Demand is perceived stable to low in key import markets, but further deterioration in delivered values is expected to trigger some emergence of pent-up demand.
As is evident from the various country-entries in this report, sentiment in paper markets this week spell doom and gloom across the board, but some of the more pessimistic views may well be ahead of reality as may emerge.
A major rebound in values outside the US is however unlikely in the short term unless recent events in the Middle East significantly impact energy prices to trigger accelerated purchasing by endusers fearing substantial increases in feedstock costs.
US granular urea prices appear to have the best prospects for short to medium term improvement, but some traders continue to sell barges at lower levels despite more profitable options in the US interior.

MARKET UPDATES
THE AMERICAS
US MIDWEST
Movement expected soon for corn, spring wheat in US Midwest
Granular urea values still are cited at $330-335/st FOB from river terminals along the upper Mississippi River, but higher prices remain the rule from inland warehouses in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana and Ohio, as well as from most warehouses in Wisconsin and Michigan.
Field work likely will get underway for urea applications within days, but ammonia movement is dominating the nitrogen market across the regions for now. Urea still is favored for spring wheat and in the western reaches of the Midwest.
It remains to be seen if the lower prices seen for replacement tons out of the US Gulf put even more downward pressure on inland prices.
US NOLA
Cheaper barges rule again in New Orleans market
Granular urea barges are cheaper again this week, with trade confirmed at $268-286/st FOB New Orleans by traders for prompt, non-Chinese loads. This is $8-9/st below the bottom end of last week's range and $18-19/st below that week's midpoint. The lowest priced sale of Chinese granular urea was reported at $272/st FOB this week.
Even though traders do not report a substantial lineup of unsold barges along the lower Mississippi River, the number of bids has been modest due to wet weather in much of the Southern Plains market. This has delayed seasonal demand in that region.
The decline in US values still leaves Middle East producers with a modest incentive to favor sales to the US versus many other world markets.

US SOUTHERN PLAINS
Flat pricing for prompt and forward truckloads
Granular urea quotes for trucks to be loaded in April or May are cited at $330/st FOB by some suppliers along the Arkansas River this week. Slightly higher prices for prompt material are reported in Texas and Arkansas.
Wet weather has delayed demand in Oklahoma and elsewhere.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
BALTIC SEA
Grodno indicates high netbacks from overland markets
The March 24 GrodnoAzot tender for the sale of up to 25,000 mt granular urea did not result in sales of major quantities for destinations serviced by shipment from Klaipeda. The producer did however suggest that small lots for overland delivery to nearby Baltic markets were booked in the session at FCA values from the plant indicative of netbacks above a $290/mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent.
The session called for bids for the material to be loaded from the plant March-April, and requested 100% prepayment in euro latest within March 27.
The suggested Grodno deals have not been taken into account in assessing the granular urea value. This has been based on known trades for deliveries via vessel, and on netbacks in recent sales.
Prilled values are also assessed basis trades concluded on CFR terms by producers and marketers.
BLACK SEA
Producers yet to accept calls for discounts
Traders short on prior sales in nearby markets from the Black Sea are so far fighting an uphill battle to secure cover at numbers generating margins. Most recent deals in Turkey were indicative

of returns to the sellers in the low $260s/mt FOB, necessitating cover in the $250s/mt FOB. Bids for additional quantities from Turkish buyers reflect netbacks some $5/mt lower.
Producers and marketers are holding out for returns in line with last week's deals, at a minimum of $263/mt FOB, and some quotes are still closer to $270/mt FOB. Given the lack of alternative outlets, short traders do however appear set to win the game for lower April prices at the end.
The perceived trend is evident in paper markets. Offers for April Yuzhnyy positions at FIS Cash Settled Swaps March 26 at $255/mt FOB were countered with bids at $248/mt FOB. The bid-offer spread for May was $240/mt-$250/mt FOB and May was posted at $235- $245/mt FOB.
Shipments in March are likely to total about 131,000 mt with
the majority heading for Turkey, and April nominations are so far limited to one vessel for Nitora, also likely for Turkey:

EUROPE
FRANCE
Buyers of granular urea hold off
Prospects of possible further declines in granular urea values have served to sideline French distributors. While down on quotes last week at €330/mt FCA, offers for prompt and forward tonnage around an even €325/mt FCA in the French Bay are not eliciting significant acceptances.
Apart from the overall decline in international values for granular urea, distributors cite the improvement close to 3.8% in the value of the euro against the US dollar in support of calls for offers below €320/mt FCA. The European currency traded marginally above $1.10 this week versus March 19 quotes closer to $1.06.
A €325/mt FCA quote at the current exchange rate reflects about $348/mt CIF, duty paid, suggesting Egyptian producer- netbacks marginally above $310/mt FOB after freight, costs and a small margin to an intermediary. A drop to €320/mt FCA would yield about $342/mt CIF and a correspondingly lower Egyptian return.
Egyptian urea menwhile traded at an even $300/mt FOB, albeit for a small lot for a nearby market.
TURKEY
Vertiqal books prills with Turkish Group
The Group of Importers in southern Turkey has booked 20,000 mt prilled urea with Vertiqal to load in April. Exact details on the pricing and payment terms were not released, but the deal was reportedly done at $283/mt CFR, inclusive of 270 days credit.

MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
EGYPT
HFC books granular urea for Greece
Reports from Cairo suggest that Helwan secured a sale this week of up to 7,000 mt granular urea for prompt loading from port inventory already cleared for export at a $300/mt FOB netback. The producer had previously denied reports of a $295/mt FOB sale.
The purported new deal is indicative of a cost around $320/mt CFR to a main Greek port, duty paid. That number would equate to about $300/mt CFR, duty unpaid.
This would imply netbacks below $280/mt FOB for dutiable product from the Black Sea, basis a similar lot. The return for dutiable Middle East origin would be around $265/mt FOB, based on shipment of a cargo of about 12-15,000 mt.
Further to earlier reports, news on the expected Egyptian tender for the import of urea and AN to make up for the shortfall from domestic production due to continuing cuts in supply of natural gas had yet to emerge at press time.
The perceived trend in paper markets is down. Offers for
April positions from Egypt at FIS Cash Settled Swaps March 26 at $310/mt FOB were countered with bids at $302/mt FOB. The bid- offer spread for May was $300/mt-$308/mt FOB and May was posted at $298-$308/mt FOB.

IRAN
Iranian urea exports up further
Exports of urea identified by customs via GTIS from Iran in February 2015 of 186,000 mt were up by 471% on February 2014. Brazil accounted for 77,000 mt while France and Belgium were registered with 33,000 mt each. Deliveries to India were 18,000 mt.
The January-February export volume of 319,000 mt was up by 126.7% with Brazil accounting for 115,000 mt. Shipments to India of 56,000 mt were down by 34% on the prior year while deliveries to Iraq reached 54,000 mt.
Netbacks for granular slide further
Middle East producers of granular urea are faced with increasing pressure on prices in all key markets, but a spot sale is nevertheless suggested at $268/mt FOB. A cargo for April loading was also booked on formula pricing from Oman, destined for Australia.
Firm offers in Brazil off inbound carriers have dipped into
the low $280s/mt CFR, according to Brazilian importers. These imply netbacks to sellers no better than $260/mt FOB after deduction of freight, less provisions for costs and margins to intermediaries. Thai importers also cite offers below $290/mt CFR.
US barge values for April that slipped to below $270/st FOB New Orleans equate to $287/mt CFR and were indicative of producer- netbacks around $265/mt FOB Middle East marker
also offered limited comfort this week.
The low end of Middle East granular values was thus
perceived below FOB values for FSU prills, an occurance recently only seen in Q4 2007 and subsequently in Q3 2014 when Black Sea prices were supported by limited output and pockets of regional demand.
Availability of from Qafco has been reduced via the unplanned ammonia outages at Qafco III, V and VI, but the producer expects that all units will be operating regularly by the end of March or latest by April 4.
The trend is significatly lower in paper markets. Offers for
April Middle East positions at FIS Cash Settled Swaps March 26 at $258/mt FOB were countered with bids at $255/mt FOB. The bid- offer spread for May was $250/mt-$256/mt FOB and May was posted at $248-$254/mt FOB.

INDIA
April 2014-February 2015 Indian imports up 13.2%
Indian April-February 2014-2015 imports of 7.84 million mt were up by 13.2% on the same period in 2013-2014 according to the latest provisional FAI trade data.
Sales of urea totalled 28.4 million mt during April 2014-February 2015, down by 0.1% on the prior year. The February
volume marginally above 2.7 million mt was however up on the 2.05 million mt delivered in February 2014, and followed an increase
in January 2015 to 3.12 million mt from the 3 million mt sold in January 2014.
Domestic production of urea was a shade short of 1.7 million mt
in February 2015, bringing the total close to 21 million mt in the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year. This was down by 0.7% on the 21.08 million mt produced April 2013-February 2014.
India: UREA SALES, PRODUCTION, IMPORTS – FEBRUARY 2015 (MT)
Closing stocks with states were at a mere 227,000 mt at the end of February, but that quantity does not include imported quantities in ports and urea en-route to Indian states. Illustrating the disparity, there were 12 vessels waiting to discharge urea in Indian ports March 19, carrying a total of 580,000 mt.
A significant portion of quantities procured via the 1.15 million mt purchases in the December 3 IPL tender had not reached individual Indian states at the time the data was collected, and multiple shipments of the 1.03 million mt booked via the January 27 MMTC tender are yet to arrive in Indian ports.
DoF instructions to STC still awaited
Instructions from the Department of Fertilizers (DoF) to STC on the additional tender for urea suggested imminent in recent weeks had yet to emerge at press time. As was the case last week, some observers still believe a tender could be announced in a day or two while others expect no news before the first days of April, mainly due to lack of immediate funding.
The DoF is following developments in the international urea market closely, and appears to subscribe to the view that a delayed issuance of the tender will increase competition for the upcoming business, thus triggering lower offers from suppliers. Targets around a $270/mt CFR ECI level are widespread in the Delhi rumour-mill.
The CFR India price posting has meanwhile been adjusted this week to reflect CIL's recent purchase of 35,000 mt Chinese urea at $282/mt CFR.
NEPAL
AICL/Nepal to tender May 7
AICL has floated a tender for the purchase of 35,000 mt urea in 50 kilo bags, closing May 7 at 13:00hrs Kathmandu time. Offers with a validity of minimum 21 days from the closing date are requested for the urea to be delivered to AICL inland warehouses in Birgunj (17,500 mt), Bhairahawa (10,000 mt) and Biratnagar (7,500 mt). Delivery of 50% of the total quantity is requested within 97 days from the date of L/C issuance with the balance to be delivered within 20 days thereafter.
AICL awarded the February 23 tender for 35,000 mt bagged urea to Samsung at the trader's offer at $376.60/mt CPT for the same delivery points.
The tender May 7 also calls for offers for 20,000 mt bagged DAP.
PAKISTAN
ECC clearance for TCP tender still awaited
As was reported last week, Pakistan's Fertilizer Review Committee (FRC) cleared a proposal to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to import up to 350,000 mt urea due to reduced output from indigenous units via curtailments in supply of natural gas.
The FRC had initially identified the shortage at 380,000 mt, including buffers, but local reports continue to suggest that the final quantity will be 330-350,000 mt, subject to ECC approval.
As in the case of India, a tender is unlikely to occur in March and clearance for one or more sessions for the total quantity may only emerge in the second week of April, if approved by the ECC.

CHINA
Chinese February urea exports exceed 1.29 million mt
As was indicated in the March 23 Market Alert, exports of urea identified by Chinese customs via GTIS in the short month of February were 1.29 million mt. This brought the January-February exports to an all-time high of 2.97 million mt, up by 127.4% on the same two months in 2014.
The 1.29 million mt February volume was up by 82.2% on February 2014. India accounted for 304,000 mt. Shipments to the Americas were up sharply with the US taking 233,000 mt and deliveries to Mexico of 133,000 mt. Ecuador and Chile were close to 95,000 each and shipments to Colombia reached 82,000 mt. Deliveries to Peru went from zero to 50,000 mt.
January-February shipments to India of 1.18 million mt were up by 267% on the prior year and deliveries to the US of 413,000 mt were up by 48.4%. Shipments to Mexico of 144,000 mt were up by a full 601%. Deliveries to Pakistan registered a decline of 16.4% to 139,000 mt while shipments to Chile were up from zero to 119,000 mt. South Korea accounted for 105,000 mt, up by 154% on the prior year.
Domestic/export spread widens
The domestic market for prilled urea moved up on demand for spring application, further lifting the spread between domestic netbacks and export returns. Mainstream quotes in Shandong were up to RMB 1,600/mt ($258/mt) EXW.
Sales of prills were also concluded lower, down to RMB 1,500/mt ($241/mt) EXW in Shanxi, largely destined for export.
Quotes for prills into main ports such as Yantai were marginally below RMB 1,600/mt ($257/mt) CPT, indicative of an export value in the low $280s/mt FOB.
As was the case last week, quotes for export from traders holding inventory are significantly lower, and the spread for the week is assessed at $268-273/mt FOB based on bids and offers in the market. Deals projecting significantly lower netbacks are considered to be short positions, and are therefore not taken into account when assessing the week's range.
Domestic values for granular urea were stable around RMB1,560- 1,580/mt ($251-$254/mt) FCA in Shanxi, for an equivalent $298/mt FOB value, also substantially below actual export netbacks. Offers for granular urea from Chinese suppliers and bids from traders are used to assess the nominal export value at $278-283/mt FOB.
Returns on sales by traders believed to have taken short positions down to $270/mt FOB for granular have not been included as these are yet to elicit selling interest on the part of suppliers.
Inventories in ports are assessed up on last week, with stocks of about 260,000 mt granular urea and 200,000 mt prills in Yantai alone. Qingdao stocks are assessed at a total of 150,000 mt. Total port inventory is estimated close to 900,000 mt.
Paper-markets largely matched the most bearish players in the physical market for prills. March 26 offers for April lots from China at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $258/mt FOB attracted bids no higher than $253/mt FOB. The bid-offer spread for May was $250-$255/mt FOB while June postings were at $245-$255/mt FOB.
SOUTH KOREA
Low price suggested in Namhae tender
The March 20 Namhae tender for 6,000 mt granular urea was booked by a trader with Chinese material. The buyer did not reveal details on identity of the seller and the price concluded, but local reports suggest that a deal was struck in line with Dongbu's March 16 tender purchase, marginally above $285/mt CFR.

THAILAND
Thai importers cite lower quotes
As in the case of Brazil, Thai importers indicate that offers for good quality granular are abundant below $295/mt CFR, and that Middle East quality product can be purchased below $290/mt CFR. Interest in additional cargos remains subdued.
Offers for Chinese granular are suggested even lower, in line with netbacks derived from recent regional trades reported around $288/mt CFR for small parcels.
