Fertilizer Shipping Market Report
1sth Feb – 5th Feb
It has been another poor week for the shipping market. Rates remain depressed as the BDI continues to battle further down to new lows. Charterers have been busy covering their stems before the Chinese festive season, but owners fighting to get their hands on any firm and fresh business, pushing the rates further down. Bunker prices have been somewhat volatile over the course of the week, it is to be seen what will happen next week when the Chinese are off.
Seeing more and more ships now already heading for, or seriously considering to lay up.
HANDYSIZE
Current trend: DOWN
In Atlantic here has been yet another slow week with few fresh requirement and rates still under pressure. Still very few cargoes to East Coast South America, and the ones that enter the market are disappearing quickly.
In the Far East there has been a slight increase in activity, with charterers wanting to cover before the holiday. However as owners want to cover as well, the rates being fixed are still under pressure.
Outlook: DOWN
Expect next week to be another slow week.
SUPRAMAX
Current trend: DOWN
Same as for other sizes there has been a slight increase in number of cargoes before the upcoming holiday. Freight levels being done are still under pressure though, as owners are equally, if not more keen to cover before next week. Some owners are accepting even negative return daily for hauls bringing them into the Atlantic. Still plenty of available spot tonnage around.
Outlook: DOWN
Expect the levels might drop further next week, assuming limited fresh requirements in the market, until the Chinese are back.
PANAMAX
Current trend: DOWN
Inevitably the pressure remains on the owners and the hire rates, with a scramble to fix their tonnage before the Chinese New Year. The rates did however flatten out a bit in both basis, and for certain routes we are seeing an increase in levels. Ecsa still remains the driver but certainly less fresh activity in the area. Very few aussie or coal stems from Indonesia have been seen in the market, and owners are increasingly quiet about the levels to which they have fixed.
Outlook: DOWN
We expect it to be quieter over the coming week
