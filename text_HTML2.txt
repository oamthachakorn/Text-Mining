Quarterly Freight review: Volumes
The start of 2015 came with a mixed bag for fertilizer ship- pers on the major Class I railroads as fertilizer solutions and input chemicals reported different results.
The amount of fertilizer inputs moving by rail declined on five of the seven major US carriers in the first quarter compared with the 2014 period. But overall fertilizer traffic dipped by just 1.6pc across all the carriers to 6.9mn short tons (6.3mn metric tonnes) on the strength of a one-third
increase in traffic on the US operations of Canadian National (CN). CN moved 307,552st of fertilizer inputs in the quarter.
Rates for input chemicals declined at every carrier except CSX, where the cost to move fertilizer inputs gained 3.6pc to $9.03/st.
The volume of super-phosphate solutions on most of the US operations of the Class I railroads and but overall sector

traffic rose by 1.1pc to 5.7mn st because of a 48pc reduc- tion in Kansas City Southern traffic. The small Class I moved 10,191st of coal in the quarter compared with 19,739 in first quarter 2014. The stronger volume environment at most of the carriers supported higher rates for super-phosphate solu- tions at a majority of the carriers. Overall rates added 2.4pc to $31.61/st across all the railroads.
The western railroads took stronger price increases on their
traffic than the average with BNSF rates up by 7.2pc to
$44.25/st in first quarter 2015 while Union Pacific (UP) pric- ing gained 3.9pc. Shippers of fertilizer chemicals and super- phosphates ended first quarter 2015 at $48.82/st.
Rates in the east were mixed, but lower on an absolute level than their western counterparts, at least in part because of shorter lengths of haul.

Fundamentals
Agriculture
Weather: Tropical Storm Bill pushed through the Texas coast this week, though the state did not sustain flood dam-
age similar to that induced by heavy storms at the end of May. Storms in the Midwest were much more pronounced, stretching from the Mississippi Delta to the upper Northeast. While precipitation dissipated over most of the country by mid-week, rainfall hung over east Texas and Missouri, whose crop progress is already well behind the five-year average. The 6-10 day forecast shows unusually dry weather through- out the south and Mississippi Delta, though most of the Corn Belt and Northeast should see rainfall, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Temperatures will also likely rise to above-average marks in the lower Atlantic and southern Corn Belt. The western Corn Belt and plains are expected to stay dry and show average temperatures in the next 6-10 days.
Crop progress: Plantings and crop conditions were mostly
6-10 day precipitation outlook
in line with previous weekly reports and five-year averages, though soybean plantings still trail their average rates, especially in Missouri and Kansas, which have seen an unusu- ally large amount of rain. US soybean plantings were 87pc finished the week ended 14 June, three percentage points behind the five-year average, according to the US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report. Plantings in Kansas were 57pc complete, down from the 85pc average, while Missouri had planted 42pc of its soybeans, down from the 79pc average. This year's Missouri soybean plantings are at the slowest rate since 1995.
Harvested winter wheat lagged behind the five-year aver- age for the second straight week, likely slowed by inclem- ent weather since the end of May. Overall winter wheat was 11pc harvested, down nine percentage points from the average. Winter wheat conditions were rated 22pc poor and very poor, while good and excellent ratings were 43pc of the total crop. Spring wheat condition was rated 70pc good and excellent.

Overall corn progress held steady the week ended 14 June, with plantings two percentage points above the average at 97pc. Corn condition was also flat to the previous week at 73pc rated good and excellent.
Crop prices: Storms in the US Gulf coast and Midwest proved bullish from front-month crop prices this week, especially for soybeans. With soybean plantings lagging and weather threatening late-season plantings, front-month soybean futures prices ended the week at $9.78/bushel, the highest close for the contract since 5 May. November soybean prices also climbed, ending the week at $9.42/bushel, the highest mark since 8 May and up nearly 40¢/bushel from early-week settlements.

Front-month corn prices also climbed on weather concerns. July corn prices ended the week at $3.58/bushel, a 10¢/ bushel rally from earlier in the week. December corn prices held steady week-on-week, fall 2¢/bushel to settle 18 June at 3.73/bushel.
Feedstock
US natural gas futures ended lower this week on a govern- ment report of a larger-than-average build in gas stockpiles and forecasts for milder weather in the coming weeks.
Nymex gas for July delivery fell by 7.8¢/mmBtu, or 2.7pc, to settle at $2.777/mmBtu. Prompt-month prices rose to a four-week settlement high earlier this week but surrendered some of those gains ahead of the US Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly inventory report.
US gas stockpiles rose in the week ended 12 June by 89 Bcf (2.5bn m³), the EIA said. The build was smaller than the previous three injections, all of which exceeded 100 Bcf, be- cause of hotter weather. Last week's injection fell short of analyst estimates for an increase of 92 Bcf, but it surpassed the five-year average injection for the week of 87 Bcf.
Inventories have increased rapidly this year on increased domestic output. Stockpiles last week rose to 2.433 Tcf — 43pc higher than a year earlier and 1.9pc above the five-year average.
The US rig count reached a 12-year low as weak oil prices forced producers to pull back drilling, but the shale indus- try's run is far from over, oil major BP said.
The rig count fell by nine to 859 this week, according to data from oilfield services company Baker Hughes. That's the low-
est since 17 January 2003 when it fell to 845. It surpassed the lowest level of the previous market crash of 2008-09, when it dropped to 876 on 12 June 2009.
The US shale boom allowed the US to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer and Russia as the larg- est producer of oil and gas, BP said in its annual Statistical Review said. US output increased by 1.6mn b/d last year, making the country the first ever to boost output by at least 1mn b/d a year for three consecutive years.
Freight
Fertilizer barge movements on most US rivers have slowed as a surge in high water has made navigation difficult and forced the closure of several locks and dams.
Recent rains in some northern tier states, including Michi- gan, Minnesota and North Dakota, helped create runoff to the rivers that drove up water levels on the Illinois and up- per Mississippi rivers.
Two Illinois river locks have been shut, preventing barges from moving north or south through the Starved Rock lock in Utica and the Marseilles lock in Marseilles. Barges continue to pass through high water at the Peoria lock in Creve Coeur and the LaGrange lock in Versailles because those locations have wicket dams that have been lowered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Dams at other locks are more perma- nent, requiring those sites to close in the high water.
Barge rates were unchanged this week after rising recently because of the high water and efforts by operators to limit storage. Some barge operators are offering higher spot rates for July because they are trying to hold onto more equip-

ment instead of allowing customers to use barges for storage until fall. Many are wary of releasing too much equipment this summer because they want to be sure to meet contract customer needs, a concern generated by last fall’s tight market.
St Louis barge rates held for a second week at $9-10.75/short ton. Barges continue to pass through the area but that may change if high water in the area persists.
If there is more rain in the next few days, operators may hold back northbound barges heading to the upper Mississip- pi and Illinois rivers for safety reasons. The Mississippi gauge at St Louis this morning was 33.2ft, above flood level of 30ft, and is expected to peak at 37.1ft by 22 June.
A tropical depression is heading for the for the middle Mis- sissippi and Ohio river valleys after making landfall along the central Texas coast on 16 June as a tropical storm before weakening.
Arkansas river barge traffic has again been slowed by high water, less than 10 days after the corps reopened all locks from a similar problem. The Mayo lock near Fort Smith, Arkansas, has been shut, blocking fertilizer barges heading
north towards Muskogee and Inola/Catoosa.
Barge rates to destinations between Pine Bluff and Little Rock were flat at $14.50-16.50/st after increasing last week. Traffic along the waterway remains restricted to six-barge tows that can only be operated in daylight.
Nitrogen
Sustained rice demand and short-covering sustained higher loaded/prompt urea prices this week, but July values were under pressure amid concerns of higher imports and im- pending domestic production increases. Meanwhile, UAN and other nitrogen products have seen a steadier decline to summer reset values.
Urea (g)
The urea barge market again traded in a wide range as traders placed a premium on loaded product, particularly as some scrambled to cover first-half June contract commit- ments.
That premium led to multiple loaded barge trades at $380/ st fob Nola, up by $10/st from the high end of last week’s assessment and marking the highest point since 17 July 2014. Prompt/June-loading barges trended in line with the prior week, trading from $346-355/st fob Nola, with prices held up by rice demand in the south and the last tail of corn top- dress demand.
July prices were harder to pin down because of scarce bids. First-half July, CF-specific barges traded at $320/st fob Nola and July non-Chinese traded at $314/st fob. But offers for first-half July dropped from the low/mid-$310s/st fob Nola mid-week to $305/st as of press time, setting the bottom end of this week’s assessment. In addition, an August-loading non-Chinese barge traded at $292/st fob Nola, nearly a $100/ st below loaded prices this week.
The lack of July buying interest came as traders assess a growing import lineup—a function of the $100/st price rally since April—most of which is likely to arrive after late-season demand has concluded. At least 260,000t of granular urea is estimated to arrive in July, with Saudi Arabia’s Sabic now planning to bring 60,000t to Nola in late July—its first of 10 cargoes for the US for the 2015-16 fertilizer year.
The US typically imports less urea in July because of an ebb in seasonal demand. However, it did import 250,000t during

July 2014 by vessel, compared to just 81,000t in 2013. In ad- dition to the estimated 260,000t for this July, a few vessels remain up in the air, with additional shipments from Algeria and Kuwait possible.
Continued barge delays on the Arkansas river kept ware- house prices firm in Inola/Catoosa and St Louis. Inola/ Catoosa urea inventory is nearing depletion with those with remaining tons consistently achieving $415/st fot. Only a few thousand tons are estimated still in Inola/Catoosa and barge resupply is still a ways off because of high-water restricting traffic on the Arkansas river (see Freight). The shortage in Inola/Catoosa has pulled prices up in St Louis, which climbed as high as $390/st fot as buyers look to truck urea from that hub to southern destinations. Northeastern Arkansas warehouses on the Mississippi river have also achieved $410/ st fot.
Prices in Cincinnati/Jeffersonville and Twin Cities were un- changed amid limited activity.

Prices for feed grade prilled urea firmed to $315/st fob Nola on latest sales off a July-arriving vessel. The feed grade prills assessment is adjusted to $310-315/st fob Nola accord- ingly, which is the highest since early April and up by $15/st from the low end of the prior assessment. Feed grade prills have traded at an atypical discount to Nola granular urea since 23 April, the second longest stretch since the assess-

International urea highlights
The global urea market was quiet in advance of India’s STC purchase tender that will close 19 June. STC is ex- pected to target 600,000-1mn t. Chinese offers firmed as a result, with granular rising to $315/t fob and prills at $310-315/t fob. Chinese producers are taking a firm stance because of strong expected demand in India and a longer than usual tail to domestic demand.
In Algeria, Nitron is loading 20,000t of granular urea this month, with 14,000t bound for the US and the balance headed to France. The new AOA plant there is still reported to be down as it goes through the commissioning process. Sorfert operations are normal.
In Egypt, Mopco began test runs on its new 650,000 t/ yr Mopco I line on 14 June. Its existing 650,000 t/yr Mopco
IIIline remains down because of insufficient gas supply.

UAN
The US UAN market was inactive this week with a band of severe, wet weather bringing an unexpected and early close to side dress applications in some areas. Meanwhile, there are still offers for preliminary summer fill with a major US producer expected to announce its price level imminently.
A band of wet weather that hit key production areas, in par- ticular the east Corn Belt, over the last week has derailed sidedress applications and could leave some suppliers with unexpectedly high carryover. Corn is expected to be too tall for further applications once soils have dried sufficiently for fieldwork to resume.
Preliminary fill tons are offered by at least one domestic

producer and importers in the range of $210-215/st fob Nola. There have been some reports of lower priced offers, but not widely available.
Consensus is that a major US producer will announce its fill program shortly at about $215/st fob Nola, about $25/st lower than last year.
The latest east coast import business concluded at $235/t cfr for July arrival. Seller price indications have increased to at or near $240/t cfr, particularly as a summer turnaround of a Russian producer’s facility has removed some cargoes from the typical US lineup. However, potential buyers are resist- ing prices above the $235/t cfr mark.
Although movement to the field has been limited, terminal prices have yet to move toward summer fill values—likely because the remaining inventory was purchased at higher, in-season values. Latest offers are heard in the range of $280-295/st fob Nola for UAN32.
Ammonium nitrate (p)
Demand remains lackluster for ammonium nitrate. Barge
length on the river continues to pressure buy price ideas, but no new business was confirmed this week. The Nola as- sessment is unchanged at $260-265/st fob Nola.
Warehouse prices in Tampa and the Mid South are stable. Latest prices in the lower Ohio river valley are heard near $345/st fot.
Ammonium sulfate (g)
Ammonium sulfate prices are stable, with limited supply offsetting lower seasonal Corn Belt demand. Producers are focused on building fall inventory with spring demand concluded.
Houston/Pasadena prices are unchanged at $260/st fot as producers look to complete seasonal commitments before considering a summer fill price. Given the nationwide tight- ness of amsul, some are not ruling out the possibility of flat summer pricing. In the Northern Plains, fill prices have been discussed around $300-310/st delivered, depending on loca- tion.
Amsul production on the Texas Gulf Coast was minimally impacted by Tropical Storm Bill, which made landfall on 16 June southwest of Houston. Producers reported normal load- ing operations during the storm.
Ammonia
Prices in the US ammonia market continued to soften this week with the end of side dress season hastened by a sud- den and severe bout of wet weather hitting the east Corn Belt. Corn is now expected to be too tall for further ap- plications by the time saturated soils have dried out. This has caused an earlier than expected cutoff for offtake this season, and could result in increased carryout for suppliers in the region.
East Corn Belt prices moved to $590-610/st fot, a $10/st decline from last week’s range. There was little if any buying at these levels, but offers have drifted only marginally lower given the tight inventory situation.
In the west Corn Belt there has been little or no business concluded and prices are still discussed in the wide range of $525-590/st fot, with the high end farther east.
Distributors have yet to move to summer fill values as there is little sense of urgency to sell with inventories lean despite

the weather-shortened season. Instead, the near-term focus will be on rebuilding stocks ahead of fall demand, with some light fill selling likely later in the summer.
However, most producers have moved to summer fill pric-
ing. In Oklahoma, offers have moved to the $470-480/st fob range. Meanwhile, there are reports a Texas producer is selling summer-loading tons at $450/st fot. In the Dakotas, a producer will issue fill pricing shortly, likely at a price in the mid-$500s/st delivered.

Last summer, prices at Oklahoma production sites bottomed at $440/st fob in June before topping $600/st fob in August.
International ammonia highlights
A fire that shut down Yara’s Brunsbuttel, Germany, am- monia plant has led the company to secure 20,000t for July loading from the Baltic. The cargo was purchased from more than one supplier at $400/t fob Ventspils and Silla- mae.
In Turkey, Trammo has been awarded the Petkim tender for 6,000t for early-July delivery at about $410/t cfr, which nets back to about $380/t fob Yuzhny.
CJ Indonesia has awarded its tender for 6,000t for early- July delivery to local supplier Petrokimia Gresik in the high-$440s/t cfr.
Phosphate
The US phosphate market remains stable but thinly traded with demand seasonally limited.
DAP barge prices remain within a tight $418-420/st fob Nola range amid slim buying interest. DAP prices appear to have hit a floor, with the US market at a significant discount to other markets limiting downside. However, price upside could be limited by low crop prices that may result in a de- cline in fall grower demand. The paper market underscores this flat trend with prices for August/September virtually even with prompt values.
The US import lineup for the third quarter for now consists of one expected DAP/MAP vessel from Morocco’s OCP—likely a contractual shipment for PotashCorp. Additional spot car- goes from Morocco have been treated with skepticism given Nola’s low prices, especially relative to Brazil.
In exports, Mosaic sold 17,000t DAP to various Latin Ameri- can markets for July shipment at $470-474/t fob Tampa, down slightly from last business.
Higher shipments to India and Latin American countries boosted US exports of DAP/MAP in May to their highest monthly total since May 2014.
The US exported 236,180st P2O5 of DAP/MAP (estimated 450,000-510,000st product) in May, a 33.8pc month-on- month climb but down 4.8pc from the same month last year,

according to the Fertilizer Institute (TFI).
The US shipped 75,945st P2O5 to India in May, the highest monthly total since October 2014 and the second consecu- tive month it has sent exports to the major DAP consumer since October-November 2014. These shipments were up about 63pc both from May 2014 and April 2015. Year-to- date shipments to the country are up 73.1pc compared to January-May 2014.
The US exported 113,640st P2O5 to South American coun- tries in May, the largest sum since June 2014. May shipments to the region were up 41.7pc from April but down 11.5pc from the same month last year. Exports to Brazil were 87,090st P2O5, in line with April, while shipments to Colom- bia and Peru totaled 15,683st and 10,867st, respectively. The US exported 9,532st to Central American countries, 8,366st of which went to Guatemala.
The US did not export any DAP/MAP to Australia in May for the second month in a row. Calendar year-to-date exports to Australia stand at 71,114st P2O5, down 32.7pc from January- May 2014.
Canada received 10,047st P2O5 in May from the US, down 46.1pc month-on-month and a 79.3pc fall from the same month last year. The US exported 11,736st P2O5 to Mexico in May, down 18.5pc from April and 31.8pc from May 2014.
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
Higher May exports led January-May US P2O5 exports to reach 869,339st, a 3.4pc year-over-year increase.
US phosphoric acid exports jumped in May after lagging in previous months, reaching 35,396st P2O5, a 27.5pc jumped from the same month last year. India received 52.4pc of all US shipments, with Brazil, Mexico and Canada rounding out the remaining supply. Phosphoric acid exports for the calen- dar year-to-date are down 18.5pc to 111,233st P2O5.
DAP/MAP
DAP barge prices were steady this week with trades for July-loading domestic tons at $419/st fob Nola. Bid/offers for physical barges bracketed either side of that level, upholding the prior $418-420/st fob Nola range. A domestic DAP barge traded this week at $425/st fob Nola, but was excluded from the range because of specific circumstances that made it not representative of the market, according to the seller. No MAP trades were confirmed, but the product continues to be indicated at a $5-10/st premium to DAP.
DAP/MAP warehouse demand is seasonally limited and prices unchanged from last week. Some wholesalers still have post- ed DAP prices of $460-465/st fot, particularly on the Ohio river, but no substantial sales at that level were confirmed.
International phosphate highlights
In Brazil, phosphate-based fertilizer consumption shrank by 19.1pc to 1.15mn t in the first five months of 2015 because of a decline in demand in sugar cane and second- crop corn sectors, as well as a decline in purchases for the upcoming soy planting season which begins in September, according to industry association Anda. Domestic phosphate production rose by 4.2pc, while imports fell by nearly 27pc in the January to May period. Brazilian fertilizers sales are expected to decline this year for the first time since 2009,
0
according to market estimates. The bulk of the decline will come from imports, with domestic production increas- ing. This sluggishness has contributed to a bearish tone in prices, with MAP offers dipping as low as $490s/t cfr.
In Argentina, a trader sold 30,000t Australian DAP at $505-507/t cfr for July shipment, while China’s YUC sold June MAP at $500-505/t cfr to this market.
China produced 4.3mn t of DAP and 2.9mn t of MAP in the first quarter, which are year-over-year increases of 17pc and 13pc, respectively, according to the China Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry. China exported 935,000t DAP and 481,000t MAP in the first quarter, according to customs data--both substantially higher year-over-year because of the country's move to a flat year-round export tax.
Potash
The North American market remains in a seasonal lull ahead of formal summer fill price announcements.
Non-Belarusian import barges for June/July-loading traded this week within the prevailing $315-325/st fob Nola range, though activity was limited given scant prompt application demand. There has been discussion of offers possibly as low as $310/st fob Nola, but no business has been confirmed lower than $315/st fob.
Last week, the Nola MOP assessment reached its lowest point since February 2014. The assessment is $43/st lower than this time last year on a midpoint basis. It has also dropped by $43/st since the beginning of 2015.
Warehouse prices were also flat on limited demand, with
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
Corn Belt prices still indicated at $360-375/st fot. Buyers are awaiting summer fill prices, which could be introduced by the end of the month. For now, Canadian producers are oc- cupied by fulfilling contractual standard MOP obligations to China and India while also shipping granular MOP tonnage to consignment warehouses within the US.
North American potash producers and buyers are looking to Brazil for signs of support for granular MOP prices globally. The Nola potash premium to Brazil stands at about $15/t, the slimmest margin since March 2014 and down by more than $30/t from March 2015.
Import data suggests Brazil still needs to buy a substantial amount of tonnage. Imports over the first five months of 2015 of 2.3mn t are down 30pc year-over-year, with Canada, Russia, Belarus and Chile all seeing a drop off in shipments, according to customs data. Market expectation is for more buying to take place, leading to higher Brazil cfr offers for July and August from producers, but upside could be limited by the depreciating real and unfavorable crop prices relative to fertilizer prices.
Brazilian potash demand fell by 17.9pc to 1.35mn t in the first five months of 2015 from the same period a year earlier, with domestic production up by 1.1pc and imports down
by nearly 25pc compared to the same five-month period of 2014, according to Brazilian fertilizer industry association Anda.

In Chile, SQM could be facing the revocation of its mining concessions in the Salar de Atacama by Corfo, the Chilean state-owned economic development agency. Salar Atacama is the source for SQM’s MOP and SOP products, among oth- ers. Its NOP-based products are sourced from outside the
Salar de Atacama and would theoretically be unaffected if SQM lost its concession. See Fertilizer news for more.
In India, ICL is understood to be close to finalizing supply contracts with Indian buyers, likely totaling near 680,000t. If confirmed, the commitments would bring total firm contracted tonnage to India to about 4.3mn t, with an ad- ditional 550,000t optional.
Allana Potash shareholders this week approved the acquisition of the company and its Ethiopian potash project by Israel’s ICL. ICL in March offered to buy all the outstand- ing shares of Allana for about $110mn. The transaction is expected to close around 22 June. The deal is subject to the approval of Ontario’s Superior Court of Justice, among other conditions. The Ethiopian project has estimated ca- pacity of 1mn t/yr MOP, while preliminary studies into SOP production have also been made.
Global sulfur prices
Sulfur and sulfuric acid
Brazil MOP imports
Sulfur
The US sulfur market is balanced, with no disruption stem- ming from heavy storms along the US Gulf coast. Tropical storm Bill hit the Texas coast 16 June, forcing Shell to evacu- ate personnel from its offshore facilities and causing minor
9.0refinery issues (see Operations News). But the actual impact on sulfur movements was negligible. Truck loadings from
8.7refineries were uninterrupted and domestic barge activity
8.4had no issues.

In Canada, sulfur loadings at Syncrude’s facilities, which had been halted because of internal H2S limits, have resumed. The oil consortium stopped truck loadings last week at its

facilities in the Alberta oil sands after restarting shipments just the week prior. Syncrude has revised its internal limits on H2S content from 30ppm to 50ppm, which likely contrib- uted to its ability to resume shipments.
International sulfur highlights
In China, new sales and firm bids have moved granular prices up slightly to a range of $162-165/t cfr China. End-us- ers in China confirm receiving offers in the low-$160s/t cfr. With freight from the Middle East quoted at $13-17/t (south- north China), the netback has moved up to the $150/t fob Middle East mark.
Sulfuric acid
PCS will close its sulfur-burned sulfuric acid plant at Geis- mar, Louisiana, by 18 June, according to the company, putting an end to the long-anticipated shutdown. The plant was originally scheduled to close 31 May, but that deadline was pushed back to a date that was "most advantageous to the company." PCS is closing the facility because of expenses
needed to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The company cut emissions related to phosphoric acid production at the fertilizer production site in 2013.
The plant consumes an estimated 150,000 t/yr of sulfur to make around 450,000 t/yr of sulfuric acid, and will now pro- cure its supply in the merchant market. It is understood that the majority of the facility’s sulfuric acid needs have been covered on a contractual basis, but market participants expect PCS to take some tonnes from the spot market.
International sulfuric acid highlights
In Cuba, the second sulfuric acid plant at Sherritt's Moa facility is expected to be operational by the final quarter of 2016, slightly pushed back from estimates announced back in March. The burner will have 2,000 t/day of sulfuric acid production capacity (around 667 t/d of sulfur consumption). Once operational, it will reduce its import requirements accordingly.

CF to expand Courtright urea capacity
CF Industries will expand the urea-based product capacity at its Courtright nitrogen fertilizer complex in Sarnia, Ontario, by 130,000 st/yr with an $85mn debottlenecking project.
Debottleneck work at Courtright's existing urea plant will be- gin in 2015 and is expected to be done in the fourth quarter of 2017, concurrent with a planned turnaround. Courtright has an existing average urea capacity of 160,000 st/yr.
The expansion will increase CF's ability to produce granu- lar urea, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and urea liquor at the plant. Courtright has an average gross ammonia capacity of 500,000 st/yr and UAN capacity of 345,000 st/yr.
The Courtright expansion follows major projects at CF's nitrogen plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, which are on track to be completed in 2016. Com- bined, those two expansions will add an estimated 2.1mn st/ yr gross ammonia, 2mn-2.7mn st/yr of granular urea and up to 1.8mn st/yr of UAN, depending on product mix, according to CF's annual report.
Chile’s SQM risks losing mining concession
Corfo, Chile´s state-owned economic development agency, is hardening its stance against SQM in an effort to strip the
company of its rich mining concession in the northern Chil- ean saltbed known as Salar de Atacama.
SQM and Corfo have been in arbitration over the matter since 16 May 2014. Corfo asserts that SQM has not honored concession payments and has blocked out competitors, claims that SQM has denied. In recent months, a tax fraud and illegal campaign finance scandal engulfing SQM have deepened the rift in the wake of a cabinet shake-up trig- gered by the ongoing controversy.
Corfo is expected to reject an arbitration judge´s recom- mendations at the next arbitration meeting on 9 July, seek- ing instead to revoke the Salar de Atacama lease. SQM said on 18 June that it has not been informed that Corfo plans to abandon the arbitration process.
The Salar de Atacama is the source for SQM´s MOP, SOP, lithium carbonate, boric acid and magnesium chloride. Ac- cording to SQM, revenues from products derived from this raw material accounted for 39pc of its consolidated revenue in 2014. SQM produces its NOP-based products from caliche ore sourced outside the Salar de Atacama, and this would (in theory) be unaffected if SQM lost its concessions in the Salar de Atacama.

Weather delays progress for wheat, soy: USDA
Rainy weather over most of May delayed soybean plantings and the winter wheat harvest, according to the US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report.
US soybean plantings were 87pc finished the week ended 14 June, three percentage points behind the five-year average. Plantings in Kansas were 57pc complete, down from the 85pc average, while Missouri had planted 42pc of its soybeans, down from the 79pc average. This year's Missouri soybean plantings are at the slowest rate since 1995. Rain over the last 30 days has been particularly heavy in both states with areas in east Kansas and northwest Missouri receiving more than 12 inches during that span, according to the National Weather Service. All other 16 of the top 18 producing states are within at least two percentage points of the average.
Soybeans were 75pc emerged the week ended 14 June, two percentage points behind the five-year average, again pulled down by Kansas (30pc) and Missouri (28pc). Soybean condi- tions were in line with historical data, however, with 67pc of the crop rated good or excellent.
Winter wheat conditions were not as strong, with 22pc of the crop rated poor and very poor, up from 20pc the previ- ous week. Good and excellent ratings were in line with the previous week at 43pc.
Harvested winter wheat lagged behind the five-year average for the second straight week. Overall winter wheat was 11pc harvested, down nine percentage points from the average.
Oklahoma (38pc) and Arkansas (39pc), which had both seen heavy storms through the end of May and early June, were 19pc and 17pc behind their respective harvesting averages.
Spring wheat condition was rated 70pc good and excellent, unchanged from the previous week, with only 4pc of the crop rated poor and very poor.
The number of days suitable for fieldwork was mixed the week ended 14 June, especially in the Corn Belt. Illinois (2.3), Indiana (3.2) and Iowa (3.2) all saw less days week- over-week for fieldwork, while Kansas (4.4) Kentucky (5.8) and Missouri (3) showed improvement.
Overall corn progress held steady the week ended 14 June, with plantings two percentage points above the average at 97pc. Corn condition was also flat to the previous week at 73pc rated good and excellent.
Plantings for cotton and sorghum still lagged behind for the five-year averages. Overall cotton plantings were 91pc completed, down from the 96pc average, while sorghum was 71pc planted, behind its 80pc average.
CME declares force majeure on corn, soy
CME Group declared force majeure for corn and soybean shipments because of high-water conditions on the Illinois river, preventing barge loadings. The area has seen recent heavy rains, which has made barge loading and movement difficult. CME said a majority of corn and soybean loading facilities are located along the Illinois river.
California curtails water use for farmers
Regulators cut water supply to California's largest agricul- tural areas last week, the latest step in the state's efforts to curtail water use during a historic drought.
The State Water Resources Control Board announced 12 June that there is insufficient water to supply senior water right holders in the San Joaquin and Sacramento areas.
California's water rights are based on seniority. When the water system becomes insufficient to supply all right hold- ers, those with junior rights are forced to stop using water to accommodate senior users.
"Some water right holders may have other, more senior rights to fall back on, or have water stored in reservoirs that they can still access," the board said. "If that's not available they will have to find other sources of water, such as ground- water or purchased water, if available."
Overall, 114 rights holder will be affected, including 86 along the Sacramento river, impacting the use for irrigation, stockwatering and livestock. The state first implemented water restriction in April, though those rules focused more on residential use and did not impact agriculture.
California had the highest revenue from agricultural pro- duction in the US in 2013 with $46.4bn, $15.2bn more than the next highest state, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The state will produce 1.9bn pounds of almonds in 2015, down just 1pc from 2014 despite the ongoing drought, ac- cording to the USDA. Area that will produce almonds is pro- jected to reach a record 890,000 acres, up 2.2pc from 2014, with a yield of 2,080 pounds/acre. One acre of almonds uses an estimated 250lbs of nitrogen, according to the University

of California, Davis. Comparatively, one acre of corn uses up to 180lbs of nitrogen. One acre of almonds also uses 150lbs of potash, 2-5lbs of boron and 10-15lbs of zinc.
Plantings for principal field crops – including corn, wheat and soybean – in the state are all in line with the historical five- year averages, and crop conditions are rated at least 85pc good to excellent, according to the USDA.
