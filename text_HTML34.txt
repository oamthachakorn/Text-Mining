Sulphuric acid: Asian prices slip lower
Prices east of Suez slipped lower this week, on weaker fun- damentals and bearish sentiment.
Price pressure in China intensified this week ahead of Lunar holidays and export prices dropped lower to $23-27/t fob. Prices moved in line with domestic markets, which sank lower as producers raced to reduce inventory levels ahead of the anticipated two week lull. Sulphur prices remain in freefall, with scant buying on the horizon to offer support.
Indian cfr values were weighed on this week by offers reported in the mid-to-high $20s/t. High fertilizer stocks persist and buyers are eyeing cheaper priced acid. Offers for April deliveries into India were reported in the mid-to- high $20s/t, and possible spot trade added weight to already depressed cfr values.
* Indicative price/No recent business
South Korea/Japan fob prices tracked Indian cfr values lower this week, to be reported at a $0/t midpoint. Fob prices have been teetering on dropping below zero for several weeks, on weaker netbacks from Chinese contracts, weaker sentiment and a lack of upside potential.
A confirmed turnaround in March in the Philippines could also add further length to Japanese market, which may en- courage the country’s smelters to divert acid elsewhere.
Atlantic basin: hardly bullish
In Northwest Europe, looking specifically at the supply/ demand picture of sulphuric acid some market participants expect higher prices. But lack of outright trade has not yet moved prices. Supply is reportedly tight, evidenced in recent vessel movements.
But a strong dollar, falling commodity markets and an uncer- tain phosphates picture all continue to weigh on sentiment.

to the market, evidenced by a minor uptick in Brazilian cfr values. But this seems a risky bet to make.
US fertilizer producer Mosaic announced a signiﬁcant curtail- ment across its phosphate production this week. And if a similar move is replicated in Morocco, the impact on Atlantic basin sulphuric acid pricing could be severe.

Fundamentals
Supply - Metals and Ores
The oversupply in the global nickel market is not show- ing any serious signs of abating despite expectations of shortages caused by Indonesia’s nickel ore export ban and forecasts that the a 40pc price decline in 2015 would cause a spate of mine closures. Nickel prices declined the most of all base metals over the course of last year, down to below $9,000/t, feeding expectations that producers would announce large output cuts because as estimates that at those price levels more than a half of global producers were unproﬁtable.
But these estimates were based on much higher oil prices and a different picture in terms of currencies. As oil prices dropped to around $30/bbl so did key production costs such as transport and electricity. Similarly, the weakening of commodity currencies like the ruble, rand and the Austra- lian dollar has worked in favour of producers and helped them to cut costs rather than output.
Although there has been a number of mine and smelter closures over the last 12 months these were mainly smaller and less proﬁtable operations. Recent examples include Panoramic Resources which is in the process of placing its
Savanah mine in Western Australia on care and maintenance and Glencore which is considering shutting down its Murrin Murrin mine in Western Australia. But a number of the lat- est production decisions were not based on simple eco- nomic maths but on labour and social issues. For instance, instead of closing down its Manitoba smelting and reﬁning in 2015 as initially planned, Brazilian miner Vale decided to extended the operations there until 2018.
Similarly, the Finnish state decided to resurrect the bankrupt Talvivaara Sotkamo nickel mine and restart pro- duction in order to preserve jobs and have access to nickel.
The most proﬁtable producers are keeping their production levels steady, notably the world’s two largest nickel makers,
Russia’s Norilsk Nickel and Brazil’s Vale.
As long as the expected mine and smelter closures are not materialising there is not likely to be a shortage of the metal on the global market – London Metal Exchange ware- house stocks are still at around 450,000t - and there is little incentive for nickel prices to move higher.

Global demand is not likely to change this picture. All the economic signals from China point to lower usage in the year ahead, particularly from the infrastructure and transport sectors, the two main end users of the metal. De- mand elsewhere like the US and other emerging markets is increasing but at a fairly slow pace while demand in Europe and Japan remains stagnant. While this persists nickel pric- es are likely to remain in a range, capped on the one hand by excess supply and supported on the other by production costs which will not allow for a much larger price decline.
Supply - Sulphur
Reductions in Middle East monthly prices were widely anticipated, yet the decrease of $17/t for the Official Selling Price (OSP) by UAE’s Adnoc and the $30/t cut by Tasweeq in its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) shocked the market for different reasons. While both producers acknowledged the decline in demand resulted from a slowing phosphates mar- ket, some considered the OSP too high, though it is thought to reflect Adnoc’s comfortable position. Tasweeq’s decision baffled some as it is over $10/t lower than the most recent spot sale in the Middle East for 2H February loading, con- cluded at around $100/t fob.
Sulphuric acid this week
The price gap between the three monthly lifting prices is now wide at $26/t - a clear reflection of a weakening mar- ket. There is a lack of demand for sulphur, which has led to prices falling day by day in some regions. In the Mediter- ranean, one trader said “you have a price one day, it’s gone the next.”
The Chinese New Year holiday beginning later this week marks the start of two weeks of negligible demand in the 11.9mn t import market. The latest granular deals took place between the $90s/t and low-$100s/t cfr China as traders begin to liquidate, with spot crushed lump business concluded in the mid-$80s/t cfr. Molten sulphur trades have also moved down to the $80s/t cfr.
Demand - Leaching and Industrial
Copper prices climbed to $4,605.50/t on 2 February, up $98/t on the week, but slipped back down to $4,578.50/t by the close. While prices have ticked up on the whole, market sentiment has been gloomy as Chinese spot prices continue to sit at multi-year lows on oversupply economic slowdown. Three-month futures ticked up in a similar fashion to cash prices, with a high of $4,601/t reached on 2 February, but prices slipped down to $4,580.50 on 3 February.

Global sulphuric acid shutdowns/curtailments
Nickel prices have taken a dive this week dropping $215/t to settle at $8,440/t on 3 February. Prices continue to fall as despite a series of production cuts from smaller compa- nies, the picture across the industry is that of oversupply.
Traders noted this year is already proving difﬁcult and little business is being booked. Three-month futures lost $235/t on the week to sit at $8,465/t.
Zinc prices gained $86/t this week, to sit at $1,683.50/t at week end. Prices have been moving up over the last few weeks on a combination of speculative trading and produc- tion cut news. Futures prices also moved up by $84/t to sit at $1,679/t on 3 February, this has been attributed to inves-
tors becoming heavily involved with spreading as they cover old short positions and move to open new shorts.

Demand - Fertilizers and Agriculture
The market is to some extent still reeling from the signifi- cant price falls seen last week which wiped 10pc off the cfr values in Latin America. Latin American prices have contin- ued to fall (although by much less this week) as traders sell remaining lots from January vessels. India is full of product and southeast Asian demand is lacklustre.
With DAP/MAP prices plummeting in Latin America, it came as little surprise that a supply side response would ensue. Mosaic has taken the lead by announcing it will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. Assuming these cuts are fully realised, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic's quar- terly finished phosphate production capacity. The likely re- sponse will be a reaction in the domestic price, but Mosaic faces a delicate balancing act. On the one hand it wants to shore up the price for phosphates, but on the other it wants to protect domestic market share. Cutting production runs the risk of encouraging more DAP/MAP imports from Russia and Morocco. Mosaic will thus doubtless be hoping other producers follow suit. But the question is who will follow Mosaic's lead? The US is not the global phosphates super- power it once was, its mantle taken by Morocco and China, so this announcement in itself will not be enough to balance the market.
Fundamentally there is no demand of note anywhere in the world. This situation will continue for at least three weeks, and possibly longer until more Latin American de- mand emerges, the US domestic season gets underway and we have a better idea of how the Chinese domestic market is shaping up. In the meantime, producers will hope that the supply side curtailments do the trick.
South America
Brazil
Brazilian cfr prices narrowed this week to be assessed in the $42-48/t cfr range, after finding support from fresh trade and reportedly tighter supply.
Some market participants pegged value at the upper end of the range, while recent trade out of Ilo, Peru confirmed the low end.
Some market participants attributed a firming in sentiment to increased spot appetite in Argentina, which has absorbed
additional European material. Agribusiness giant Bunge has taken around one full size cargo a month since mid-Q4 last year, two of which have come from European suppliers.
Meanwhile, the Songa Challenge loaded in Ilo, Peru last week, with 19,000t for delivery to Rio Grande, via a trader, reportedly against Yara’s latest interest. The acid was purchased on a fob basis in the $10-15/t range, putting the cfr Brazil value in the low $40s/t, assuming freight Ilo-Rio Grande in the low $30s/t
And the Fairchem Maverick ex-Huelva will take 18,500t to Rio Grande also. Price ideas attached to the business were in the mid $40s/t cfr. Both Yara and Timac recieve acid in Rio Grande.
Argentina
Agribusiness giant Bunge is poised to take receipt of the Bunga Lotus ex-Guaymas, Mexico later this month. The 19,000t vessel has 15-20 February laycan and has been fixed on a Guaymas-Quebracho basis in the mid-$60s/t.
The vessel marks the latest in a spate of buying from Bunge, which has helped to tighten the market. Some market par- ticipants have attributed this to a slight firming in European acid market sentiment.
The Chem Singapore ex-Huelva, Spain loaded at the end of November 2015 for delivery to Ramallo, via a trader. The following month, Aurubis sold an 18,000t spot vessel ex- Hamburg to the same buyer, also via a trader.
Peru
The Songa Challenge loaded in Ilo last week, with 19,000t for delivery to Rio Grande, Brazil, via a trader.
The vessel is scheduled to arrive in Rio Grande on 10 Febru- ary.
Freight on an Ilo-Rio Grande basis was assessed in the low $30s/t, coupled with a fob price in the $10-15/t range, put cfr Brazil values in the low $40s/t.
Southern Copper eyes Tia Maria mine approval
Southern Copper expects to be granted permission to build its $1.4bn sulphuric acid consuming Tia Maria copper mine in Peru, according to the government's official news agency.
Although Southern Copper has received final approval of the Tia Maria Environmental Impact Assessment, the issuance
Licensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP
of a construction permit has been delayed by a series of protests by community groups in Peru's southern Arequipa region that have resulted in fatalities.
Opposition groups say the 120,000t/yr copper mine develop- ment would pollute agricultural land in local valleys. But the company says its investments in the project are already benefiting residents, farmers and ranchers to the tune of about $28mn.
The project, with an expected mine life of 20 years, will take around two years to build before moving into produc- tion, allowing time for copper prices to recover after the recent sharp declines in copper prices, company executives say. The project would use solvent-extraction electro-win- ning (SX-EW) technology, which will consume around 700,000 t/yr of sulphuric acid.
Copper spot prices on the London Metals Exchange (LME) have fallen by nearly 20pc to $4,578/t from $5,695/t on 3 February in 2015, as demand for commodities around the world has waned as a result of China's economic slowdown.
In the first nine months of 2015 Southern Copper, part of Mexico-based Grupo Mexico, produced 536,593t of copper and 17,354t of molybdenum from mines in Mexico and Peru.
Mexico
Pemex acquires Mexican phosphate producer Fertinal
Mexican phosphate producer Fertinal confirmed that it has been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes, a subsidiary of the state-owned company.
"Today is time for a change of control, we confirm that Fertinal has officially been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes," Fertinal said in a letter to stakeholders and customers. "This acquisition will bring new opportunities for Fertinal due to the vertical integration of this Group in the chain production of gas–ammonia–fertilizer; this will allow Grupo Fertinal to become a low cost producer and a stronger competitor."
The acquisition has been made official after Pemex reached an agreement to take over Fertinal in December.
Fertinal, Mexico's lone phosphate producer, had endured cash flow issues over the past two years because of a series of operational setbacks, combined with falling global phos- phate prices. The company's phosphate rock mine in Baja California Sur, Mexico, was impacted by a hurricane and a fire in late 2014, which decreased production.
Fertinal sale may impact sulphur and sulphuric acid pro- curement
Mexican fertilizer producer Fertinal is a consumer of sulphur and sulphuric acid for the production of phosphate fertil- izers. The firm intends to build "business relationships with current clients, contractors and suppliers", according to a recent statement, indicating its procurement methods may not change substantially in the near term.
The firm imported around 445,000t of sulphur, and 180,000- 185,000t of sulphuric acid via the port of Lazaro Cardenas last year. Most of its sulphur and sulphuric acid procurement in the past has been conducted via traders, on a spot basis.
Sulphur is produced locally in Mexico from natural gas processing and oil refining, and all refineries in Mexico are owned by Pemex. At present, the only outlets for Pemex's sulphur production are the domestic market, or the move- ment of molten sulphur by vessel to the US for two key fertilizer producers: Mosaic and PotashCorp.
Logistical constraints have prevented Fertinal from receiv- ing significant quantities of sulphur from Pemex in the past. And while it makes sense for Fertinal to be self-sufficient with Pemex's sulphur in the future, investments are needed to improve transportation to and from the Fertinal units and within Mexico.
If this happens, domestic trade flow may change and it may have a knock-on effect on the utilisation of Mexico's first sul- phur forming capacity, which is expected to come on stream in the first half of 2016, with capacity of 360,000t/yr.
The forming unit is located at Coatzacoalcos in south Mexico on the Atlantic coast and is also owned by Pemex. Its start up should allow sulphur production unconsumed by the local market to move offshore. But its utilisation is subject to change, depending on Fertinal's future sulphur procurement strategy.
As for sulphuric acid, Fertinal produces sulphur-based acid and augments its requirements with imports. The cargoes typically come from the Far East, delivered via tankers and combo vessels, which are capable of transporting acid from Japan/South Korea to Latin America and copper concentrate on return voyages.
Logistical disadvantages again have so far made it cheaper for Fertinal to import acid, rather than receive domestic product via tanker trucks.

With the acquisition, it remains to be seen if a partnership is could be established with local smelter acid producer South- ern Copper/Grupo Mexico. The company operates two mines that both produce smelter acid in Mexico — La Caridad in Nacozari and Buenavista in Cananea, both located in Sonora.
Another potential partnership could be with El Boleo, in Baja California Sur state in southern Mexico, a copper producer that was expected to export an estimated 200,000t of sulphur-based sulphuric acid via the port of Santa Rosalia last year. But given Mexico exported 225,000t and 140,000t of sulphuric acid to Chile and Brazil in January-October 2015, respectively, last year’s export figure appears likely to significantly surpass original estimates
Meanwhile, Fertinal is estimated to be covered with sulphur and sulphuric acid until around March.
North America
US
The North American market remained flat this week, with dampened demand keeping prices relatively static in the $39-45/t cfr range.
In the US, the market remains well supplied by contractual volumes and domestic oversupply. Both factors continue to limit the need for import tonnage.
Bearish sentiment was augmented this week by news the leading US fertilizer producer Mosaic will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t, with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. The reduction is unlikely to impact US vessel import prices, given the producer is mostly self-sufficient for its acid needs.
Africa and Mediterranean
Morocco
North African cfr prices were assessed flat at $15-25/t cfr week-on-week, following the conclusion of a deal in the middle of that range last week.
Questions over Moroccan phosphates producer OCP’s sulph- uric acid consumption levels were again raised, following the inauguration of the firm’s Africa Fertilizer complex earlier this week.

Ideas surrounding the producer’s sulphuric acid demand remain in flux, amid the ongoing backdrop of a weakening phosphates market.
OCP’s Africa Fertilizer Complex inaugurated
Africa Fertilizer Complex, part of OCP’s Jorf Lasfar phos- phate-production facility in Morocco was inaugurated on 1 February.
The plant will solely supply fertilizers to African markets. It has a nameplate capacity of 1.4mn t/yr of sulphuric acid, 450,000t of phosphoric acid and 1mn t of DAP/MAP/NPKs. The plant is currently running at full capacity a source at OCP said. The fertilizer complex was built at a cost of 5.3bn dirham ($0.5bn).
Jorf Lasfar is planned as a phosphate production hub, part of OCP’s expansion plan which is split in two phases. Con- struction of the first phase took from 2013 through to July 2015 and added a capacity of 4mn t/yr of DAP/MAP.
Namibia
Rio Tinto has reportedly purchased a spot cargo on an ex-Philippines basis for Walvis Bay. Price ideas could not be confirmed at press time, but freight on the route was as- sessed in the high $40s/t.
Rio Tinto buys acid for Rossing Uranium, which is normally supplied with sulphuric acid produced by domestic smelter Tsumeb, operated by Canada's Dundee Precious Metals (DPM).
Since the ramp up of the Tsumeb smelter, Rossing’s require- ments for offshore acid supplied though Walvis Bay have slackened.
Fresh exports indicate Tsumeb may not be operating at full capacity, despite DPM confirming smelting rates “were in line with 2015 guidance” last month.
The second phase of expansion will begin in 2020 with six proposed DAP/MAP units to be built, adding another 6mn t/ year capacity. This will make OCP the largest single phos- phates producer in the world.
Europe
Northwest Europe
Northwest European fob prices found a degree of support this week from firmer netbacks on the back of recently con- cluded business into Brazil.
A sale on an ex-Huelva basis — reportedly concluded in the

mid $40s/t cfr — netted back to $0-5/t fob Spain. Applying slightly higher freight on northwest Europe-Brazil at $40- 42/t, fob northwest Europe netbacks sat in the middle of the prevailing $0-9/t fob range.
Market participants see upside potential in sulphuric acid fob prices, with some producers calling a bottom and pre- dicting price increases in the front quarter. Possible increas- es have been attributed to the market tightening driven by planned turnarounds. And further turnarounds were an- nounced this week by Belgian zinc producer Nyrstar.
But in narrowing the view to specific supply/demand picture for sulphuric acid, an expectation of higher prices might be overstated. Outright trade is what moves prices and senti- ment amongst traders remains gloomy.
vember's 96,000t — a 24-month low. But month-on-month increases did little to assuage a sharp quarterly fall of 43pc. Fourth-quarter exports of 448,000t, compared with quar- terly averages of 755,000t in the previous three quarters.
Losses in October-December can be attributed to an unplanned outage in September at Tokyo-based Pan Pa- cific Copper's Tamano smelter, located in Japan's southern Okayama prefecture, which halted 2,000t/d of production for 42 days.
The same firm's 120,000 t/month Saganoseki smelter entered 55 days of planned maintenance the following month. And
a 25-day outage at Sumitomo Metal Mining's Toyo copper smelter in Niihama, Ehime prefecture in November resulted in 90,000-100,000t of lost output.
Nyrstar 2016 planned shutdowns
Although the overall dip in exports was relatively slight, regional export fluctuations were more pronounced.
Export losses within Latin America, predominantly Chile, were much sharper at 23pc year on year.
Asia
South Korea / Japan
South Korean/Japanese fob prices succumbed to downward pressure on Thursday, assessed lower at a midpoint of $0/t fob.
Prices reamin under pressure from weaker Indian netbacks, on the back of unconfirmed trade and offers for April de- liveries reported in the mid-$20s/t cfr. Freight on a South Korea/Japan-India basis continues to be assessed in the $27- 29/t range, putting fob prices in the minue $5 to $0/t range.
Japan’s sulacid exports drop in 2015
Japan's sulphuric acid exports fell by 4pc year on year in 2015 to 2.7mn t, as planned and unplanned production out- ages weighed on exports in the fourth quarter, customs data show.
Exports in December of 155,000t were up by 62pc on No-
Sulphuric acid supplies to more ancillary export regions moved in different directions. Northeast Asian importers received 153,000t, a decrease of 44pc year on year, while

buyers in Australasia took receipt of 119,000t, an increase of 60pc, in the same period.
China
Fob prices in China shed value this week, slipping lower on the week, to settle at $23-27/t, as the pace quickened to reduce inventory ahead of Lunar holidays. The national holi- day signals negligible demand in the 1H February for both sulphur and sulphuric acid.
Around Zhangjiagang, where Two Lions Fine Chemicals is located, the producer reduced the top end of its exw price range by Yn20/t on the week, settling at Yn150-180/t exw this week. The equivalent dollar price was $23-27/t, at the close.
Export fob prices could come under further pressure by repeat offers from Guangxi Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals. The producer has also slashed its exw sulphuric acid price to Yn20/t, equivalent to $3/t fob at the close.
A sale on an ex-Fancheng basis for prompt delivery to Paradeep, India was reported this week. A trader fixed the Pacific Stream at an unconfirmed price level, at an uncon- firmed price level. Freight on a Fancheng-Paradeep basis was estimated in the low-to-mid $20s/t.
Whilst it remains unclear if traders marketing Jinchuan product can make sufficient margins at current price levels, lower priced acid signals greater competition on the horizon for China’s main exporter — Two Lions Fine Chemical. Jinch- uan acid could also offer logistical advantages, in terms of freight, over Two Lions material, dependent on destination.
Philippines
A vessel has been fixed on an ex-Isabel basis for Walvis Bay for Rossing Uranium. Freight on an Isabel-Walvis Bay basis was reported in the high-$40s/t.
Further freight enquiries were reported ex-Isabel for China
—possibly for Longkou in Shandong province — with uncon- firmed reports mooted a shipment may have been be fixed in the mid-$10s/t cfr.
Sumitomo’s Taganito nickel plant plans turnaround
Japanese mining company Sumitomo Metal Mining's Taganito nickel plant in the Philippines has scheduled a planned two- week turnaround in the first half of March.
The 14-day turnaround will result in a surplus of around
37,000t of acid, assuming a consumption rate of 73,000 t/ month.
Regular suppliers to the Philippines will likely need to divert acid destined for Taganito, which could result in spot move- ments. The Philippines relies predominantly on Japan for its sulphuric acid import needs.
Argus assessed the South Korea/Japan spot fob price at $0- 5/t last week, but there are indications this week that spot trade may have occurred at negative values, which could pressure fob assessments lower.
Japan supplied 1.3mnt to the Philippines last year, equiva- lent to 46pc of its total exports, customs data show.
India
In India, prices softened on the week to settle at a $25/t cfr midpoint. Offers for April deliveries were reported in the mid-to-high $20s/t cfr, weighing on assessments. Uncon- firmed reports suggested prompt trade had occurred in the mid-$20s/t cfr.
Meanwhile, an Indian buyer is poised to take receipt of acid on an ex-Fancheng basis, at an unconfirmed price level. The Pacific Stream is sailing to Paradeep for fertilizer producer Paradeep Phosphates later this month.
Q1 DAP imports limited
Argus FMB understands that the Indian Department of Fertil- izers (DoF) has stopped the movement of imported DAP, NPK and MOP during February-March 2016. No formal notification has been issued, however.
The consequence is that DAP and MOP lying at the ports or warehouses in the country cannot be sold and transported into the interior.
DAP stocks are estimated at around 60,000t in various ports.
It is further reported that the DoF will monitor the move- ment of domestic production. This will effectively reduce import demand for DAP, NPK and MOP to nil till end March.
Unsold stock of imported DAP, MOP and NPK lying at ports and warehouses will be subject to the new (likely reduced) subsidy which will be announced in early Q2 for the 2016-17 fertilizer year.

BHP Billiton unit imports nickel concentrate
UK-Australian resources group BHP Billiton has imported nickel concentrate for its vertically integrated Nickel West operation in Western Australia, and the firm intends to import more after a spate of regional mid-tier nickel mine cutbacks and closures.
BHP Billiton, like many nickel producers, is "feeling the pres- sure" of persistently low nickel prices, it said. Three-month nickel futures settled at $8,525/t yesterday, down by 42pc on the year.
Nickel West comprises the Kwinana refinery, the Kalgoorlie smelter, Kambalda concentrator, and nickel mines at Mount Keith and Leinster.
The sulphuric acid-producing smelter works in conjunction with the nearby concentrator, which is fed ore from the firm's mines and third parties. The Kambalda mill has been operating at a reduced rate — in line with reduced ore deliv- eries — since last year, BHP Billiton said. The smelter has an estimated nameplate sulphuric acid production capacity of around 800,000 t/yr, although the firm would not reveal the exact operating rate. Dwindling ore supplies from third-party suppliers is leading to increased imports.
Sydney-listed nickel mining firm Mincor Resources suspended production at its Miitel and Mariners nickel mines last week until nickel prices recover. The firm indicated in September that it might suspend output, if prices did not strengthen.
Another Australian nickel producer, Panoramic Resources, suspended operations at two nickel sulphide mines in West- ern Australia — Savannah in east Kimberley and Lanfranchi near Kambalda —in January this year and November 2015, respectively.
BHP Billiton restarted mining at the Rocky's Reward nickel mine near Leinster, to help mitigate the loss of third-party

supply. "This is progressing well with production ramping up," the firm said. BHP Billiton has plans to fully develop the Leinster 1A nickel resource.
BHP Billiton's nickel output fell by 23pc to 37,300t at Nickel West in the six months to 31 December because of main- tenance shutdowns at the Kalgoorlie smelter and Kwinana refinery.
Papua New Guinea
Ramu PNG nickel project increases output
Australian resource company Highlands Pacific, operator of the Ramu nickel project in Papua New Guinea, increased nickel concentrate production at the site by 25pc last year to 25,582t.
Output for 2016 is “expected to grow strongly” on increased throughput — exceeding 29,000t of nickel — with nameplate capacity of 31,150t achieved by the end of the year, the company said.
Production in the fourth quarter was slightly lower than the prior quarter at 6,320t because of a 20-day maintenance shutdown in November.
The progressive ramp-up of the project has heralded the slackening of Papua New Guinea’s imported sulphuric acid requirements, as the operation includes a 3,350 t/day sulph- uric acid plant to support nickel leaching.
The acid plant receives 360,000 t/yr of sulphur supplied to the site by bulk carriers. The firm floated a sulphur purchase tender last November, requesting 280,000t to be shipped in eight vessels, beginning April this year.
Three-month nickel futures settled at $8,585/t on 29 Janu- ary, down by 42pc on the year. Depressed nickel prices have impacted the Ramu operation, the firm said.

China copper profits hit by weaker yuan
China’s leading copper smelters are expecting a significant fall in profit in 2015 from a year earlier, amid price falls and a weaker yuan.
Jiangxi Copper said in its official forecast that profits would fall by 60-80pc in 2015 from Yn2.85bn ($434mn) a year

earlier.
Profits fell sharply last year because of lower prices for its main products copper and gold, amid a global downturn on commodity markets.
Tongling Nonferrous has forecast a loss of Yn620-670mn in 2015, compared with profit of Yn3bn a year earlier.
The Anhui-based company attributes the losses to falling prices of its main products, particularly copper, and the depreciation of the yuan.
But Tongling Nonferrous is still “confident” about its perfor- mance in the next five years as it expects to achieve a profit of Yn5bn by 2020.
Chinese spot copper prices have declined to a multi-year low because of oversupply and the country’s slower economic growth which has hit infrastructure construction.
China’s ten leading copper smelters, including Jiangxi Cop- per and Tongling Nonferrous, have agreed to cut refined copper output by 350,000t in 2016.
Shrieve Chemical names new CEO
Ted Threadgill has been appointed president and chief executive of Shrieve Chemical Company by the board of directors, the company said today.
Threadgill has been with the company since 1994 and estab- lished the Jacksonville, Florida, sulphuric acid terminal in 2002. He most recently managed Shrieve’s southeast region. Jerry Jackson has stepped down as president after a two- year transition and will become the executive vice president and chairman of the board. Jackson is a 40-year veteran of the fertilizer and chemical industries.
Chris Burns will take over the southeast region for Thread- gill.
PhosAgro calls 2015 ‘challenging’
Russian fertilizer producer PhosAgro called 2015 a "challeng- ing" year as it posted a dip in sales of most products, barring phosphate-based fertilizers.
Urea sales fell by 6.6pc to 949,400t from 1.01mn t in 2014. NP sales fell to nil from 120,300t in 2014.
Ammonia-based fertilizer sales fell by 82.2pc to 6,100t; phosphoric acid sales fell by 20.3pc to 41,100t, while sulph-
uric acid sales dropped by 81.8pc to 19,600t.
Only phosphate-based fertilizer showed growth — DAP/MAP and NPK sales rose by 11.6pc and 11.8pc to 2.6mn t and 1.9mn t, respectively, during the period. Overall fertilizer sales for the year rose by 9pc to 6.6mn t.
“2015 was another challenging year in terms of the mac- roeconomic environment. With prices for all commodities declining, it comes as no surprise that fertilizer prices followed the same trend,” PhosAgro chief executive Andrey Guryev said.
PhosAgro’s annual sales to Europe grew by 30pc to 1.25mn t, while sales to India rose to 700,000t. Latin American market performance was weaker as a result of low soybean prices and economic challenges in the region, the company said.
On the production side, PhosAgro produced 11.7pc more DAP/MAP at 2.6mn t. NPKs production in 2015 rose by 11.4pc to 1.9mn t. Urea production was up by 1.3pc to 978,100t; and SOP and sulphuric acid production gained 23.6pc and 5.6pc to 36,700t and 4.7mn t, respectively.
“Throughout 2015, PhosAgro continued to invest in the mod- ernisation of its production facilities and to implement other cost-cutting initiatives… we managed to increase our produc- tion of fertilizers by 10pc year on year, and by the end of 2015 our annual fertilizer production capacity reached 7mn t,” Guryev said.
Nyrstar zinc, sulphuric acid output rises in 2015
Belgian zinc and minor metals producer Nyrstar's output of sulphuric acid in 2015 increased by 1pc year on year to 1.45mn t across its global portfolio, while zinc production climbed by 2pc to 1.1mn t.
Nyrstar realised an average global price of $39/t for acid in the second half of 2015, down by 13pc from the first half. Lower prices were driven by “weakening global sulphur prices”, a weaker euro against the US dollar and indications of a weakening in the world economy during the second half of 2015, the company said.
Germany-based Aurubis, Europe's largest copper smelter, attributed similar weak fundamentals to an "unfavourable" situation for sulphuric acid prices.
Nyrstar had stable euro prices of sulphuric acid within northwest European markets, but stability was “negatively

impacted by the weakening of the euro against the US dol- lar”, the firm said.
Argus assessed smelter acid contract prices within northwest Europe at €53-70/t ($59-78/t) cfr in the second half of 2015, flat compared with the first half of the year.
Nyrstar's zinc production at Auby, France, was down by 1pc on the year at 169,000t. Output from Balen, Belgium, fell by 1pc to 260,000t. Budel in the Netherlands produced 291,000t, flat compared with 2014. Production at the firm’s Clarksville plant in the US increased by 13pc to 124,000t. Its Hobart, Australia, operations produced 271,000t, up by 8pc. The average achieved zinc price throughout 2015 was $1,928/t, down by 11pc from 2014.
Nyrstar attributed the increase in production across the year to fewer planned maintenance shutdowns as well as the improved availability and utilisation of roasting, leaching and cell-house processes. But a number of scheduled mainte- nance shutdowns at smelters this year may negatively impact both zinc and sulphuric acid output.
Nyrstar completed all major engineering work at its Port Pirie smelter redevelopment in Australia, paving the way for a full ramp-up to commence in the second half of the year, the company said.
It remains unclear what level sulphuric acid production will be at following the ramp-up, but a possible surplus of around 200,000t may need to be exported from Adelaide to balance the market, market participants said.
Increased output from Port Pirie could be absorbed in the Australian market if the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter has less supply. But the smelter, which provides sulphuric acid to Australian fertilizer and chemical company Incitec Pivot's Phosphate Hill plant, had its life span extended last Novem- ber to the end of 2022 from the end of this year.
Nyrstar's metals segment posted 2015 earnings before inter- est, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of €336mn, an increase of €96mn from 2014.
