Argus FMB Sulphuric Acid
Issue 15-22 | Thursday 4 June 2015
Market summary
Market shows stability
The acid market is stable. One deal this week is Petro- bras’ tender for 15,000t, which is understood to have been awarded to a trader sourcing acid from NW Europe. It will leave Antwerp, Belgium on 1-5 July for arrival in Barra dos Coqueiros, Brazil in late July. Prices have been heard at around $85/t cfr.
Meanwhile in Asia, 100,000t were sold to traders for delivery in the second half of the year, as reported last week. The acid will be sourced from two separate Far East Asian smelt- er acid producers. The price on the cargoes is understood to be in the range of $30-32/t fob.
Producers in East Asia and NW Europe now talk of being sold out for the near future, while receiving little to no spot en- quiries. Low demand, coupled with limited spot availability, resulted in price stability as seen in recent weeks. Traders as a result appear unwilling to pay over $30/t fob for Far Eastern smelter acid; producers in NW Europe appear unwill- ing to sell below $40/t fob.
On the demand side, most of the regular channels of de- mand are quieting down. OCP in Morocco is understood to be covered, as are most consumers in Brazil. Most buyers in India, with the exception of Coromandel, are also under- stood to be moving away from the market. The US market remains steady.
The talking point now is the future of Asian supply and demand moving into 2H 2015. The return of PASAR acid to the market will coincide with turnarounds at Saganoseki and Niihama smelters in Japan. As a result, market participants are operating on a wait-and-see basis as the forecast is unclear at present.
Outlook: Lack of demand is halting upward price move- ment.

Highlights this week
15,000t will be shipped out of Antwerp, Belgium via a trader on the AS Olivia to Barra dos Coqueiros, Brazil, loading 1-5 July. The buyer is Petrobras, prices heard in the mid/high-$80s/t cfr.
Two Lions is understood to have recently sold another cargo
from the market leading to demand destruction. Recent spot deals for June loading in the Middle East have steadily moved up and have mostly been concluded in the range of $143-148/t fob, and offers into China have subsequently moved up to $158-163/t cfr.
Outlook: Signs of interest in China, but it is not known how long this will last.
Demand - Leaching and industrial
Two Far East Asian smelter acid producers sold 100,000t to traders for 2H 2015 shipment. Prices have been heard between $30/t and low-$30s/t fob South Korea/Japan.
Fundamentals
Supply - Sulphur
Since late last week, there has been a pick up in activ- ity in key import market China and several other regions including India, Jordan and Senegal. The return of buyer interest is likely led by a stable-to-firm P2O5 market.
Copper prices continued their downward movement this week after a difficult month in May. The metal settled at $5,992/t on 3 June, the first time its value has dropped be- low $6,000t since mid-April. The US dollar declined against six other major currencies, leading to a drop in value for many commodities including copper, nickel and zinc.
Nickel has also had a difficult month but levelled out somewhat this week after a sharp drop in mid-May. The metal has been affected by US economic data, but also by a lack of global demand. It settled on 3 June at $12,940/t, an

increase on last week's value of $12,625/t on 27 May.
Zinc's decline in May was less dramatic than nickel or
copper, but still saw mostly downward movement. The
metal settled on 3 June at $2,157/t, a two-month low.
In Latin America, OCP and traders with MAP positions have maintained prices around $500/t cfr, as indicated last
week. The volume placed by OCP – 240,000t for June – is high. The key focus in this region is the strength of demand
in Brazil. It is clear that Brazil still needs to buy but con- cerns over crop pricing and the Brazilian real could hamper this demand to an extent. In terms of pricing, suppliers ap- pear to be maintaining current levels around $500/t cfr.
Pakistan has also been active, with another Saudi DAP cargo placed into the market for June. Latest NFDC data
would appear to support the view that supplies will be
pretty thin for end kharif, necessitating additional imports in Q3.
Outlook: The market will be stable-to-firm through Q3
supported by continuing buying in Latin America and India.
Brazil – Petrobras’ will 
from NW Europe. The AS Olivia will load in
Antwerp, Belgium for shipment to Barra dos Coqueiros, Brazil in
late July.
India – The monsoon
Japan/South Korea – 100,000t worth of smelter acid were sold to traders from two different Far Eastern producers. The cargoes will be delivered in the second half of the year, and are heard to be in between $30/t and low- $30s/t fob Japan/Korea.

July, and the price has been heard in the mid/high-$80s/t cfr cfr. Petrobras closed this tender on 27 May. Petrobras' last completed business, which was a 15,000t tender closed on 9 April, was awarded to a trader in the high-$80s/t cfr Brazil for May arrival.
Elsewhere, copper company Paranapanema will report- edly be looking to import a cargo each month between now and the end of 3Q, because of unexpected problems at its smelter. The company also has a planned turnaround sched- uled for September, reportedly lasting one month.
Argentina
Argentinian fertilizer producer Bunge will receive 16,000t acid from NW Europe via a trader. The cargo is due to load onto the Bochem Antwerp in late June in Hamburg, Ger-
many, for shipment to Ramallo/Quebracho, Argentina. It is rumoured that this a vessel has been fixed close to $90/t cfr Ramallo/Quebracho, though further details are pending. Bunge is understood to be looking for another spot cargo of 15,000t for shipment during the first half of August.
Mexico
One of the two sulphuric acid plants operated by Mexican fertilizer producer Fertinal may undergo a refurbishment in the coming months. It has not yet been confirmed, but a decision is expected to be made by the end of June.
If the refurbishment goes ahead, the company will likely need to increase the number of cargoes it takes from offshore. Currently, Fertinal buys one to two cargoes per quarter, but it may need three or four should the plant halt

operation. The company will look to put the plant under maintenance during 4Q 2015, rather than 3Q, as phosphate sales are seasonally lower at the end of the year.
North America
US
The shutdown of PotashCorp’s (PCS) Geismar, Louisiana, sulphur-burning sulphuric acid plant, due to occur at the end of May, has been pushed back another month to the end of June. The reasons for this delay are not currently known. The closure of the plant will mean around 140,000 t/yr of smelter acid will be lost from the market. The drop off of tonnage may mean that PCS will look to the offshore spot market for tonnage.
Africa and Mediterranean
Morocco
Demand from Morocco is understood to be weak at present, as the company has begun acid production at its new sul- phur burner, part of a larger fertilizer plant that will supply DAP, MAP and NPKs to the African market. In 1Q, there was steady spot demand from fertilizer giant OCP in Morocco keeping producers comfortable in northwest Europe.
OCP will likely stockpile acid produced by its new plant for the coming weeks until the phosphoric acid and granulation plants begin operation. As a result, market players in Europe expect demand from OCP to drop further moving into 2H 2015. Between now and 2016, the company will build four new fertilizer plants, accompanied by sulphur burners.
Spain
A player in Spain suggests low availability may become an is- sue for contractual shipments. Sellers have spoken of receiv- ing continued spot enquiries for small lots of acid to North African countries (outside Morocco).
Europe
NW Europe
European producers have spoken of receiving no spot enqui- ries this week, with some producers suggesting that smelter acid supply may be loosening up a small amount.
The market in NW Europe has nevertheless remained stable, with market players suggesting no change to the prevailing fob NW Europe range of $30-37/t fob.
The AS Olivia will load 15,000t out of Antwerp, Belgium for shipment to Petrobras, arriving at Barra dos Coqueiros, Brazil in late July. The cargo will load 1-5 July, and is under- stood to have been sold to a trader in the mid/high0-$80s/t cfr Barra dos Coqueiros, which would give a NW Europe fob netback of around $35-40/t.
Bunge will receive 16,000t acid from Antwerp, Belgium via a trader on the Bochem Antwerp, loading in late June in Hamburg, Germany, for shipment to Ramallo/Quebracho, Argentina. It is rumoured that this vessel was fixed close to $90/t cfr Ramallo/Quebracho.
Boliden's Harjavalta smelter in Finland, which began a planned maintenance in mid-May, is understood to be partially running, and will return to full capacity within the coming few weeks. It is not known how much acid was lost, but the company is understood to have stockpiled in prepa- ration for contractual deliveries.
So2 emissions ruling has little effect six months on
On 1 January 2015, a ruling was put in place regarding sulphur emissions in shipping fuel in the Emission Control Area (ECA). The legislation stipulated that ships trading in the Area (NW Europe and oceanic waters surrounding the US) would be forced to use fuel oil with a sulphur content no higher than 0.1pc, down from the previous limit of 1pc used up to 31 December 2014. Marine Gas Oil and other similar products will instead be used for shipping due to their zero sulphur content and trace amounts of sulphur oxide emis- sions when ignited.
It had been suggested that a freight cost increase of 1.5-2pc would result, and some quoted increases as great as 10-15pc, which would have had a significant effect on the European commodities market.
Asia
China
Two Lions in China is understood to have sold eight cargoes in 2015. These are understood to have all gone to traders for shipment to India or southeast Asia, with the most recent completed deal due to load in late June for shipment to Kimaman, Malaysia.
Two Lions has said that it does not intend to export any more cargoes for the time being, as it expects demand from the Chinese domestic market to increase in the com- ing months. The company has also stated that its inventory

levels are currently low. Seller price target is in the range of $48-50/t fob Zhangjiagang.
In Henan Province, state-owned metal company China Metallurgical Group has opened a new 1.2mn t/yr capacity smelter. The smelter will supply the Chinese domestic mar- ket (so no impact on global trade), and will reportedly affect supply in Henan and Shandong provinces, where domestic prices have been heard at RMB 330-390/t ($53-63/t) exw for smelter acid.
Jinchuan Non-Ferrous Metals Corp is understood to have high stocks at its smelter in Gansu province, which produces around 180,000 t/yr acid. As a result of the high stocks, acid prices out of Jinchuan’s smelter have been heard at as low as RMB 190-230/t exw, almost half that of prices in Shandong Province. This smelter services on the domestic market.
In more international terms, buyers and sellers in the region will be re-entering contract negotiations for the third quar- ter of 2015 within the next two weeks, and local sources within China have stated that the outcome will likely be a decrease from the previous quarterly contract price of $27- 32/t cfr China, on low demand from buyers.
However, producers in Japan and Korea have seen tightness throughout 2015 so far, which has pushed spot prices up to $32/t fob Japan/Korea since the previous round of contract negotiations.
Japan/South Korea
As reported last week, a number of cargoes have been sold from two separate Far Eastern smelters to traders. Overall, 100,000t have been sold, for delivery in the second half of the year. The price on the cargoes is understood to be in the region of $30-32/t fob.
Players in the region do not forecast much upward price movement in the Far East, mainly because of the upcoming return of PASAR acid to the market. The PASAR smelter in the Philippines - owned by Glencore - will return to produc- tion in July, following a large-scale expansion to the plant's capacity. Ramping-up to the smelter's revised output of 1.1mn t/yr will likely not be completed until at least 4Q 2015.
However, market participants have also suggested that PASAR's return will again be balanced out by turnarounds at smelters in Japan, also in 4Q 2015. In October or November, a turnaround will start at PPC's Saganoseki smelter, which
will reportedly last around 40 days. The smelter produces around 120,000 t/month. In the same timeframe, Sumi- tomo's Niihama smelter will undergo a 20-day turnaround. Niihama also produces approximately 120,000 t/month. This will likely keep the acid market in Asia balanced, temporar- ily cancelling out the surplus brought back into the market by PASAR. As a result, producers and traders alike remain cautious to predict any price movement at present, and are taking a wait-and-see approach for the time being.
A freight fixture has been completed from Saganoseki to a trader. 19,000t is to be shipped to Map Ta Phut, Thailand, loading end June.
Another 19,000t will be shipped from Saganoseki to Paradeep, India, though a vessel has not been fixed yet. These are believed to be spot purchases.
India
PPL’s new sulphuric acid plant, which has seen numerous setbacks since construction began, is predicted to begin operation in the first half of August. The plant was originally due to open in December 2014.
Most buyers are believed to be covered, which has pushed bids down toward the low-$60s/t cfr. As a result of this - and the country’s current weather problems - demand is low at present. Coromandel is reported to still be in the spot mar- ket for 2H delivery of 80,000t.
It is understood that a cargo fixed for PPL was forced to be redirected following issues at PPL’s facility. The cargo, shipped on the vessel the Fairchem Steed, was understood to have been reverted to IFFCO. However, some local market sources have said that the cargo may have been diverted to the port of Kolkata, where it is currently stationary with no buyer.
Currently, the weather in India is causing growing concern amongst market participants. The monsoon season, which was due to start in Kerala on 1 June, has been delayed by 5 days, and is now expected to start on 5 June. Furthermore, the forecast has been revised; originally a 93pc monsoon was expected, but this has been lowered to 88pc. The India Meteorological Department’s guidelines state that a monsoon lower than 90pc is considered a drought year, and the delay to the monsoon has also prolonged the country’s current severe heatwave, which is halting industry including agriculture.
