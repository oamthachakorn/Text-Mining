Market summary
Prices edge up steadily, but can buying from China last?
Prices have edged up in China and the Middle East this week, following a trend that has been observed in the past weeks. Compared with the yo-yo price trend last year, the current upward movement appears more steady.
In China this week, various deals for granular sulphur were reported in the $160-163/t cfr range, showing a slight in- crease on last week. But majority of the buyers remain small to medium-sized fertilizer producers and traders; major players still bid at slightly lower values. Freight is estimated at $13-16/t between Middle East and China, it is therefore of no surprise that fob levels in the Middle East have also ticked up.
Aramco Trading in Saudi Arabia has sold 35,000t of spot sul- phur to a trader in the high-$140s/t fob, and this is believed to be coming from Yasref for July loading in Yanbu. Qatar's Tasweeq is thought to have made an award to a trader for second half July loading. Most bids were heard in the mid/ high-$140s/t fob leading to expectations of an award at under $150/t fob, however at press time there were strong indications that the deal had been concluded at $151/t fob.

pated after the Chinese New Year in February, prices eroded slightly but did not enter a free-fall. Some argue that it was down to a structural market tightness, which is expected to provide support to current sulphur prices and to potentially prevent prices from falling sharply even if Chinese buyers decided to exit the market in the next few weeks.
Taking into consideration the ramping up of Shah in the UAE and Yasref in Saudi Arabia as well as temporary demand loss from GCT, market prices globally have remain fairly steady since 2Q. Some attribute this to new sulphur production from Barzan/Qatar being delayed, Tengizchevroil's block be- ing completely depleted, OCP taking more tonnes as the new sulphur burner for the 1mn t/yr fertilizer complex enters operation, Mosaic potentially taking solid sulphur soon for its Florida melter that is expected to come on line in 4Q15.
But caution is still needed, as urged by many. While some suppliers maybe short and have paid higher fob prices to se- cure cargoes, there are also reports of others who have had to liquidate their position at below-market levels. The July price proposed by Aramco was welcomed by offtakers and the attention will soon switch to Tasweeq and ADNOC who are due to publish their monthly prices soon.
Third quarter contract negotiations have started in some places. Last few months the market saw stability across the globe, and most players agree that there are no big changes fundamentally to support a substantial shift in prices. This is with the exception of Kazakhstan, where sulphur inventory
-once as high as 9mn t back in 2009 - is depleted meaning producer TCO will have only its fresh production to offer to its contract buyers from this quarter onwards. The producer is said to be targeting an increase of $5-10/t for 3Q.

Phosphate market summary
The global phosphates market remains stable. Brazil and India are still in a hiatus period against relatively com- fortable suppliers. However, trade activity has picked up in several other markets including Argentina, Turkey, Pakistan and Southeast Asia.
Although the market is stable overall, there is a slightly more bearish tone in Brazil this week with reports of some offers dropping to the $490s/t cfr but these are likely from floaters. The pause in Brazil has been put down to two key reasons. The first reason being the avail- ability of the credit package announced by the govern- ment two weeks ago. Some argue that Brazilian demand inland has come to a halt as farmers are not willing to purchase any fertilizers until the credit announced by the government is available. There are reports that this could take as long as 45 days for the credit to appear in the banks.
The second reason is the poor correlation between fertil- izer and soybean prices, which has been deterring farm- ers from purchasing fertilizers. Due to the lack of farmer demand, distributors are reluctant to build inventory until there is more movement inland.
A similar view is taken on India. Demand currently is slow as buyers are well-covered for the kharif season and importers feel time is on their side to purchase for the rabi season. Indeed, over 3mn t is estimated to be lined up for April-July and some suggest that the Indians could be in a position to continue to sit out in July if prices are not favourable. But suppliers are not concerned about this slowdown as another estimated 2-2.5mn t is required for the rabi season, equivalent to an average of around 800,000 t/m for August-October. Of this, roughly 200,000- 250,000t could be met by the Saudis, Jordanians and possibly Russians leaving the Chinese with the lions share. Moreover, the monsoon is progressing well which is also providing an overall positive picture.
The outlook remains stable-to-firm through 3Q.
China sulphur stocks vs sulphur import price cfr
Prices pick up slightly
Most granular sulphur deals are reported in the low-$160s/t cfr this week, supported by end-users who confirm receiving offers at this level.
Two fertilizer producers are believed to have bought an import cargo each, for July arrival, at around $160/t cfr.
A trader was close to concluding 20,000t of Middle East sulphur with a buyer at $162/t cfr at press time. The cargo is for end-June loading for shipment to Fangcheng.
Another trader sold 60,000t of sulphur in total this week at as high as $163/t cfr.
One deal is reported at just under $165/t cfr; a trader has sold 35,000t of Middle East sulphur to an end-user for July loading/August arrival. The consensus between market play- ers, however, is the mid-$160s/t cfr is not yet firmly estab- lished at the moment and the deal may have been agreed between a trader and its long-term contract holder.
With freight from the Middle East quoted at $13-16/t (south- north China), the $160-163/t cfr range nets back to the high- $140s/t fob Middle East.
Molten sulphur prices are indicated in the low-$140s/t to the high-$150s/t cfr, following the trend of granular sulphur prices.
Crushed lump availability in China will be reduced as de- liveries from the Berri block to China will be halted during Ramadan.

Domestic prices firming and moving above import offers
Sales at the port of Nantong in China are firm at RMB 1,250/t exw for granular sulphur, with offers at RMB 1,260/t. Buyers have thus far been small and medium-sized fertilizer produc- ers and traders. Based on the current exchange rate ($1 to RMB6.21) the Nantong price is equivalent to the mid-$160s/t cfr, while many cfr offers for imported material are in the low-$160s/t cfr still.
Sinopec's Puguang gas field prices its sulphur at RMB 1,230/t ex-port Wanzhou, up by RMB 30/t on last week, and at RMB 1,190/t ex-works Dazhou, which is unchanged from the week before.
Operating rates at Puguang are not verified, with local reports suggesting 90,000-120,000 t/m. Around a month ago, production was estimated at 140,000 t/m, again down the rate of 160,000 t/m reported back in March/April.
Caution needed, warned market participants
The latest cycle of sulphur price growth has been a con- trolled one, compared with the yo-yo price movement last year. Some has attributed this to steady demand in China. While operations at DAP and MAP plants in China have been stable in the past month or two - supported by a flat export tax rate for DAP/MAP exports - major fertilizer produc- ers are said to be covered having made quiet purchases previously in smaller lots. The current round of purchases is supported mainly by small and medium-sized fertilizer producers and traders. The worry now shared between some participants is how much room is left for prices to grow as buyers are expected to withdraw from the market again once they are covered.
Issue 15-24  |  Thursday 18 June 2015
New supply, including production increase in the Middle East, is expected to be absorbed by fertilizer companies that are also expanding their capacity at least for this year. But this nevertheless contributed to a sentiment amongst some Chinese players - that the more new production is seen in the market, the lower prices of sulphur should be.
Taiwan
Formosa is not expected to be in the spot market until next month, when a sales tender for August loading should be floated.
India
Two deals were finalised lately in India:
FACT bought 25,000t in the mid-$160s from Swiss Singa- pore for 6-10 July arrival against its recent tender.
Coromandel, or CIL, has reportedly bought a cargo of 10,000t from a trader in the mid-$160s/t cfr for early July arrival. Swiss Singapore has been linked to the deal.
Argus FMB has narrowed the India cfr price assessment slightly to $163-168/t cfr to reflect spot business concluded this week. We acknowledge the high end relates to tonnes sold in small quantities to smaller buyers.
In June, the following shipments are due to arrive:
Marubeni's MV Seiyo Harmony will arrive in Paradeep on 25 June to discharge around 33,000t sulphur ex-Ras Laffan for IFFCO. Vessel arriving on 25 June at Paradeep. The deal was previously reported in the mid-$150s/t cfr.
Swiss Singapore's MV Amethyst is due to arrive in Paradeep on 21 June to discharge 38,494t of sulphur for
IFFCO.
In July, PPL is due to take 30,000t from Swiss Singapore in early-July and IFFCO is expected to receive a cargo from Transcom in mid-July. The aforementioned purchases by FACT and Coromandel are also scheduled to arrive in July.

Aramco Trading is understood to have sold a spot cargo of 35,000t for July loading in the high-$140s/t fob. The ton- nage is thought to come from Yasref - which would make this the second export cargo coming from the 400,000 b/d Saudi Aramco-Sinopec jv refinery. It has been previously
indicated that Yasref can offer around two export cargoes every quarter.
The last Yasref cargo was sold to OCP in Morocco in the mid- $140s/t fob Yanbu for late-May loading.

A sales tender by Tasweeq was closed on 16 June, for 35,000t of sulphur for 2H July loading. Majority of the play- ers who participated in the tender placed bids in the mid/ high-$140s/t fob and some received counters in the very high-$140s/t fob. At press time there are strong indications that the cargo was sold at $151/t fob to a trader.
Swiss Singapore loaded 38,494t on the MV Amethyst, which sailed on 9 June for Paradeep in India.
Marubeni loaded 31,500t on the MV Seiyo Harmony, also for Paradeep (IFFCO) and the vessel sailed on 15 June.

Barzan may be delayed
Argus understands that state-controlled RasGas is scheduled to bring its 1.4bn ft³/d (14.4bn m³/yr) Barzan gas project on line this month. But delays — as yet unacknowledged by the field's operator, state-controlled RasGas — may push start up to early 2016.
The progress with Barzan does not only affect sulphur production from Qatar (discussed below) but also Qatar's economic growth forecast.
Last week the Qatari ministry of development, planning and statistics lowering its official economic growth forecast to account for lower oil and LNG prices. The ministry said in an economic outlook that GDP will expand by 7.3pc in 2015 on the back of "continued vigour of the non-hydrocarbon sector and the boost to upstream hydrocarbon production from the Barzan gas project." A version of the report issued in Decem- ber last year forecast 7.7pc growth in 2015. Qatar's GDP grew by 6.1pc last year.
"Much of the acceleration [in economic growth] in 2015 is attributable to additional output from the Barzan project, which will come on stream in the middle of the year," said the ministry of development planning report. The delay at Barzan undermines the ministry's assumptions in its fore- cast and suggests GDP growth may prove less robust than expected this year. Barzan will be a more significant factor in 2016 and 2017 real growth.
The project is a joint venture between state-owned QP and ExxonMobil. Market indications were pointing to around 500,000-1mn t of sulphur to be produced by Barzan 1 this year. Argus FMB takes a more conservative look and expects around 250,000 t/yr of new production from the plant in 2015, but we maintain that there is the potential for greater production.

IGCC has made an award to a trader at $139/t fob Bandar Abbas for 30,000t of crushed lump sulphur for 1-10 July load- ing.
A tender for granular sulphur will be announced next week.
In Bandar Abbas, China Oil loaded 33,000t on the MV Top Genius that sailed on 14 June for China.
Jordan
It is believed that Indo Jordan has floated another tender, also for 40,000t for early July delivery. The buyer is thought to have bought from a trader at around $160/t cfr ex-Kuwait previously against its 10 June tender.
The last purchase in Jordan was by JPMC, who paid close to $160/t cfr for a 40,000t cargo. Swiss Singapore will deliver the cargo to Aqaba in mid-July. Around 41,500t were loaded on the MV Catamarca in Ruwais, sailed on 9 June for Aqaba.

Sherritt's Ambatovy nickel-cobalt mine is running although its finished nickel output in May was impacted by a plant strike in April, an unexpected outage at the plant caused by a high voltage transformer failure, and consequent overload damage to the two ore thickeners.
During the month, finished nickel production was approxi- mately 76pc of nameplate capacity, or 1,550t (compared with 1,244t in April and 1,231t in March). Ore throughput in the pressure acid leach (PAL) circuit was approximately 71pc of nameplate capacity.

The MV Yulia has been fixed to carry 25,000t of sulphur from Gdansk to Dakar on 22-24 June. Freight is estimated in the mid-teens.

NOC is offering a cargo of 8,000t to the market for early-July loading. Two spot cargoes previously sold for June loading have been destined for Egypt. The cargoes were sold in the very high-$120s/t fob Melittah.

The MV SCL Nicole discharged 6,600t of Repsol sulphur in Piombino, Italy, this week for Nuova Solmine.
Greece
Limited Greek supply in July
Following a tragic incident at Hellenic's Aspropyrgos refinery, where one employee was killed, the sulphur producer has declared force majeure and four sulphur vessels - totalling around 15,000t - for July lifting have been affected. The refinery was shut for much of the second quarter of May for a full-scale maintenance shutdown, then a fire on 8 May led to the death of one employee.
Motoroil's sulphur production is understood to be normal.
Bank of Greece fears 'uncontrollable crisis'
The Greek central bank on 17 June warned that failure to reach agreement between international creditors and the government would lead to default, exit from the euro and probably the EU, so a "manageable debt crisis" would "snow- ball into an uncontrollable crisis".
The bank said this would imply deep recession, a dramatic decline in income levels, an exponential rise in unemploy- ment, and Greece "would see itself relegated to the rank of a poor country in the European south".
Two weeks remain for Greece and its creditors, the EU and the IMF, to reach agreement. Eurozone finance ministers meet on 18 June for further talks on the issue.
On the sulphur side, the main concern is a potential Greek exit from the euro, which will affect any business that deals with the euro and other currencies.
Turkey
Since June, Tupras' Izmit refinery has been ramping up its new upgrading units that is designed to bring around 7,000- 9,000 t/m of sulphur. All sulphur production as part of the new upgrading units are to be bagged.
Last sale in Turkey is thought to be in the mid/high-$140s/t cfr.
West Europe
Limited movement expected for 3Q contract prices
Initial discussions between the buy and sell sides suggest that the market has been stable and as a result, the ma- jority agrees that there is no reason to stage a significant price increase or decrease. The unexpected weakening of the euro against US dollars in early 2Q has been less of an issue at present, putting less pressure on those who procure sulphur in US dollars and sell their downstream products in euros. Depending on the seller and the buyer, some are keen to recoup the increases/decreases that was not achieved in the second quarter and are expected to table a few dollars above/below 2Q levels.
France
Bayonne terminal down on technical problems
The Sobegi 200,000 t/yr sulphur remelting terminal in Bay- onne, France, has stopped running for four weeks because of technical problems; it was in turnaround for four weeks back in April and as a result has built up stocks in Bayonne.

FMB Spot Sales Selection - 18 June 2015
The MV Kimberly C discharged 6,500t of Cepsa sulphur in Bayonne, France, this week for Adisseo against contract. Another contractual cargo coming from Spain is expected to arrive in July. With the unplanned shutdown, the operator Adisseo is not expected to arrange any more sulphur ship- ments until the remelting facility restarts, now scheduled for next week.
La Mede not producing sulphur yet at press time
Total is restarting the 160,000 b/d La Mede refinery in France, including those units which were brought down by a major power outage on 5 June. But there was no sulphur production at the refinery yet at press time. Its production is estimated to be around 20,000 t/yr of sulphur.
The company said the start up process, began on 15 June, takes several days.
A crude unit and a reformer, which were not affected by the power outage, were ordered to shut down late on 12 June, following a strike by members of the CGT trade union federation a day earlier. This order was reversed on Monday 15 June when there were sufficient non-striking workers to safely carry out normal refinery operations.
The strike targets Total's plan to end conventional refining at the site. La Mede will cease crude refinery operations by
the end of 2016, and the loss of 20,000 t/yr of production from La Mede will be offset by Donges' new desulphurization capacity that will start up in end 2016.

Some third-quarter contract price negotiations between FSU suppliers and buyers have started. Russian producer Gaz- promExport (GPE) is likely to be targeting a slight increase, while the increase sought by Tengizchevroil (TCO) is more substantial.
Russia
Price discussions will kick off next week. With the overall market cited as being stabl, GPE is unlikely to be agreeing to any decreases; a rollover to slight increase is expected to be tabled by the sell side.
Kazakhstan
Kazakh sulphur producer TCO will be taking a different ap- proach and targeting a more substantial price increase as its sulphur block has already depleted. Latest official numbers show that in the first quarter of this year, TCO sold over 910,000t of sulphur, while it only produced 628,000t. This ate into TCO's block further and as of 31 March, TCO only had 8,000t of inventory left (compared with 265,000t of stocks as of 31 December 2014).
With 628,000t being produced in 1Q this gives an annualised total of 2.5mn t of sulphur, and around 1mn t of production is believed to be for the domestic market. In comparison, TCO sold 3.8mn t of sulphur for the whole of 2014, while producing just 2.4mn t.
There are unconfirmed reports that the producer is targeting an increase ranging from $5-10/t - reflecting the mid-$160s/t cfr on the high end for Brazil and North Africa.

Moa sulphur burner operational in 4Q16
Construction of the second sulphuric acid plant at Sher- ritt's Moa facility is going smoothly and now expected to be operational by the final quarter of 2016, slightly pushed back from estimates announced back in March. Moa's second sul- phur burner will have 2,000 t/day of sulphuric acid produc- tion capacity (around 667 t/d of sulphur consumption).
Once the new sulphur burner is operational, Moa will cut back its smelter acid imports, estimated at around 500,000 t/yr, and raise its sulphur consumption, mainly sourced from the west coast of Canada. All sulphur-based acid production will be for captive use.

In the first five months of the year, 32pc of Canadian sulphur went to Australia and 23pc went to China (much higher than the 12pc during the same period last year), making the link
