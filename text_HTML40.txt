SOP markets stable
Exchange Rate: USD 1 = RMB 6.2
Urea
Production
China’s prill urea output was 782.6kt during the fourth week of July, up significantly by 4.36% from the week before. Granular output was down by 3.26%, reaching 154.3kt. According to statistics of 29 July, daily urea output was 187kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 72.8%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 79.3%, while gas-based producers’ average is 57.16%.
Domestic market
This week, domestic urea markets slid, having almost no good news to support market confidence. Seasonal agricultural demand neared its end. Industrial demand was not strong overall. Some of the main urea makers showed pessimism, contending with decreasing shipments. Mainstream urea prices dropped by $5-16/t.
In North China, Shanxi Province’s urea market prices dropped somewhat; local agricultural demand was weak. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $252-258/t. In East China, Shandong Province’s urea markets are unchanged overall. There were some agriculture purchases in some areas; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $256-268/t. In Central China’s Henan Province, local urea prices went
Page 3
down again; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $261-266/t. In Southwest China, urea prices in Yunnan Province remained stable; shipments have stopped during the off season. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $298-305/t.
Urea inventories in the main seaports amount to 568,000 tons, up 60,000 tons from last week; of that, 220,000 tons is in Yantai Port, 100,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 60,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port, 70,000 tons in Rizhao Port, 70,000 tons in Jinzhou Port and 40,000 tons in Lianyungang Port.
Raw materials
Domestic anthracite markets kept running steady on the whole. Mainstream sale prices remained stable. Most coal companies in the main regions held comfortable inventories.
North China coal demand was sluggish as usual. The local distributors kept cautious, watching the market develop. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $123-127/t in Yangquan and Jincheng, the same as last week. In Central
China, Henan Province anthracite markets remained sluggish; middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices were $149/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $151/t in Yongcheng, like last week.
Southwest China’s anthracite markets remained normal. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $119/t.
Ammonium Sulfate
Domestic ammonium sulfate markets remained fatigued and prices dropped a bit. Focused on reducing inventory, some producers tried to slow production down. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 66.1% average operating rate, down slightly 0.2% from last week; however, caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers are operating at about 80% on average, up significantly 7% from last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $94-100/t in Shanxi Province, $102-108/t in Hebei Province, $113-118/t in East China, $97-105/t in Northeast China, and $90-100/t in Southwest China.

Two days later, Hebei Huafeng tendered ammonium sulfate, selling at $99/t, down $11/t from last week. On the same day, Shanxi Taiyuan Steel held a 750-ton ammonium sulfate tender; the starting price was $93/t, but the sale finally failed.
The main seaports’ combined ammonium sulfate inventory is 110,000 tons, up 35,000 tons from last week, with 30,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 10,000 tons in Qingdao Port and 70,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port.
Phosphate & NPK
Production
Typical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 70% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province, and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm maintained its recent low operating rate. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and still maintains an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.
Domestic phosphate
DAP – Domestic DAP markets kept steady for another week. More and more traders and distributors enquired about prices, but sales were rare. The main DAP makers focus on export markets, negotiating new orders and sending output to seaports were their current key points.
Central China DAP markets were almost unchanged overall. Most DAP makers continued to fulfill existing orders, sending output to North China, East China and Xinjiang AR. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content in Hubei Province stayed at $427-435/t, and the same product
delivered to North and East China destinations is $460-468/t; delivered prices for Xinjiang AR destination are $484-500/t. Southwest China’s DAP makers still paid attention to export this week; they had plenty of export orders to keep them busy till the end of this month, sending product to India and Pakistan. Mainstream FOB prices for DAP with 64% content are around $465/t.
Page 4
DAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 476,000 tons (up by 25,000 tons from last week); of that, 140,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 110,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 16,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 80,000 tons in Beihai Port, 70,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 40,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 20,000 tons in Nantong Port.
MAP – Domestic MAP markets fluctuated little. The main MAP makers had few new orders in hand and worked to fulfill existing orders. Downstream, NPK companies were unwilling to purchase raw material MAP, considering the current market conditions.
In Central China, Hubei Province’s Map markets remained steady, and prices were almost constant. Some of the main MAP producers were fulfilling existing orders, but new orders were rare. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $355/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $387-395/t for powder MAP with 60% content.
Southwest China MAP output started to exceed shipments; the prices of some MAP makers dropped a bit. Export orders for granular MAP also decreased somewhat. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces are $331/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $347/t for powder MAP with 60% content.
The main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 147,000 tons, up 47,000 tons from last week, including 47,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 70,000 tons in Nanjing Port.
SSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets remained stable; some of the main SSP makers ran at full load, while some others also maintained high operating rates. Mainstream ex-factory prices were $58-66/t for SSP (12%) and $77-81/t for SSP (16%).
Domestic TSP markets remained normal overall. Mainstream FOB prices stayed at $305-330/t for another week. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 107,000 tons – 50,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 10,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 17,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.

International phosphates
The international phosphates market remains showing the divided trends for East and West. There are the reports indicating a new, but small round of DAP importing business to India. This is for mainly China DAP in mid/high $470s/t cfr, giving flat trend. Some further Saudi DAP is being discussed for in the area of $480/t cfr. The China price would be unchanged, but the Saudi level would suggest the small decreases from the earlier levels. Pakistan is in the more quiet mode after the large buying of June/July. In the Americas market there is very slow activity.
The USA domestic purchasing has gone back to the slow levels, and NOLA DAP price reference stays at near $435/t short tonne. The Latin America import markets for MAP are inactive, as the seller offers are reduced to $480s/t cfr Brazil/Argentina on the trader volumes from Russia. The price from Morocco however is still targeted in $490s/t cfr from OCP. For Europe, the DAP price also sees some challenge from the buyers, the interest now to low $520s/t cfr.
Raw materials
Sulfur: Domestic sulfur markets went flat; orders were rare and the wait-and-see atmosphere was even stronger than last week. The main refineries showed concern about high sulfur inventories; some started to limit their production, while others were forced to cut their prices. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $173-189/t in Northeast China, $203-210/t in North China, $194-208/t in East China, $182-194/t in South China and $197-206/t in Southwest China.
Imported sulfur markets tended toward stability. Inventories of imported sulfur continued to grow. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 959,000 tons of sulfur on hand, 44,000 tons more than last week, with 390,000 tons in Nantong Port, 60,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 165,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 100,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 5,000 tons in Beihai Port, 15,000 tons in Longkou Port and 210,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.

Phosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets were still stable, and the shipments moved as usual. In Guizhou Province, the local phosphate rock markets fluctuated little overall. Mainstream rock prices remained steady; FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock markets were stable on the whole; the main rock producers maintained stable prices. Mainstream rock prices are stable at $42-45/t for 28% content at Mabian, $35/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock companies kept mining at a slow pace due to frequent rainfall; their rock prices stayed at $42/t for 28% content. In Central China, Hubei Province phosphate rock markets saw little improvement: $65-77/t for 28-30% content in Yichang.
NPK
whole. Only some cash crops gave rise to fertilizer demand. The NPK supply there is adequate; mainstream ex-factory prices are $306-323/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $355/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In North China, Shanxi Province’s NPK makers kept cautious to purchase raw material urea and MAP. Presently, mainstream ex-factory prices there are $298-306/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $347-371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In Central China, Hubei Province NPK makers maintained stable operating rates, but high summer temperatures worked against local NPK production. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $274-290/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $355-368/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).
Domestic NPK – Against the background of the newly announced autumn fertilizer offerings, domestic NPK markets remained depressed. Although the prices of raw materials were still high, most distributors and producers continued to hold a wait-and-see attitude. Mainstream prices are $306-323/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $355-371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as last week. In East China, Jiangxi Province’s markets remained stable on the
Page 6
Domestic SOP markets remained stable; the main SOP makers kept prices unchanged, and their operating rates averaged about 70%. Mainstream prices are $452-484/t for powder SOP with 50% content and $500-516/t for granular SOP with 50% content. Xinjiang Luobupo Company’s units have remained idle since June 27 for a two-month overhaul. Its annual SOP capacity is 1.7 million tons. The firm’s SOP prices remained stable: powder SOP with 51% content is $452/t and granular SOP with 51% content is $484/t.
International potash
In the global potash markets, the attention is returning to SE Asia markets. The discussion for strong potential interest
in SE Asia is not seen as yet. The main suppliers are starting now to anticipated for some interest in tenders for Indonesia, but the level of local currency against the US dollar is under great pressure. The last Malaysia spot levels at $310-315/t cfr are now below the target for new Canada business in $335/t cfr for standard and $350/t cfr for granular. The South America import granular MOP price is said to see some weakness now to $320/t cfr. Similar sentiment is being noted for the USA internal markets for the US barge price to be also weakening to the level of $305-310/short ton barge. For Europe, the price levels stay near €300/t cfr for the granular MOP grade.

New Fertilizer Project in China
1) Urea Project (1000tpy, Product)
Note: some new projects have been completed in 2011, and were delayed to put into production to 2012, such as Guodian Chifeng, Guizhou Jinchi, Jinxin Chemical, Kuitun Jinjiang Chemical and Yangmei Heshun.
We revised the 2011’s table and put these projects into 2012’s table. In addition, 520k tons of urea capacity of Inner Mongolia Tianrun has been delayed to 2013 due to uncertain factors. So the actual new capacity of urea in 2011 putting into production was 3.14m tons.
