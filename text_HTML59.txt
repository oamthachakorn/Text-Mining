Fertilizer Shipping Market Report
SUPRAMAX
Current trend: =
Little change in pacific from last week. This being said, there has been a slight increase in demand for vessels in north china with several NOPAC grain and local fertilizer stems–so although rates have not come up, we have seen a touch more activity in the market. In SE Asia, the majority of activity is based on the Indonesian coal movement into India or south china.
.
Outlook: =/UP
Far east will hold its position, without any major alterations
PANAMAX
Current trend: =
No major adjustments from last week as ECSA still remains the center of activity in the Atlantic. The Baltic index however came up a tick but little has changed on the trade routes and the tone is relatively bearish. Pacific maintained its focus on NOPAC rounds and trips out of Indonesia but the time charter rates remained under pressure, with some competition from the smaller sized tonnage. There was little short period activity as rates continued to stay on the low side.
Outlook: =
There are limited factors indicating an upswing and we believe the current trend will continue for rest of the month.

The market in se.asia remains steady this week with few fresh enquiries.  |     |     |     |     |     |  Week Number (2014 -2015)  |     |     |     |     |

There have been a handful of spot cargos from south china although  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
