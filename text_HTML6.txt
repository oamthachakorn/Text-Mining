ANALYSIS
Values move little on supply demand balance
Stability prevails with available ammonia supply and demand balanced. The scenario appears unlikely to change over the coming month.
Most market activity continues to centre on the Black Sea as Trammo mopped up 40,000 mt from suppliers OPZ, NF Trading and DniproAzot for use against business in Turkey and Israel. The trader reports deals were fixed above $390/mt FOB, although its recent reported 7,000 mt sale to Turkey’s Bagfas was said to provide Black Sea netbacks nearer $380-385/mt FOB.
On-going US supply disruptions are likely the reason Koch secured an additional 40,000 mt Yuzhnny tonnes from OPZ and Ameropa for loading on the Jenny N at the end of June. These tonnes were suggested secured around the $390/mt FOB mark or marginally below.
Downward price pressure on such values remains as OCP continues to push for prices below $400/mt CFR for July. The buyer claims its tanks are more or less full and is in no hurry to buy additional tonnage. Tunisian demand is still limited owing to recent strikes and the suspension of phosphates fertilizers output. There are initial signs that production may gradually to normal thereby stimulating additional ammonia demand, but this may take another month at least.
East of Suez, stability also reigns, with sales by Sabic to Mitsui and Fertil to Trammo concluded within the current Middle East range keeping the market balanced. Both cargoes will likely be used against contract commitments in Asia given regional buyers’ overall lack of interest in spot tonnage. This is much the same situation for Marubeni after securing 15,000 mt from Malaysia’s Petronas, with the parcel being used for contract deliveries in Japan and South Korea despite attempts to conclude a spot deal.
Indian ammonia demand continues to provide little cheer for suppliers although prices remain stable at $415- 450/mt CFR. Spot demand is virtually non-existent except for a small parcel sold to Tata Chemicals by Trammo at the high end of the range.
The outlook is more positive in the US where Mosaic intends to run at high rates through the summer and should not have any reason to cut its ammonia consumption. It has recently lowered one of its key indicators for the US domestic DAP market and continues to be content to follow the lead of other suppliers overseas.
Domestic US ammonia consumption appears to be meeting expectations, based on anecdotal reports. Inland ammonia values are creeping down though, likely influenced by wet weather that may cut into ammonia's side-dress business for the US corn crop.
Highlights of the week:
∙Trammo buys 40,000 mt ex-Yuzhnny above $390/mt FOB
∙Koch buys 40,000 mt from OPZ and Ameropa around $390/mt FOB
∙Trammo sells 6-7,000 mt to Bagfas at $413/mt CFR
∙Fertil sells 10-15,000 mt to Trammo within publish Middle East range
∙Mitsui secures 23,000 mt from Sabic under formula pricing
∙Trammo sells under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals around $450/mt CFR
∙Marubeni buys 15,000 mt from Petronas under formula pricing
Short term outlook
Values are set to remain flat on regular supply and buying.
Ammonia versus DAP
With MAP shipments to Brazil taking priority this month out of Morocco plus a good line up of DAP and MAP into Europe, demand for ammonia should remain solid through June. A similar trend is expected for July with MAP and DAP expected to remain the dominant products once more. Renewed demand should start to surface from Tunisia as rock supplies to the downstream plants are resumed and GCT strives to meet potential DAP commitments in Turkey and southern Europe for June shipment onwards.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.
MARKETS
AMMONIA
NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Bearish DAP signals weigh on ammonia
Summer pricing for US domestic DAP and MAP may well fuel Mosaic and other US phosphate producers' determination to hold the line on ammonia costs, and perhaps even pursue a cheaper deal for July in coming weeks. Mosaic is maintaining an aggressive price stance in order to continue selling into the domestic and Latin American markets in coming weeks, and it may expect its ammonia suppliers to support that program with a reduction in the current $450/mt CFR Tampa price tag.
US: April imports gain thanks to FSU cargoes
US ammonia arrivals in April increased marginally to 564,287 st (511,918 mt) from 515,269 st (467,449 mt) one year earlier, as FSU cargos more than made up for a decline in discharges from Trinidad and Tobago.
According to the US Department of Commerce, April supplies included 359,341 st from Trinidad and Tobago, down from 368,802 st during April 2014. On the other hand imports from the FSU jumped to 88,025 st from 44,063 st over the same months. Another key supplier in April of this year was Canada at 98,261 st.
The April volume brought US imports during the first 10 months of its fertilizer year to 4.87 million st (4.41 million mt). The largest ammonia suppliers to the US during July-April remain Trinidad and Tobago at 3.2 million st, Canada at 933,878 st and the FSU at 437,137 st.
US Midwest: Slightly lower price tag for side-dress use
Midwest distributors have been more aggressive with ammonia pricing in recent days, with quotes around $600/st FOB from inland terminals east of the Mississippi River and indications cloer to $590/st FOB from terminals along the upper river system and rail quotes from the Dakotas to Iowa. Much of the corn ground still was drying out on both sides of the Mississippi River this week, but warm and dry winds increased optimism that ammonia side-dress applications would restart by the end of the week.
US California: Drought remains a drag on sales
Ammonia in California is down at least $20/st from prior weeks, but weaker indications are unlikely to drive trade. The state continues to suffer from a three-year drought. While the state's farm output and fertilizer consumption exceeded expectations despite the lack of rain, suppliers believe farming will inceasingly be limited to areas that can tap into deep wells. Farmers that rely on rainfall will be able to do less and less, further limiting the need for ammonia and other products. Recent quotes for ammonia are cited around $570- 580/st DEL.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Trammo and Koch busy once again
Trammo has secured 40,000 mt from Black Sea suppliers NF Trading, OPZ and DnieproAzot, suggested above $390/mt FOB. The tonnage will be lifted on the Marycam Swan and Touraine this month against business in Turkey and Israel.
Trammo’s recent 6-7,000 mt sale to Turkey’s Bagfas for mid-June delivery reportedly provides Black Sea netbacks nearer $380-385/mt FOB.
Koch secured a further 40,000 mt from OPZ and Ameropa to load June 20-25 on the Jenny N, also suggested fixed at $390/mt FOB or marginally below. Early indications are that the vessel will head to the US given on-going reports of production issues at Koch’s US facilities.
EUROPE
Turkey: Trammo sells another cargo to Bagfas
Trammo is linked to the sale of 6-7,000 mt to Bagfas at $413/mt CFR for mid June delivery this week, reflecting a slight weakening in values. Trammo will use the Sylvie which has finished loading in Rouen for the transaction
Petkim said it will likely issue an enquiry for 6,000 mt spot cargo at the end of June for mid July delivery.
Gemlik, meanwhile, has no ammonia available for export at present with all plants running well.
Toros and Trammo have signed a five year ammonia supply agreement, formalizing their existing relationship. Trammo will supply ammonia to Toros across the producer's sites in Samsun, Ceyhan and Mersin over the five years on a regular basis for the majority of Toros' annual requirement.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Algeria: Sorfert I ammonia and urea units back up soon
Algerian producer Sorfert indicated it expects its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up to commercial output shortly. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.
Tunisia: Recovery in fertilizer production continues
Ameropa confirmed it will be directing either the Gas Cobia or Gas Manta with 23,000 mt to Tunisia this month as AN production continues.
There was further optimism this week that Tunisian fertilizer output is slowly getting back on track. Phosphate rock production at the Kef Eddour mine has resumed and phosphate rock will then be supplied to the downstream plants. This will in turn boost ammonia demand.
Morocco: Imports up as OCP takes another NF cargo
Moroccan ammonia imports for March 2015 at 61,623 mt ran 8.7% ahead of the same time last year, prompted by low ammonia values and greater tank storage capacity.
Year-to-date figures are up 7% at 219,359 mt helped by a strong import month in February.
This year has seen OCP diversify its ammonia supply sources with product arriving from the Black Sea and Algeria. It has also secured ammonia directly from Black Sea suppliers such as NF Trading and chartered vessels from traders to bring the cargo to Jorf Lasfar.
The Gaschem Stade is expected back in Yuzhnny June 9 to load another 23,000 mt Rossosh material for OCP with the buyer claiming the deal was was struck around $400/mt CFR. This has not been confirmed by the supplier.
Saudi Arabia: Sabic concludes another spot deal
Sabic has sold 23,000 mt to Mitsui under a formula pricing arrangement for mid July loading. The vessel has not yet been nominated but ther cargo will be directed to the Far East for use against Mitsui's contract commitments in the region.
UAE: Fertil books ammonia sale with Trammo
Fertil has sold 10-15,000 mt ammonia to Trammo within the current Middle East index range. The cargo will be lifted in July on the Brussels against contract business in the Far East.
Its 760,000 mt/year Fertil I urea line and the 430,000 mt/year ammonia line were shut down last month for maintenance and were due to restart at the end of May. This has now been pushed back to June 9-10.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: No improvement in demand, and prices stable
Indian ammonia demand remains lacklustre and prices are still pegged at $415-450/mt CFR.
Trammo said it sold under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals for prompt delivery to Haldia off the Tobolsk at the high end of the Indian index price.
IFFCO is set to receive a 40,000 mt contract cargo from Ameropa off the Clipper Mars at the end of June.
India: FACT issues ammonia tender closing June 5
FACT has issued a new ammonia import tender for 7,500 mt closing June 5. Shipment is requested 26-30 June Cochin.
This follows the scrapping of its May 11 tender for 2x7,500 mt due to high priced offers. The buyer said it is seeking offers in the low $400s/mt CFR in the latest session.
FACT had hoped to restart its Udyogamandal ammonia facility this month but this has now been postponed until June 1.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Malaysia: Marubeni secures Petronas cargo
Marubeni is linked to the purchase of a 15,000 mt Petronas cargo for July lifting on the Bunga Kemboja under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo will likely be used against contract commitments in the Far East.
Last week Koch bought a 16,000 mt Petronas ammonia cargo for June lifting on the Bunga Kemobja, also under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo is to be used against Koch’s contract with SFC in Korea.
South Korea: Namhae pushes back spot ideas to September
Namhae had now fixed its contract delivery schedule up to the first half of August and will likely push back any enquiries for tonnage outside contract volumes to September.
Around 8,000 mt will be discharged in Ulsan next week by Mitsubishi off the Sanko Innovator, followed by a 15,000 mt parcel from Yara off the Nordic River that was recently secured under a spot deal at $433/mt CFR.
Sentiment that prices may weaken further in the region owing to poor industrial demand remains, although Middle East buyers contend prices should firm in response to limited spot cargo availability.
