ANALYSIS
Indian tender at centre of attention
The June 19 STC tender for an unspecified quantity of prilled or granular urea to load by July 27 attracted significant attention this week as producers and traders attempted to ascertain competition for the business.
Opinions on pricing in offers to be submitted in the tender vary substantially. Consensus is however building for mainstream numbers well in excess of $315/mt CFR for East Coast India (ECI) ports such as Krishnapatnam offering fast discharge terms. This based on expected FOB values above $300/mt FOB from China.
Higher freights for panamax carriers and the supramax segment are indicative of freights around $12/mt from northern China for the larger sizes, and some $2-3/mt more for supramax tonnage. Transaction costs are assessed at $2-3/mt for a package around an even $15/mt with very limited provisions for margins.
Availability from Iran to load by July 27 is assessed below 400,000 mt with costs likely to pan out around $300/mt FOB or marginally lower. Freight is estimated above $10/mt and suppliers of Iranian material also need to factor in provisions for insurance which is for seller's account acording to STC tender terms. This plus transaction charges and the extra costs of processing payments for Iranian material also point to delivered values higher than $315/mt CFR for fast WCI ports.
More aggressive offers from either origin can however not be excluded. Some traders point to added availability of Chinese urea in July as domestic demand wanes, and may elect to short the market down to netbacks available in recent small regional trades around $295/mt FOB, if not lower.
Offers for July positions in paper markets for Middle East tonnage posted at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at an even $300/mt FOB were attracting bids no higher than $295/mt FOB June 18, indicating that competitive offers to STC may also emerge from this source.
Limited availability through July from the Black Sea does not suggest competition from FSU tonnage, but offers based on firm quotes in paper markets for July positions at $288-290/mt FOB Yuzhnyy could conceivably match mainstream offers from China for WCI ports basis current freight estimates.
The US market is meanwhile also in traders' focus. Soaring values for prompt barge positions, already have attracted tonnage that had originally been planned for delivery to Brazil. Four cargos of granular
urea totaling about 110,000 mt previously expected to head for Brazil now are destined for the US from
Algeria, with arrival dates from June 25 to 2H July. The July lineup, fattened somewhat be delays in arrivals from June, has reached 900,000 mt.
This is despite declines in offers for 1H July barges. While barges confirmed for delivery before he July 4 holiday sold around $350/st FOB New Orleans, forward offers of physical tons for 1H July were available at $300-305/st FOB at press time. August offers were cited in the $290s/st FOB, and a physical sale at $295/st FOB was confirmed at press time.
Markets for prilled urea outside India have been less active as traders are unwilling to assume significant risk in adding length or going short ahead of the Indian session.
Tenders scheduled in Sri Lanka for granular and prilled urea and in Nepal for prills have attracted some attention while the upcoming sessions in Pakistan to procure a further 150,000 mt are yet to be announced.
Highlights of the week
∙STC tender June 19 at center of attention
∙US July import lineup reaches 900-950,000 mt, forward offers plunge
∙Chinese prills trade at par with regular quality granular, albeit via short positions
∙Sri Lankan MoA awards Dreymoor and floats additional tender
∙Pakistan tenders yet to be floated, but suggested imminent
∙Sorfert in Algeria running well, and AOA output also suggested restored
∙Brazilian importers maintain hard-line despite diversions of cargos to the US
∙Egyptian output still erratic but MOPCO II trials start
Short term outlook
Mixed, but bears outside the US have gathered a slightly larger following than bulls in recent days. Market direction will be clearer June 19 when offers in the STC tender are submitted, but quotes in that session are expected to be relatively widely spread. The general agreement for downward adjustments in granular values from recent US peaks is still apparent, but the timing remains an open question.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
Canada: Dry conditions hammer crops, cut urea use
Market expectations in western Canada have undergone a 180 degree turn and distributors are expecting substantially lower fill pricing in coming weeks. Just a month or two ago, railcars of urea were moving from the US for applications on canola and other crops. But severely dry weather since then threatens yields and warehouses in Alberta and elsewhere have substantial carryover granular urea.
US N Plains: Cheaper fill offers tug on spot values
Spot offers of granular urea for prompt delivery crept down this week to around $390/st DEL for trucks and railcars. However, more severe cuts in prompt pricing are likely given fill offers from suppliers for summer delivery from Canada and elsewhere.
Late season disappointment with Canadian demand has led to more aggressive pricing for summer granular urea by Agrium and others into the Dakotas. Offers are as low as $345/st DEL. This is down about $50/st from prior weeks. This price tag likely will be reflected in the prompt market for the Dakotas by July, if not sooner, according to regional distributors.
US NOLA: Trader shorts drive June sales, July weaker
Push almost came to shove between a few traders on some short sales that needed to be covered by June
15.Multiple sources report that a number of these deliveries had not been completed by close of business June 16.
Most or all of the transactions reported in recent days at $370-380/st FOB New Orleans are accounted for in efforts by traders to find prompt cover for H1 June shorts. Meanwhile, prompt granular urea barges available by the end of this month have sold as low as $343-346/st FOB, but most business appears to be in the $350s/st FOB this week.
By the end of the week, prior sales of early July granular barges at $350-353/st FOB were a memory, and H1 July business was cited around $310/st FOB and physical offers through the FIS service were down to $303/st FOB.
Prilled urea has sold at New Orleans this week at $310-315/st FOB.
China Oil's pamanax of Chinese granular urea will not reach New Orleans until the first 10 days of July, not in June as has been claimed elsewhere.
The spot lineups for the US June and July now also include 107,000 mt of granular urea divided between four cargos loading from Algeria. The importers are Ameropa arriving June 25 with 23,000 mt, Trammo
arriving June 27 with 30,000 mt, Indagro with 27,000 mt in the first two weeks of July and Koch with 27,000 mt in 2H July.
A rumored Gavilon cargo of Chinese granular for July arrival proved incorrect.
US S Plains: More rain coming, but prices rise
Granular urea truckloads have sold as high as $410/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River, even though another 5-10 inches of rain is predicted for Oklahoma and Arkansas this week. Texas already has seen heavy rains this week.
Urea prices are rising despite the poor weather outlook because retailers expect substantial demand wherever conditions permit as soon as the storm passes.
Predictions over when barge travel along the Arkansas River will return to normal are increasingly negative. Travel through to Inola Oklahoma may not be restored for at least two weeks, according to various distributors in the region. Meanwhile, distributors are reduced to buying truckloads from terminals along the lower Mississippi River as far south as New Orleans, and driving product 25 st at a time to enduser markets in Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Texas.
US Midwest: Wet weather prevents demand spike
Even though there is plenty of top-dress demand for corn yet to be satisfied, wet weather continues to slow applications. As a result pricing is far from keeping pace with recent spot costs out of the barge market. Early this week granular urea still was selling from river terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $370/st FOB, $5/st or more below FOB New Orleans quotes.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Diversions of vessels not alarming buyers
The diversions of vessels carrying granular urea originally intended for Brazil from the Middle East and North Africa to the US has yet to impact Brazilian buyers' willingness to pay up to secure additional material.
Offers in the low $320s/mt CFR tabled by sellers at the end of last week failed to elicit firm buying interest. Importers indicate that quotes marginally below $320/mt CFR are currently available, despite the
recent increase in freights for large carriers loading from the Middle East and other regional sources.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Belarus: Regional demand supports exports
While down on the March volume, April exports of urea from Belarus identified by customs via GTIS close to 6,000 mt were up on April 2014. The entire quantity was delivered to Poland.
This lifted January-April exports to 151,000 mt, up by a full 221% on the prior year. Poland accounted for 60,000 mt, Germany for 24,000 mt and Lithuania for 15,000 mt.
Russia: Exports of urea through April down by 19.3%
Competition from other sources such as China in Q1 saw Russian urea exports as identified by customs via GTIS drop by 19.3% to 1.39 million mt in the first four months of 2015.
The firmer stance on pricing adopted by Chinese sellers did however help to trigger Russian April exports of 364,000 mt, down by a mere 0.8% on April 2014. Deliveries to Mexico, partly replacing Chinese granular and Ukrainian prills of 49,000 mt were up by 68% on April 2014. Deliveries to Brazil were down by 3.2% to 42,000 mt but exports to Canada of 28,500 mt were up sharply on the prior year. Deliveries to Turkey of a mere 20,000 mt were down by 70% due to competition from China and Iran.
Brazil accounted for 277,000 mt out of the January-April volume, down by 14% on the same period in 2014. Deliveries to the US of 158,000 mt were down by 33.2% but shipments to Germany of 158,000 mt were up by a substantial 53%. Despite the April surge, Mexico accounted for 76,000 mt in January-April, down by 53% on the first four months of 2014. Deliveries to Turkey of 45,000 mt were down by 70%.
Black Sea: Traders hold off despite limited availability
Traders are in no rush to add Black Sea prilled tonnage for June and July despite lower offers from producers and marketers. Offers to secure repeat business in the low $290s/mt FOB have yet to trigger significant buying interest.
Paper markets are also indicative of subdued activity ahead of tomorrow's tender in India. Firm offers for July positions from Yuzhnyy that were posted at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $290/mt FOB attracted bids at $285/mt FOB while the bid-offer spread for August was $280-$285/mt FOB.
The lineup for June loading is close to 72,000 mt following the addition of the Dreymoor vessel to load for NF for Italy:
EUROPE
Spain: March imports up
Imports of urea by Spain identified by Eurostat via GTIS in March of 82,400 mt were up by 14.6% on March 2014, but Q1 imports of 307,800 mt nevertheless lagged Q1 2014 by 4.16%.
Russia accounted for 15,500 mt of the March volume, up by 174% on March 2014 and deliveries from Ukraine were up from zero to 14,000 mt. Arrivals from Germany were up by 108% to 22,200 mt but arrivals from Egypt were down by 72.6% to a mere 4,200 mt.
Algeria accounted for 67,400 mt out of the Q1 2015 volume, up by 146% on the prior year while arrivals from Germany were up by 24.8% to 46,000 mt.
Russia accounted for 31,000 mt and Ukraine for 28,600 mt. Deliveries from Egypt were down by 80% to 15,000 mt and arrivals from the UAE were down to zero from 30,000 mt in Q1 2014.
Romania: Q1 exports down
Romanian exports of urea continued to fall in Q1 2015, with the 44,500 mt exported in the quarter identified by Eurostat via GTIS down by 77% on Q1 2014. March exports of a mere 12,800 mt were down by 84.5% on March 2014, and were shipped almost entirely to nearby, inland markets.
Serbia accounted for 19,500 mt of the Q1 volume, up by 52%, but other markets registered significant declines. Shipments to the US dropped from 51,000 mt in Q1 2014 to zero in 2015 and deliveries to Turkey were down from 37,600 mt to 2,900 mt.
Germany: Urea Q1 exports lower but imports are up
Exports of urea from Germany identified via Eurostat via GTIS were down by 5.8% through Q1 while imports registered an increase of 11.25%.
March exports of 76,200 mt were off by 12.5% and Q1 exports of 223,400 mt were off by 5.8%. The UK took delivery of 35,100 mt in the quarter, down by 23% while shipments to Canada of 33,000 mt were up by 50% and deliveries to Poland of 23,000 mt were down by 13.5%.
March imports of 87,800 mt were up by 22.8% on the prior year with deliveries from Iran of 19,700 mt up from zero and arrivals from Belarus up from 3,000 mt to 18,300 mt. Russia accounted for 16,700 mt, down by 45.8%.
Q1 imports of 257,000 mt were up by 11.25%. Russian arrivals of 98,000 mt remained in the lead, but were off by 4.5%. Deliveries from the Netherlands of 33,000 mt were down by 25% while arrivals from Belarus of 30,400 mt were up by 402%.
Croatia: Q1 exports down on 2014
Croatian exports of urea in Q1 2015 of 64,100 mt identified by customs via GTIS were down by 28.6% on the Q1 2014 volume. Serbia accounted for 28,600 mt, followed by Italy with 9,800 mt and Austria with 9,600 mt. Exports to Turkey were not registered in Q1 but these will appear April onwards following numerous small sales of prills, mainly to industrial customers.
UK: Urea imports up through April
Urea imports by the UK in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 44,800 mt were up by 43.3% on April 2014 and January-April imports of 323,500 mt were up by 44.2% on the same period in the prior year.

Deliveries from Germany of 51,500 mt were off by 3% while arrivals from Egypt of 27,400 mt were up by 5.3%. Arrivals from Qatar and Algeria of 24,200 mt and 24,000 mt were up from zero in the prior year.
Netherlands: Urea Q1 exports up sharply
Exports of urea from the Netherlands identified by Eurostat via GTIS in Q1 2015 of 607,500 mt were up by a massive 88% on Q1 2014.
March exports of 141,300 mt were up by 6.7%. March deliveries to Belgium of 24,000 mt were up by 27.7% and deliveries to Spain were up by 32%.
Belgium was also the biggest outlet for Q1 exports with 108,000 mt while Germany accounted for 80,000 mt, the UK for 76,400 mt and France for 68,500 mt.
Italy: Prompt demand tapers off as season ends
Demand for prompt positions of granular urea has tapered off in Italy as application for corn has essentially ended. Buyers are concentrating on vacation-plans rather than urea purchasing at present.
The flurry of activity in March and April is already reflected in March import data provided by Eurostat via GTIS. March urea imports of 113,000 mt were up by 32.8% on March 2014 with Iran taking the lead with 26,300 mt, up from zero. Deliveries from Ukraine of 24,600 mt were down by 10.4% but arrivals from Russia of 23,600 mt were up by 322% on March 2014.
Q1 imports of 246,600 mt were nevertheless down by 18.2% on Q1 2014. Ukraine accounted for 66,600 mt, down by 31.4% but Russia was up by a massive 485% on the prior year to reach 56,400 mt and deliveries from Iran were up from zero to 31,000 mt. Egypt continued to suffer from limited availability and saw shipments drop by 80% to 23,300 mt. Deliveries from China were up from zero to 17,400 mt while Croatian imports dived by 71.5% to 9,800 mt.
France: Trade in granular subdued and imports slow
Trades in granular urea in France remains slow as importers hold off on forward purchasing. Trades are suggested by suppliers around an even €300/mt FCA, but distributors contend that offers closer to €290/mt FCA are freely available for the summer months.
Imports of urea in April identitied by Eurostat via GTIS close to 160,000 mt were meanwhile down by about 13% on April 2014. Imports from Algeria of 25,700 mt were down marginally on March 2014, while imports from Oman and Kuwait jumped from zero to 24,000 mt and 21,000 mt, respectively.
January-April imports of 544,000 mt were down by about 11% on the same period in 2014 but deliveries from Algeria of 123,000 mt were up by 7.1%. Arrivals
from Russia of 72,500 mt were down by 43.6% and shipments of 52,500 mt from Netherlands were off by 31%. Deliveries from Egypt of 41,500 mt were down by 69%.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Algeria: Sorfert sees regular output, more nominations
Sorfert reports regular output of urea following the May closure due to technical issues, and the producer's shipping programme for June continues to build, albeit at a relatively slow pace.
Following shipments of around 100,000 mt in May, the producer has loaded/accepted nominations for six vessels for a total close to 75,000 mt from contract holders Indagro (27,800 mt), Koch (16,000 mt), Nitron (15,400 mt plus 6,600 mt), Keytrade (4,000 mt) and Helm (3,400 mt) to load in June.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Sri Lanka: MoA awards Dreymoor, issues new tender
The MoA elected to award the June 9 tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags to Dreymoor at the trader's lowest offers in the session based on 270 days credit. A new tender for 48,000 mt granular urea plus 12,000 prilled urea in bags is set to close June 29.
Dreymoor booked the granular urea in the June 9 session at $347.26/mt CFR and the prills at $345.86/mt CFR, both inclusive of 270 days credit.
The June 29 tender requests offers for the tonnage to be available in Sri Lanka for local distribution in bags by the end of September, and also includes a requirement for TSP and MOP.
Pakistan: Fertilizers exempt from added tax
Further to the June 9 update regarding the possible 1% increase in the import tariff for fertilizers for 2015- 2016, news from Pakistan indicates that the government has elected not to include Agricultural inputs - including fertilizers - in the proposed tariff increase. The tax on imported urea will therefore remain unchanged at 1%.
TCP tenders for the additional 150,000 mt cleared for import by the ECC are meanwhile yet to be issued.
India: STC floats urea tender to close June 19
The long awaited tender for urea by STC to complement prior IPL purchases was issued June 12. The session calls for offers for an unspecified quantity of urea to load by July 27. Offers are to be submited by 11:00hrs Indian Standard Time on June 19 and are to remain valid through June 23.
Indian urea producer National Fertilizers Ltd. has meanwhile reported that its 510,000 mt/year Bathinda urea plant in Punjab that closed down for maintenance May 11 resumed production June 7.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Corn application set to taper off
Domestic prices for prilled urea are relatively stable but are expected to ease into July when application for corn will end. Trades in northern China are reported at RMB 1,700-1,730/mt ($274-279/mt) EXW
while business was done in Shanxi at RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) FCA.
Offers for prills for export were available at RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main northern ports, indicative of an export value around $307/mt FOB plus costs/margins to intermediaries.
Trades into regional markets such as Taiwan and Vietnam were nevertheless reported at netbacks down to about $295/mt FOB, but these are widely expected to be short sales by traders expecting a softer forward market once domestic demand for corn application eases.
Trades in granular positions in Shanxi were concluded above those for prills, with parcels changing hands at RMB 1,680/mt ($271/mt) FCA, suggesting export values at a mere $3/mt premium on prilled values. Netbacks on recent export deals are around $307/mt FOB for regular quality while premium granular quality has traded again above the $310/mt FOB marker.
Inventories at ports are also stable on last week with about 300,000 mt indicated available for shipment from Yantai and Quinhuangdao with the majority in the form of granular urea.
Exporters and traders are busy formulating strategies for the June 19 STC tender in India that permits loading through July 27. Mainstream offers are expected to be based on netbacks to producers above $305/mt FOB, but some traders may opt to consider taking short positions at returns down into the $290s/mt FOB. Freights for the supramax and panamax segments are up further over the last two weeks, suggesting rates closer to $15/mt rather than $10/mt for fast ports on East Coast India.
New Zealand: Ballance in talks with suppliers
Ballance Agri-Nutrients has been in discussions with suppliers pursuant to a June 17 request for offers for around 25,000 mt granular urea for July shipment. A deal for the cargo to load from Malaysia or Indonesia has been suggested, but could not be verified with the importer at press time.
Taiwan: TFC awards June 15 tender
The June 15 TFC tender for 6,000 mt prilled urea for June or early July loading is reported to have resulted in an award to a trader offering Chinese urea around $318-320/mt CFR. The price suggested reflects a producer netback marginally above $295/mt FOB if loaded from a northern port in China.
Imports of urea in April ascertained by customs via GTIS of a mere 7,500 mt were down by 60% on April 2014. Deliveries from China in April accounted for 7,300 mt. The April volume brought January-April imports to 35,600 mt, down by close to 50% on the same period in 2014, with China supplying 34,700 mt.
Vietnam: More Indonesian granular urea trades
Koch is linked with sales of about 20,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim production for June/July loading to importers in Vietnam. A further deal for 10,000 mt is being negotiated.
Exact details on the transactions were not released, but the sales were reported concluded marginally below $330/mt CFR, to be shipped in lots of 6-10,000 mt each.
An offer for Chinese prills are suggested available for a small 3,000 mt lot from a Korean trader down to $310/mt CFR while parcels of 6-7,000 mt are on offer around $315/mt CFR, in line with this week's sale in Taiwan.
South Korea: Namhae to test prilled values
Namhae will be seeking to improve on offers submitted to TFC in Taiwan for prilled urea around $317/mt CFR when tendering to buy 6,000 mt prills via tender June 19.
South Korean imports of urea in May 2015 registered by customs via GTIS of 56,500 mt, all from China, were meanwhile up by 3.5% on May 2014. This brought the January-May 2015 volume to 376,000 mt, up by 4% on the same months in 2014.
China accounted for 346,400 mt of the
2015 total, up by 24%, while deliveries from Qatar of 25,000 mt were down by 57.6%.
