Global Urea Position
After a poor January, February has begun in a more positive fashion for suppliers. Price increases have been achieved and further gains seem likely as February tonnage is now at a premium.
∙The US Gulf has been pivotal in providing a foundation for the price uptick with prices there now reflecting over $210pt fob Middle East for March barges.
∙While not in its major buying period, Brazil is seeking prompt tonnage. Little product is on offer with the diversion of Middle East product to the US Gulf a factor. Buyers are facing offers of $205pt cfr and above.
∙Supply problems in Egypt and Algeria have played a part with product lost from several plants.
∙Middle East product has ben sold for shipment to Europe over $200pt fob.
∙In Asia Indonesian supply is locked in for now with no willingness to sell at current levels. Chinese prilled and granular suppliers headed into the New Year holiday quoting $195-200pt fob for prills and $200pt fob minimum for granular. Thai spot demand also emerged with a cargo sold at $196pt cfr, a price that looks set to be the low for the next 1-2 months.
∙FSU prills have also recovered with traders covering short sales to Europe, Turkey and Africa paying up to $192pt fob Baltic and $200pt fob Yuzhnyy.
With most February tonnage accounted for, traders short and buyers still needing February/first half March shipments, the scene appears set for prices to move higher over the coming weeks. As indicated in the 2 February forecast, the real test of the market will come in Q2 when demand for new shipments to N America and Europe eases.

Urea Supply - West
Black Sea
Yuzhnyy: A number of inquiries have been evident for urea with producers not prepared to consider prices sub-$200pt fob. These include an inquiry for 10,000t prompt for Gubretas Turkey.
A trader has 8,000t booked around $200pt fob for shipment to Hungary via Constanza. Two producers are understood to have concluded a number of small sales late last week at $200pt fob and above.
NF states that is focusing product on the domestic market and is not offering for export..
Ameropa is in the freight market for 5,000t of urea Yuzhnyy-Ravenna, loading 8-10 February.
Tuapse: Trammo is in the freight market for 3,500t from Tuapse to Inebolu, Turkey, loading 9-11 February.
Baltic
Covering of short sales by traders has resulted in prilled urea sales at $187-192pt fob. One 5,000t lot has been sold at $192pt fob and 25,000t for early March in the high-$180s pt fob (this for Africa). Uralchem and other suppliers are now aiming for well over $190pt fob.
Grodno: Grodno offered granular urea for February lifting this week and is understood to have rejected bids around $200pt fob. The company will reoffer the 20,000t in a new sales tender 5 February.
Phosagro: Nitron is loading 10,000t with other products for ec Mexico. The urea is understood to have been booked around $190pt fob..
Uralchem: 5,000t of prills have been sold to Nitron around $192pt fob for shipment with Mendeleevsk granular to Canada.
SBU: 10,000t have been sold to Helm for Europe at a reported $190pt fob and 25,000t to Yara at $185-190pt fob. SBU has also sold an early March cargo to a trader for Africa in the same price range.
Africa/Mediterranean
Egypt: The MOPCO complex at Damietta could be down for 2-4 weeks following an explosion affecting a gas pipeline on 25 January. The complex comprises three granular urea plants.
Other producers are also understood to have faced disruptions to gas supplies. AFC and HFC have resumed production while OCI was reported to be operating at 70% this week. Some also attribute the gas outages to the late arrival of an LNG vessel.
As news of the disruption has spread, coupled with the reports from Algeria, see below, prices have advanced. OCI is understood to have sold granular earlier this week at or just over $215pt fob to a trader for shipment to Europe but has now raised its prices ideas. Trammo and Helm have since bought from HFC at $224pt fob.
Algeria: AOA has both urea lines down. One unit is expected to restart shortly. Helm is in the freight market for 8,000t of urea from Arzew to Brake, Germany loading mid-February. Sorfert achieved premiums of $6- 7pt for over Egypt for its February tonnage.
South America
Venezuela: One spot cargo appears available for end- February which could head to the USA or Brazil. Earlier a cargo was thought to be destined for Chile, but latest reports indicate that this has been cancelled. A cargo is being shipped to Colombia this month.
Urea Supply – East
Middle East: Granular urea prices have bounced back with higher netbacks possible in Brazil and the USA and a spot cargo sold to Europe over $200pt fob.. Latest offers into Brazil reflect close to $195pt fob. US netbacks are higher with March barge prices reflecting $205pt fob or above.
∙Qatar: Three shipments to the USA are expected in February. Two are possible to Thailand, one via Pepfert. Ameropa has a late February cargo for Brazil. No other Brazilian shipments appear planned.
∙Oman: Nitron has purchased 20,000t at $197pt fob for shipment to Argentina and Uruguay with DAP and MAP from Saudi Arabia. SIUCI is aiming for $200pt fob for March. Keytrade is in the freight market for 35,000t to the US Gulf, loading mid-February.
∙UAE: Further to last week 11,000t will be shipped to Sudan at a reported price over $220pt fob, this under a previous sale.
Kuwait: PIC has sold 25,000t for February/March shipment in the low-$200s pt fob. The product is for
Europe. Liven is understood to have a cargo to load this month for Thailand. There are also reports that a cargo of granular urea may be shipped to the US west coast.
∙Iran: It is understood that export availability will be limited into March. This could be related to gas supply cutbacks which often occur in winter. A trader has one spot cargo of granular to load later in February.
Middle East Export Sales February
China: Ahead of the New Year break Chinese prices have held. A trader has covered a February shipment to Taiwan around $200pt fob (prills) and both prilled and granular producers are now at $195-200pt fob. A positive for suppliers has been an increase of Rmb 100pt in the domestic market. While port inventory remains high, buying for spring application is expected to build after the New Year break which could reduce the need for producers to keep sending large volumes to the ports.
Latest developments
∙A cargo of granular urea has been sold for Mexico around $195pt fob.
∙Fudao is expected to shut at least one granular urea line for turnaround in March/April.
Indonesia: There are no moves to place urea with the new management at Kaltim considering a switch to more ammonia. The latest price in South Korea, would reflect over $300pt fob for ammonia. The urea price sought is $230pt fob to cover current costs based on $5.50-6.00/mmBtu gas.
Urea Demand - West
Europe/Med
France: Trader offers have moved up for March from €225pt FCA French Atlantic bulk to €228pt FCA bulk and above. A number of offers have been withdrawn this week. The increases are attributed in part to concerns over the supply situation in Egypt.
The latest gains for the Euro, trading at €/$1.11, are also providing support to prices and importers/buyers to move for new product.
Turkey: It has been a slow week in Turkey with buyers focusing efforts on non-nitrogen based fertilizers. Offers into Turkey have increased following earlier low-priced sales down to $190pt cfr southern Turkey (see last week’s report).
Turkey is normally a major buyer for March-May arrival with 2015 imports over this period around 450,000t of prilled and granular.
Gubretas closed a tender 4 February for 10,000t of urea for prompt shipment.
North America
US Gulf: Granular urea values moved up sharply mid- week and have settled in the $205-210ps ton range for February and March, over $15ps ton above concluded trades on Monday. The upward movement was bolstered by CF Industries acquiring barges for February and March. The activity led to speculation in the market of production issues at Donaldsonville although there has been no confirmation of this.
In terms of prices by month, February has traded at a high of $208ps ton, with March at $211ps ton. The latter reflects over $210pt fob Arab Gulf, still above what is possible in other markets for Middle East granular urea.
Prospects for prices over the coming month are dependent on the willingness of buyers to secure product ahead of the spring season at current levels. The US remains a premium market and could still attract some further tonnes for March arrival. However, the additions would not be massive as Europe and, to a lesser extent, Brazil are also competing for remaining February loaders.
Looking further ahead, Q2 physical barges have traded in the mid-$190s ps ton this week.
Imports: There have been no additions to the import line-up for February and March. The estimated total through end March is still lagging 2014/15.
US Gulf/ec Gran Urea Imports 2015/16
CF-CHS deal: CHS has begun taking product from CF Industries under its previously announced $2.8 billion strategic venture. From the start of this month CHS is entitled to purchase up to 1.1 million short tons of granular urea and 580,000 short tons of UAN annually from CF Nitrogen. The volume represents approximately 8.9% of CF’s total production capacity once expansion projects are completed at Donaldsonville, La., and Port Neal, Iowa, all expected in 2016. The new urea plant at Donaldsonville is already running.
Corn: Corn values are up on last week with March contracts around $3.73($.3.65/bu last week) and December at $3.95/bu ($3.87/bu last week) at presstime.
Canada: La Coop has been in the market for 20- 25,000t of granular urea for March shipment. It is understood to have bought at $215pt cfr reflecting $190 pt fob Baltic. Nitron has been linked with the business.
Latin America
Brazil: Offer levels of granular urea have increased with product loading February in the Middle East now quoted at $205pt cfr. One sale has been made at $200pt cfr.
Fertipar and Herringer are still looking for February
tonnage while Yara is also understood to require granular as there is no shipment from Qatar. Against these inquiries there is little product available as recent low prices and better returns from the USA have limited the flow to Brazil from the Middle East.
Further to last week, it is now understood the full cargo sale to Fertipar at $185-190pt cfr is for March through June shipment.
Mexico: The Buying Group closed a tender 4 February for 25,000t of prilled or granular urea for shipment February to 3 ports ec Mexico. In addition, a smaller group of buyers is expected to announce a tender shortly for a prilled urea cargo.
Other Mexican inquiry is evident but Pronamex and Agrogen are aiming for very low, unworkable numbers below $190pt cfr. Higher prices will have to be paid if February tonnage is required.
New Zealand: Urea imports were 598,000t in 2015, 10% ahead of 2014.
UAN Solutions
UAN prices remain subdued. However, as with urea, prices in Europe should soon find a floor for the spring as levels in the low to mid-$160s pt cfr France equivalent are low.
In the US barge prices are assessed around $150ps ton fob Nola although terminal levels reflect higher levels. Should the improvement in urea be maintained UAN prices could find support above the paper market business concluded for March in the low-$140s ps ton fob.
$ps ton fob Nola
US Gulf Nitrogen
Honduras: Fertica is in the market for a granular urea cargo.
Guatemala: Incofe is expected to enter the market shortly for 25,000t of urea.
Urea Demand - East
Asia/Pacific Rim
India: Of the 1.5m. tonnes awarded under the last IPL tender, around 160,000t of urea are reported to have been rejected owing to late shipment, loading or quality issues. This includes cargoes from Iran and China. At least one cargo is understood to have been diverted.
South Korea: The Pungnong tender for 6,000t of granular urea for shipment by 20 February is reported to have been awarded in the mid to high-$180s pt fob China equivalent.
Kg Chemical has booked 3,000t of Chinese granular just below $200pt cfr. Dreymoor has been linked with this and the Pungnong award (6,000t). The Kg price reflects the mid-$180s pt fob China.
Dongbu’s 3 February tender for 6,000t of granular urea for March shipment is reported to have brought offers below $185pt fob China equivalent. A second round closed 4 February.
Malaysia: The Nafas inquiry for 6,000t of prilled urea was awarded to Golden Barley ex-China at a reported $201pt cfr Penang reflecting $184-185pt fob after freight.
Thailand: Sak Siam has purchased 20,000t of granular from Liven around $196pt cfr. This is understood to be for shipment from Kuwait.
France: UAN has dipped to just below €150pt FCA Rouen for March/April, around $164-165pt cfr basis the stronger US dollar Euro rate. €140pt FCA is quoted for the new season, June-September.
Baltic: Achema is expected to resolve catalyst problems and resume production at the end of February. Grodno is moving all product to the domestic market and has no export tender planned at this stage. Agronova has fixed a vessel to load 33,000t prompt for the US east coast.
US Gulf: UAN is put at around $150ps ton fob Nola but with no business to report. Upriver prompt tonnage is being offered at $155ps ton fob. East coast prices are put at $160-165pt cfr but with no sales to report.
Eurochem is loading 30,000t of UAN in Novorossisk for the US east coast, fixed around $34pt.
Canada: Inquiries for UAN are surfacing for arrival end March onwards.
Argentina: Nitron has sold a cargo of CF Industries UAN to Bunge at around $175pt cfr reflecting an estimated $135pt fob US Gulf.
Nitrates/Sulphates
Russian AN is being indicated at $180-185pt fob, although some sources believe $175pt fob is possible. While prices are down AN is still at a high value versus urea.
Amsul prices are holding in China at $105-110pt fob with steel grade around $100pt fob for good quality. FSU product is put at $100-110pt fob but there is little available with most product moving domestically.
Baltic: AN prices are now put at $180-185pt fob, down from $195pt fob in January. Nitron will load a cargo of Acron AN and urea for Central America and Ecuador.
A freight inquiry is circulating for 25,000t of AN Riga- Brazil loading 15-18 February.
Turkey: Inquiry is evident for AN but buyers are indicating very low prices and no sales have been reported.
Ammonia
While no major changes to ammonia prices have been evident in the West this week, the market has weakened in Asia with a sale to South Korea concluded at $347pt cfr. The price reflects well below $300pt fob Middle East although the product will come from Australia.
In the West there have been no new price tests with Black Sea prices put at $260-265pt fob. However, the vessel line-up at Yuzhnyy is thin while the Baltic is also long. Both areas have lost February business to Trinidad/US product and prices are expected to weaken.
Yuzhnyy: Prices are unchanged. However, the export line up for February is not full and some pressure to move second half February product could emerge. OPZ continues to run one line and has no plans to restart the unit this month.
∙The Clipper Orion for Koch is heading to South Korea and Taiwan
∙The Solaro is en route to Yuzhnyy to load around 20 February. The destination is understood to be Tunisia (Ameropa contract).
The line-up for February is below. Around 157,000t loaded in January.
Turkey: Bagfas will enter the market for 10,000t of ammonia for mid-February shipment.
Egypt: Trammo will load the Marycam Swan in Egypt with Abu Qir product.
Algeria: Fertial has one ammonia line down as the lack of shipments to Fertiberia Spain resulted in inventory pressure. With a problem over export licences now resolved, the Andesgas will load shortly in Arzew for Spain.
Baltic: All producers have February tonnage to place. Poland also has one cargo available. Prices are under pressure with sales below $270pt fob expected for Russian product.
USA: The Gaschem Stade will load a cargo of CF ammonia shortly for Trammo for Morocco.
Trinidad: The Nashwan is en route to Trinidad to load a cargo of ammonia, presumably for OCI Netherlands.
Brazil: Further to last week, Trammo will load a cargo of ammonia on the Tobolsk for South Africa. The vessel is en route from Morocco.
Middle East: Sabic Saudi Arabia is under stood to have spot tonnage available for February/March.
South Korea: Namhae purchased 25,000t of Australian ammonia from Yara ex-Australia at $347pt cfr. Koch has the Clipper Orion en route to SFC with product also intended for Taiwan.
Indonesia: The CJ Indonesia tender for 6,000t of ammonia was covered by Gresik at $368pt cfr.
India: FACT retenders 5 February for 7500t.
