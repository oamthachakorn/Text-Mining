ANALYSIS
Market reaches a crossroad as price direction unclear
The ammonia market is at a crossroad with market participants unsure as to future price direction.
Indications from the Black Sea that Group DF will restart ammonium nitrate output at its Ukraine Cherkassy and RivneAzot units after a brief interruption using imported ammonia from its Russian Rossosh facility have prompted some to foresee supply tightness going forward. This is compounded by Koch’s repeat 40,000 mt purchases from the Black Sea and Baltic, rapidly absorbing any spare spot availability.
It is unclear whether the reported issues at Koch’s US facilities driving this activity will continue beyond July. Additionally the removal from the merchant ammonia market of Rossosh tonnage, which has limited outlets due to US and EU sanctions, might not have as much of an impact as initially feared.
NF Trading’s central customer of late OCP has diversified its ammonia suppliers and has recently secured a supply agreement with OPZ, also using the Gaschem Stade on a regular basis. Ameropa in turn is easily covering Koch’s demands and is supplying 40,000 mt on the Jenny N this month at a reported $380/mt FOB keeping prices stable.
Additional supply west of Suez is easing upward price pressure with Turkey’s Gemlik selling a small parcel to Yara in the low $400s/mt FOB. The Turkish tonnage enters the EU free of duty. Ameropa meanwhile fixed a dutiable cargo with Yara out of Sillamae some $10/mt lower. Algeria also reported that its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants have returned to commercial output after shutting down May 17 due to technical problems.
East of Suez jitters are noted in anticipation of the Safco V urea plant start-up expected at the end of June and the resulting removal of substantial merchant ammonia volumes from the market. Further production issues at the Malaysian Petronas ammonia unit and a recent temporary shutdown at Yara’s Pilbara facility likely prompted Mitsui to pay $437.50/mt FOB in Kaltim’s 20,000 mt June 11 ammonia tender, $26 above the supplier’s reserve price.
Indian buyers are enquiring about spot availability from the Far East with regional traders to help mitigate against potential sharp price increases from Middle East producers from July. Recent Indian spot sales have been made by Trammo in the mid $400s/mt CFR with Tata and SPIC. Buyers will strongly resist further price increases given that demand is anticipated to be fairly lacklustre in the month ahead due to increased DAP imports of late. FACT rejected Trammo’s $515/mt CFR offer following its June 5 tender and will use ammonia from its own Udyogamandal ammonia facility which recently restarted.
In the US, despite improved weather ammonia seems to be losing the competition with UAN for much of the spot nitrogen demand for side-dress in the Midwest. The swing demand is modest as a function of total spring nitrogen demand, but it likely means more ammonia carryover this summer compared to recent years.
Expectations of a cheaper price tag at Tampa for July imports are growing among US Gulf players despite the relatively flat market overseas. July talks might get under way late next week.
Highlights of the week:
∙Ameropa supplies full 40,000 mt to Koch on Jenny N
∙Group DF may import Rossosh ammonia to run Ukraine AN
∙Igsas buys 7,000 mt from Ameropa around $410/mt FOB
∙Gemlik sells 12,000 mt to Yara in low $400s/mt FOB
∙Algeria restarts Sorfert I ammonia and urea units
∙Ameropa sells 8,000 mt to Yara out of Sillamae
∙Safco V urea plant set to start soon
∙Pupuk Kaltim sells 20,000 mt to Mitsui at $437.50/mt FOB
∙Trammo sells 6-10,000 mt to SPIC at $450/mt CFR
∙Tampa July negotiations may start next week
Short term outlook
Difficult to predict although prices in most markets east and west of Suez are believed to have reached a floor with the possible exception of the Tampa price to be fixed for July. Momentum to increase prices is slow although there might be a slight uptick in July.
Ammonia versus DAP
As Brazilian MAP shipments are at their peak and are expected to remains so through June and July, Moroccan demand for ammonia will remain firm. Going forward, much will depend on the outcome of the next round of phosphoric acid negotiations for Q3 in India and Europe which are due to start in the next two weeks.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.
MARKETS
AMMONIA
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Ammonia applications step up
Ammonia use for side-dress applications has disappointed somewhat this season due to uncooperative weather across the region. Application work is undeway, but the rapid growth of corn so far this season means UAN or urea may be required for some acres that typically rely on ammonia, due to application limitations. More aggressive pricing in prior weeks has helped, however. Ammonia postings are $590-615/st FOB.
US Tampa: Buyers aim for cheaper July imports
Mosaic and other importers of ammonia across the US Gulf are hoping for a cheaper price tag for imported ammonia in July. Some key overseas benchmarks that influence the Tampa price tag have been stable for several weeks, but US domestic values have fallen ahead of the normal summer fill market. Importers taking ammonia to the Midwest and to Texas likely would like to see a reduction in costs reflecting their reduced resale opportunities. The June price tag settled at $450/mt CFR Tampa.
US S Plains: Ammonia down as demand evaporating
Ammonia has almost no role left this season for crops in the South. Much of the nitrogen demand going forward is tied to the rice market, where only urea is employed. As a result some aggresive pricing is available to retailers willing to take positions now that likely will still be in hand when the fall season arrives. Recent spot offers are cited at $520-540/st FOB in Oklahoma.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic: Yara secures 8,000 mt parcel from Ameropa
Yara will load 8,000 mt on the Temse in Sillamae June 13 after fixing a deal with Ameropa around $390/mt FOB. The vessel will head to Finland for use within Yara’s own system.
Uralchem is still reported to have spot volumes available for July loading.
Black Sea: Ameropa supplies full 40,000 mt to Koch
Ameropa has now emerged as the sole supplier of 40,000 mt to be loaded on the Jenny N for Koch at the end of June. The cargo is believed secured around $380/mt FOB for shipment most likely to the US, with Taft as the intended port of discharge.
OPZ had initially been slated to provide 20,000 mt to Koch for the latest lifting. The supplier has now said one of its marketers Nitora will load 23,000 mt on the Gaschem Stade for late June lifting for OCP under an existing contract, after the vessel completes its prior voyage to Morocco with a cargo sourced from NF Trading.
Ameropa’s Gas Snapper is expected to arrive in Yuzhnny June 14 and will load 23,500 mt for JPMC in Jordan after a deal was fixed with Qafco’s marketing arm Muntajat. The transaction was concluded under a formula pricing arrangement.
Ameropa will also load 23,000 mt on the Sylvie June 20 under a product swap with Trammo. Trammo is currently loading a similar volume on the Clipper Mars.
Trammo is discussing purchasing another 25,000 mt from Black Sea suppliers for lifting on the Touraine in July.
It was announced this week that two of Group DF’s Ukrainian nitrogen facilities CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot will cease production of ammonia to conduct an overhaul of the lines. Scarcely any merchant ammonia was being sourced from either facility of late with production suspended late May owing to political pressure.
Ammonium nitrate (AN) output is reportedly resuming in July at both plants and as such ammonia will likely be imported from Group DF’s Rossosh facility in Russia. Rossosh is likely reluctant to agree to such a supply deal though.
EUROPE
Turkey: Ameropa sells cargo to Igsas
Turkish values are reported unchanged at $410-420/mt CFR with Ameropa selling 7,000 mt to Igsas at the lower end of the range. The cargo has already been discharged off the Gas Cobia.
Yara's Pertusola will lift the 12,000 mt it recently secured from Gemlik in the low $400s/mt FOB June 13.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Middle East: Muntajat secures Ameropa cargo
Muntajat has concluded a 23,500 mt deal with Ameropa under a formula pricing arrangement. Ameropa will load the cargo on the Gas Snapper for JPMC in Jordan.
Sabic reports that its ammonia plants are running well and that its Safco V urea plant is currently undergoing production trials.
Trammo will use the Berlian Ekuator and Brussels to lift the 23,000 mt it secured two weeks ago. The additional optional tonnage it secured will be lifted at the end of June.
Morocco: OCP in market for July/August tonnage
OCP is next seeking tonnage for late July/early August delivery and continues to push for values below $400/mt CFR.
Tunisia: Ameropa delivers less ammonia off Gas Cobia
Ameropa’s Gas Cobia will discharge just 16,000 mt contract cargo in Gabes in the coming days. This follows a brief interruption in AN production, reducing ammonia demand.
The Gabes plant is yet to re-start both sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid production due to irregular rock supplies.Miners have returned to work but deliveries of rock are still subject to sporadic sit-ins and blockades. It is hoped that a return to regular supply and therefore a return to phosacid and fertilizer production will be achieved by the start of Ramadan on June 18.
Algeria: Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up
Algerian producer Sorfert said its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants returned to commercial output June 8. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Buyers unsure ahead of Safco V urea start-up
Indian ammonia demand remains stable this week. Trammo revealed it sold 6-10,000 mt ammonia to SPIC at $450/mt CFR for prompt delivery to Tuticorin off the Tobolosk. This follows its sale of under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals for prompt delivery to Haldia last week.
Enquiries are reported from buyers seeking product for July delivery from Far East suppliers in anticipation of the Safco V urea unit coming on stream at the end of June, removing a substantial volume of Middle East merchant ammonia from the market.
This is despite recent indications that ammonia import volumes into India will be unchanged in the short term as high DAP imports over the past few months place pressure on domestic DAP output. It has been suggested that producers might increasingly focus on NPK production which may require less ammonia than DAP, depending on grades produced.
Future Indian demand will largely depend on the phosphoric acid price fixed for Q3. OCP will begin negotiations over the price level in the next fortnight. Indian buyers will be seeking a decrease in price versus Q1 and Q2 while OCP is likely looking for at least a rollover. If the price is reduced, domestic DAP production should pick up.
Rupee depreciation and monsoon concerns will likely continue to temper demand from the industry going forward.
India: FACT scraps latest ammonia tender
FACT scrapped its ammonia June 5 import tender for 7,500 mt due to the high priced offer received. Delivery had been requested for June 26-30 arrival at Cochin.
Trammo submitted an offer at $515/mt CFR, at least $65/mt higher than the current India price index.
FACT is not expected to retender given that its Udyogamandal ammonia facility restarted production early June after a temporary closure due to a lack of gas supply.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Malaysia: Petronas restarts ammonia facility
Malaysia’s Petronas ammonia facility has reportedly restarted after a three week shutdown due to technical
issues.
South Korea: Namhae and SFC receive spot offers
A number of suppliers have contacted Namhae and SFC over the past week to gauge interest in spot cargoes for July delivery.
Namhae and SFC have limited tank space for additional cargoes before August due to contract commitments but should price offers be competitive, they may consider small parcels in July. The buyers consider values at $440-450/mt CFR attractive given Mitsui’s recent Kaltim purchase at $437.50/mt FOB.
Namhae will receive a total 33,000 mt contract cargo before the end of June from Mitsubishi, Yara and Trammo and a similar volume in the first half of July from Mitsubishi and Marubeni.
SFC has 31,000 mt contract volume arriving before the end of June from Sabic and Koch.
Indonesia: Kaltim awards tender to Mitsui
Kaltim has awarded its June 11 tender for the sale of 20,000 mt ammonia to Mitsui at $437.50/mt FOB for loading end June. Trammo bid at $420/mt FOB and Fertzcomm at $380/mt FOB. The cargo will be taken to the Far East, likely for use against a mix of contract and spot business.
CJ Indonesia has issued another 6,000 mt import tender for July 28-30 arrival closing June 16. The buyer’s May 25 tender was awarded to Yara at $437/mt CFR.
Taiwan: CPDC could secure additional tonnes in August
CPDC will delay attempts to secure cargo outside contract commitments to August arrival due to full ammonia storage tanks at present.
Iran’s Raintrade will likely deliver a 10-15,000 mt spot cargo to CPDC during August although negotiations are on-going. The buyer is targeting values around $430/mt CFR following Yara’s sale to Namhae at that level several weeks ago.
Contract values are pegged $10-15/mt higher with Mitsui expected to discharge a total 15,000 mt off the Gas Quantum and Gaz Millennium late June.
Mitsui may discharge an additional 23,000 mt late July/early August for CPDC. It is possible that 15,000 mt will be delivered under contract with the balance sold as spot.
