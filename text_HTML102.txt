ANALYSIS
Latin American nosedives could spread
The significant drop in granular urea values in Latin America this week was not a surprise, but was more severe than expected by many. The impact is likely to be felt by suppliers from most sources, but the main question faced by producers, endusers and traders is whether US prices will adjust down by a similar factor or if that market will provide a safe haven for cargoes seeking a home.
While nowhere near the $80/st collapse in US barge numbers last week, the $20-22/mt drop in Brazilian CFR numbers occured in a market that was already substantially below delivered prices into the US Gulf.
Freight to Brazil and the US Gulf from the Middle East do not differ substantially. The $290/mt CFR deal booked in Brazil this week would therefore reflect barge values in the US no higher than $270/st FOB. This is substantially below even the more pessimistic outlooks for July. Trades in August barge-tonnage and beyond in the US have however been concluded in the mid-$280s/st FOB, suggesting a distinct possibility of convergience for CFR values in Brazil and the US Gulf.
The aforementioned $290/mt CFR price for Brazil did grab the attention of US traders. Indications for August and September barges moved down from the high to low $280s/st FOB New Orleans late this week. However, the biggest difference in coming weeks for the US Gulf should be the elimination of the large price spread as cargos now are making up for the supply shortage seen during most of June.
It may of course be argued that this week's sales of Middle East granular urea in Latin America do not representy the actual market and that the disposal of length was out of desperation rather than rational business decisions. Importers' ability to hold off on additional purchases on the back of significant existing inventory do however suggest that this week's sales may be difficult if not impossible to repeat in the short term.
The impact on other sources of supply will be significant if Middle East values were to stabilize in the mid $270s/mt FOB or even in the mid-$280s/mt CFR. The latter would imply offers for key destinations such as India back into the low $290s/mt CFR from the most recent sales above $315/mt CFR. This would in turn reflect Chinese netbacks no higher than $280/mt FOB and FSU Black Sea returns some $10-15/mt lower, depending on cargo-size and discharge terms.
Chinese sellers are already fighting an uphill battle to sustain netbacks at or above $300/mt FOB, and traders appear happy to short forward positions some $15/mt lower, as was evidenced via low offers in the
June 29 MoA tender in Sri Lanka that permitted shipment into September. Small sales of Chinese prills and granular in regional markets for July loading reflected similar sentiment.
Urea application on corn in China is about to end, and domestic demand has already tapered off from recent peaks, resulting in lower quotes, also for export. This suggests a return to export potential in excess of 1 million mt/month, a volume that will fight for outlets with product from other sources that are due to ramp up exports in coming months.
Highlights of the week
∙Brazilian prices nosedive to an even $290/mt CFR
∙Argentine importers book granular at $300/mt CFR ahead of Brazil deal
∙US barge-values heading closer to $300/st as short positions covered
∙Chinese supply limited to 425,000 mt in the STC session in India
∙Chinese prills continue to trade at par with regular quality granular
∙Kaltim books 360,000 mt granular urea to load by December in formula-deals
∙Prompt FSU prills trade in Turkey at netbacks in low $280s/mt FOB
∙Ukraine rejects Gazprom offer for gas at $247.18/'000 cbm at border
∙Sri Lankan MoA tender June 29 oversubscribed at $10/mt discount on June 9 session
∙Pakistan Kharif availability finely balanced but TCP tenders yet to emerge
∙Sorfert in Algeria running well, but AOA output is awaiting restart
∙Egyptian output still erratic as government cuts gas further
Short term outlook
Softer still, and global values may still need to be corrected from some origins. Trader length rather than producer inventories triggered the most recent corrections, but continued oversupply though Q3 leaves little room for a rebound any time soon.
Ample pipeline stocks in most key markets outside the US imply that importers can continue to hold the upper hand in negotiations. Pockets of short positions could conceivably result in some upward voltaility, but the overall trend points south.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
Canada, US Atlantic: Algerian cargo headed for 2 ports
A 25-30,000 mt cargo of granular urea from Algeria will load this month for Trammo, with discharges at Fairless and Contrecoeur.
Market sources indicate about 10,000 mt of the urea will discharge for Yara at the Canadian port. Much of the Trammo volume could be destined for Canada also by rail from Fairless. The price tag for the imports was about $325/mt CFR.
US N Plains: Dakotas not reacting with other markets
Forward offers of granular urea are proving too much for distributors to fight when it comes to prompt pricing in the Dakotas. Postings do remain at $370/st DEL in places, but dry weather has hampered demand even before cheaper fill urea at around $345/st DEL was offered primarily from Canadian suppliers in prior weeks.
It is not possible to replace granular warehouse positions at values that reflect prices in the US Gulf, Midwest or Southern Plains markets on a prompt basis. But dry weather in the region has led to disappointing sales in recent weeks, likely leaving retailers in a position to get through remaining seasonal demand.
US NOLA: Broad range emerges as expected
By the end of the week confirmed business for granular urea available within a prompt window were spread out between $315-352/st FOB New Orleans, with the high end reflecting business conducted just after last week's close. Efforts to repeat business at the high end of the range did not succeed, but further business occured around $338/st FOB and multiple trades in the $320s/st FOB also were reported for 1H July.
At the end of the week some traders were bidding around $300/st FOB for prompt barges but transactions at this price tag could only be confirmed on forward business.
For months forward expectations of sharply lower prices have not come to fruition at New Orleans, as prompt demand has supported higher sales than indicated by prior forward business. Some sort of downward correction still seems very likely for 2H July-August, but August indications through FIS in the $280s/st FOB and confirmed physical trades in the $280s/st FOB for the same months would suggest that the bottom of the market is not substantially below recent market lows.
Market rumours regarding the start-up of CF's urea expansion at Donaldsonville, Louisiana are focused on late September or early October, at least for commercial rates. CF has not commented on this speculation.
US S Plains: Truck prices come off peaks
Even though granular urea remains in short supply in the Southern Plains region, seasonal slow downs in demand have eliminated the peak prices seen in last week's market. This week Arkansas River quotes are $390-395/st FOB.
Travel up the Arkansas River by barge is beginning again. Early this week travel was limited to daylight hours only and tows generally were just made up of six barges, roughly half the typical load for tugs.
US Midwest: Late demand holding prices up
Granular urea has sold as high as $420/st FOB this week in the Midwest. Wet weather continues to force growers to choose urea for top-dress applications on corn acres rather than ammonia or UAN in some areas.
Nevertheless, urea demand in the region likely has little time left. Corn is reported to be silking in many areas. This is not unusual for the time of year, but it means the benefits of further nitrogen applications are reduced for the current crop. Weather-related delays to top-dress applications now mean some corn acres have not received the volume of nitrogen farmers might have preferred.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Colombia: Imports down
January-April imports by Colombia as ascertained by customs via GTIS of 109,000 mt were down by a full 35.6% on the same period in 2014. Imports from China were nevertheless up by 50% to 55,500mt.
Deliveries from Venezuela were off by 47% to 41,000 mt and arrivals from Russia were down by 70% to a mere 11,000 mt. There were no shipments from Trinidad and Tobago, down from 9,400 mt in the same period in 2014.
April arrivals of 38,000 mt were off by 35.8%, including 20,400 mt from China, down by by 44.6% and deliveries from Venezuela were off by 70% to 6,600 mt. Russia accounted for 11,000 mt, up from zero in April 2014.
Argentina: Nitron widely associated with new sales
Nitron is widely suggested as the supplier of about 30,000 mt granular urea from Oman to two buyers in Argentina. The price secured was around an even $300/mt CFR, and the trader has fixed a vessel which is due to load from Sohar in July laydays.
Brazil: Seller concedes $290/mt CFR deal
The "wait and see" attitude adopted by Brazilian buyers of granular urea has paid off, yet again. Importers cited abundant availability of offers significantly below last week's quotes at $308-313/mt CFR early in the week, and a part cargo of 8,000 mt was booked July 2 by a major trader with Fertipar at an even $290/mt CFR.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Activity at low ebb, but netbacks suffer
A 10,000 mt cargo sold by a trader for southern Turkey around an even $295/mt CFR July 2 reflected netbacks to producers at an even $280/mt FOB from Yuzhnyy, but the trader may have been disposing of a prior position at a loss.
Offers from producers in the low $290s/mt FOB earlier in the week were not eliciting firm counters from traders that cited netbacks marginally above $280/mt FOB in support of calls for lower prices.
While the Ukraine goverment reportedly set natural gas prices for the chemical industry for July around a $313/'000 cbm CPT border equivalent, and claimed that imports of gas from Russia would be suspended, the government had an offer on the table for Q3 deliveries this week from Gazprom at $247.18/'000 cbm CPT. The Ukrainian government did however opt not to go for the Russian offer, citing ample opportunities to secure gas from other sources.
May shipments from Yuzhnyy panned out a shade short of 100,000 mt. July nominations are so far limited to the 8,000 mt currently loading from OPZ for Koch, originally destined to Italy, but the vessel may be diverted to Turkey:
EUROPE
UK: Offers claimed abundant at low numbers
UK importers claim that offers for granular urea for delivery in July and beyond are still abundant well below GBP 230/mt FCA in bags.
A second large cargo of Algerian urea is to arrive in July off the Lucky Trader for Koch from Sorfert. Koch is also loading the SDS Wind with 7,000 mt from Sorfert, but that vessel likely heads for France.
A GBP 230/mt FCA suggests a delivered value around $320/mt CIF while freight from Algeria is estimated in excess of $35/mt for a regular-size carrier.
Turkey: Buyers aim for lower numbers
Trade in prilled urea in Turkey is slow, and is mainly restricted to industrial buying, including some quantities required for NPK production.
Quotes to importers in southern Turkey were down by more than $10/mt from last week's $308/mt CFR with 180 days, duty unpaid.
Mainstream buyers were aiming for cover around $295/mt CFR, also with credit, for prompt positions, and are holding off on forward requirements. One cargo of 10,000 mt was suggested booked July 2 at the $295/mt CFR number including 180 days.
France: Trade slows further and prices inch lower
Repeat sales of July positions have been concluded at €295-298/mt FCA, but buyers are aiming for €285/mt FCA for August and beyond. The €295/mt FCA reflects about $315/mt CIF, duty paid, with no provisions for margins and financing.
Trade in Mediterranen ports is also seasonally slow, with offers from inventory around €290/mt FCA for a $310/mt CFR equivalent, duty paid.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Saudi Arabia: Safco V urea further delayed
As highlighted in the July 1 news update from Fertilizer Week, the start-up of Safco V’s 1.1 million mt/year granular urea plant in Jubail has been delayed further.
Following production trials through June, commercial output at the facility has been pushed back to some time in July, according to a press release issued by the producer.
Middle East: Producers face further price-deterioration
Netbacks to Middle East producers on cargoes priced via formula moved down further this week while spot purchasing remained subdued.
Firm offers and a subsequent sale in Brazil down to an even $290/mt CFR and two deals concluded in Argentina at $300/mt CFR are indicative of returns back down in the $270s/mt FOB versus the low end of last week estimated at $290/mt FOB.
Importers in Thailand also maintain a "wait and see" attitude and are in no hurry to secure additional parcels of granular urea, and cite ample quantity in warehouses in support of calls for lower quotes.
Producers are generally quite comfortable into July, but traders holding contract length that are struggling to place tonnage in Latin America had no choice but to accept the low bids in Brazil and Argentina.
While also heading further south, barge values for vessels discharging in the US in the second half of July are assessed no lower than $300/st FOB this week. This suggests a delivered value close to $325/mt CFR for producer-returns marginally below $300/mt FOB. Trades in barges concluded for August delivery at $285-288/st FOB New Orleans are indicative of netbacks no higher than $285/mt FOB Middle East.
One Contract of Affreightment (CoA) for four to five cargoes of 40-45,000 mt loading from Ruwais for the US has been fixed in the very low $20s/mt and a second CoA is likely to be finalised shortly at similar numbers, also from Ruwais.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Pakistan: Kharif availability finely tuned
Urea offtake in Pakistan was 422,000 mt in May 2015, up by 3.3% on deliveries in May 2014, according to latest statistics from the National Fertilizer Development Centre (NFDC). The April-May Kharif offtake of 788,000 mt was up by 18.4% on the 666,000 mt delivered in the same period in 2014.
NFDC estimated urea availability in May 2015 at 745,000 mt. This included an opening inventory of 356,000 mt and local production of 389,000 mt. No imports were recorded in May. The May 2015 closing balance was assessed at 323,000 mt.
Domestic production for the April-September 2015 Kharif season was assessed at 2.45 million mt for a total availability including carryover and imports marginally above 3 million mt. Full Kharif offtake is projected at 2.9 million mt, indicative of an opening inventory ahead of Rabi of a mere 102,000 mt.
Kharif imports are projected at 341,000 mt, inclusive of the 91,000 imported in April. Dreymoor and Samsung are each supplying 50,000 mt via awards in the May 29 and June 1 TCP tenders, and TCP is expected to tender shortly for the 150,000 mt cleared for import by the Economic Coordination Committee in June.
Sri Lanka: Transmart offers lowest in both MoA tenders
The June 29 MoA tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 12,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags for September distribution in Sri Lanka attracted offers from 13 traders. Offers for granular were submitted for 420,000 mt and offers for prilled or granular totaled 180,000 mt.
Transmart offered the lowest price in both sessions on both a 270 and 180 day credit basis.
Prices ranged from $336.29/mt CFR to $359.00/mt CFR for the granular and from $335.29/mt CFR to $364/mt CFR for the prills, all inclusive of 270 days credit.
Transmart's price for the 36,000 mt granular was $336.29/mt CFRFO with 270 days credit with Chinese product.
Trammo and Agri Commodities submitted the next two lowest offers at $336.75 and $337.00/mt CFRFO with 270 days respectively. Trammo offered Indonesian/Chinese product.
Transmart was also the lowest for the 12,000 mt prills/granular at $335.29/mt CFRFO with 270 days offering Uzbek product. The next lowest in this session was Dragon Fertilizers with Chinese at $338.13/mt CFRFO followed by AgriCommodities with Chinese at $340.50/mt CFRFO both with 270 days.
The total cost package for material originating from China is assessed around $52/mt for freight, bags, bagging, financing and reloading suggesting netbacks in the mid $280s/mt FOB, some $10/mt below the lowest offers in the June 9 tender.
Imports of urea into Sri Lanka in April identified by cutoms via GTIS in April of 61,000 mt were up by 58.6% on the prior year. Deliveries from the UAE accounted for 35,600 mt with the balance emanating from China.
January-April imports of 138,400 mt were nevertheless down by 8.6% on the prior year, but deliveries from China were up by 353% to 103,000 mt. UAE arrivals were off by 66% to the 35,600 mt imported in April.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
New Zealand: No new deals and May imports very low
There have been no new sales of urea reported since the Trammo sale to Ballance pursuant to the June 17 negotiations. May imports identified by customs via GTIS were meanwhile limited to a mere 1,500 mt, down from 51,000 mt in May 2014.
January-May imports of 183,000 mt were also lower, but only down by 8.6% on the prior year. Arrivals from Saudi Arabia of 123,000 mt were down by 48% while deliveries from China of 29,600 mt were up by 9%. Shipments originating in Malaysia of 26,600 mt were up by 61%.
Thailand: Urea buyers still appear in no hurry
Importers in Thailand concede that there is demand for additional tonnage, but buyers continue to decline offers into the low $310s/mt CFR. Indications of possible interest in spot positions are in line with Brazilian bids well below $300/mt CFR, but sellers are holding out for better returns.
Imports of urea in May meanwhile reached 310,000 mt, up by 25% on May 2014. Deliveries from Saudi Arabia accounted for 134,000 mt, up by 52%, and shipments from Kuwait of 61,500 mt were up from zero in May 2014. Indonesia suffered a major setback with deliveries dropping from 42,200 mt to a mere 3,600 mt.
The January-May volume of 861,000 mt was down by 3.6% on the prior year but delivereis from Saudi were up by close to 1% to 385,000 mt. Arrivals from Malaysia of 125,000 mt were off by 18% and Qatar lost about 9.3% with shipments of 124,000 mt.
Oman advanced from zero to 52,000 mt while China shipped 35,600 mt, a 38.5% drop. Indonesian arrivals of 33,300 mt were off by 50%.
Philippines: Demand expected to improve
Urea demand in the Philippines remains low, and trading is limited to small parcels of prills changing hand ahead of the rainy season. Replacement cargoes will need to be procured once movements to farms start in earnest, and volumes are expected to improve.
Sellers of inventory continue to hold out for prices in the $330s/mt CFR equivalent, but indications of interest from importers for forward positions are lower.
China: Domestic and export values slip further
Domestic and export values for prilled and granular urea tapered off further this week as the end of domestic corn application nears. Asking prices remained unchanged for prills around RMB 1,700/mt ($274/mt) EXW in northern provinces, but trades were confirmed down to RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) EXW and at RMB 1,570/mt ($253/mt) EXW in Henan.
Trades in prilled and granular urea in Shanxi were completed at par with last week at RMB 1,630-1,640/mt ($263-265/mt) FCA, mainly destined for delivery to ports for export.
Values for prills and granular delivered into ports were largely identical around RMB 1,700/mt CPT, indicative of an export price around an even $300/mt FOB for both grades, plus a margin for an exporter.
Repeat export-trades in prilled and granular urea are confirmed to traders short for prompt loading for India around $302/mt FOB, and in the high $290s/mt FOB for full July loading. Traders are however evidently convinced that forward coverage will be available at significantly lower numbers.
Sales in South Korea this week of 3,000 mt granular and 2,000 mt prills were indicative of netbacks in the low $290s/mt FOB, and the most competitive offers in the June 29 Sri Lankan tender reflected expectations of August and September availability at or below $285/mt FOB.
Indonesia: Kaltim books 360,000 mt granular urea
The Pupuk Kaltim tender for the sale of 360,000 mt granular urea for loading through mid-December to be priced via formula resulted in awards to four traders. The session called for bids for premiums to be paid on top of prices established via a formula.
The formula applies average published FOB values for granular urea in Southeast Asia and the Middle East for two weeks ahead of the date of presentation of Notice of Readiness by each carrier nominated.
∙Ameropa bid at a premium of $1.00/mt above the formula price and was awarded 150,000 mt
∙Koch bid at an initial premium of $0.80/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 90,000 mt
∙EuroChem bid at an initial premium of $0.40/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 60,000 mt
∙Dreymoor bid at an initial premium of $0.10/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 60,000 mt
Kaltim retains the right not to sell/deliver under formula allocations if the formula averages plus the premium agreed result in netbacks below the producer's minimum price. This will be calculated on the basis of returns achieved in the month prior to the actual month of nominations/planned shipments under the formula.
Swiss Singapore and CHS submitted bids in the initial round, but did not match the Ameropa proposal. The following declined:
∙Brio
∙Daewoo
∙Incitec Pivot
∙Indagro
∙Keytrade
∙Liven
∙Mitsui
∙Trammo
∙Yara
