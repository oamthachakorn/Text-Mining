ANALYSIS
Indian tender at centre of attention
The June 19 STC tender for an unspecified quantity of prilled or granular urea to load by July 27 attracted significant attention this week as producers and traders attempted to ascertain competition for the business.
Opinions on pricing in offers to be submitted in the tender vary substantially. Consensus is however building for mainstream numbers well in excess of $315/mt CFR for East Coast India (ECI) ports such as Krishnapatnam offering fast discharge terms. This based on expected FOB values above $300/mt FOB from China.
Higher freights for panamax carriers and the supramax segment are indicative of freights around $12/mt from northern China for the larger sizes, and some $2-3/mt more for supramax tonnage. Transaction costs are assessed at $2-3/mt for a package around an even $15/mt with very limited provisions for margins.
Availability from Iran to load by July 27 is assessed below 400,000 mt with costs likely to pan out around $300/mt FOB or marginally lower. Freight is estimated above $10/mt and suppliers of Iranian material also need to factor in provisions for insurance which is for seller's account acording to STC tender terms. This plus transaction charges and the extra costs of processing payments for Iranian material also point to delivered values higher than $315/mt CFR for fast WCI ports.
More aggressive offers from either origin can however not be excluded. Some traders point to added availability of Chinese urea in July as domestic demand wanes, and may elect to short the market down to netbacks available in recent small regional trades around $295/mt FOB, if not lower.
Offers for July positions in paper markets for Middle East tonnage posted at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at an even $300/mt FOB were attracting bids no higher than $295/mt FOB June 18, indicating that competitive offers to STC may also emerge from this source.
Limited availability through July from the Black Sea does not suggest competition from FSU tonnage, but offers based on firm quotes in paper markets for July positions at $288-290/mt FOB Yuzhnyy could conceivably match mainstream offers from China for WCI ports basis current freight estimates.
The US market is meanwhile also in traders' focus. Soaring values for prompt barge positions, already have attracted tonnage that had originally been planned for delivery to Brazil. Four cargos of granular
urea totaling about 110,000 mt previously expected to head for Brazil now are destined for the US from
Algeria, with arrival dates from June 25 to 2H July. The July lineup, fattened somewhat be delays in arrivals from June, has reached 900,000 mt.
This is despite declines in offers for 1H July barges. While barges confirmed for delivery before he July 4 holiday sold around $350/st FOB New Orleans, forward offers of physical tons for 1H July were available at $300-305/st FOB at press time. August offers were cited in the $290s/st FOB, and a physical sale at $295/st FOB was confirmed at press time.
Markets for prilled urea outside India have been less active as traders are unwilling to assume significant risk in adding length or going short ahead of the Indian session.
Tenders scheduled in Sri Lanka for granular and prilled urea and in Nepal for prills have attracted some attention while the upcoming sessions in Pakistan to procure a further 150,000 mt are yet to be announced.
Highlights of the week
∙STC tender June 19 at center of attention
∙US July import lineup reaches 900-950,000 mt, forward offers plunge
∙Chinese prills trade at par with regular quality granular, albeit via short positions
∙Sri Lankan MoA awards Dreymoor and floats additional tender
∙Pakistan tenders yet to be floated, but suggested imminent
∙Sorfert in Algeria running well, and AOA output also suggested restored
∙Brazilian importers maintain hard-line despite diversions of cargos to the US
∙Egyptian output still erratic but MOPCO II trials start
Short term outlook
Mixed, but bears outside the US have gathered a slightly larger following than bulls in recent days. Market direction will be clearer June 19 when offers in the STC tender are submitted, but quotes in that session are expected to be relatively widely spread. The general agreement for downward adjustments in granular values from recent US peaks is still apparent, but the timing remains an open question.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
Canada: Dry conditions hammer crops, cut urea use
Market expectations in western Canada have undergone a 180 degree turn and distributors are expecting substantially lower fill pricing in coming weeks. Just a month or two ago, railcars of urea were moving from the US for applications on canola and other crops. But severely dry weather since then threatens yields and warehouses in Alberta and elsewhere have substantial carryover granular urea.
US N Plains: Cheaper fill offers tug on spot values
Spot offers of granular urea for prompt delivery crept down this week to around $390/st DEL for trucks and railcars. However, more severe cuts in prompt pricing are likely given fill offers from suppliers for summer delivery from Canada and elsewhere.
Late season disappointment with Canadian demand has led to more aggressive pricing for summer granular urea by Agrium and others into the Dakotas. Offers are as low as $345/st DEL. This is down about $50/st from prior weeks. This price tag likely will be reflected in the prompt market for the Dakotas by July, if not sooner, according to regional distributors.
US NOLA: Trader shorts drive June sales, July weaker
Push almost came to shove between a few traders on some short sales that needed to be covered by June
15.Multiple sources report that a number of these deliveries had not been completed by close of business June 16.
Most or all of the transactions reported in recent days at $370-380/st FOB New Orleans are accounted for in efforts by traders to find prompt cover for H1 June shorts. Meanwhile, prompt granular urea barges available by the end of this month have sold as low as $343-346/st FOB, but most business appears to be in the $350s/st FOB this week.
By the end of the week, prior sales of early July granular barges at $350-353/st FOB were a memory, and H1 July business was cited around $310/st FOB and physical offers through the FIS service were down to $303/st FOB.
Prilled urea has sold at New Orleans this week at $310-315/st FOB.
China Oil's pamanax of Chinese granular urea will not reach New Orleans until the first 10 days of July, not in June as has been claimed elsewhere.
The spot lineups for the US June and July now also include 107,000 mt of granular urea divided between four cargos loading from Algeria. The importers are Ameropa arriving June 25 with 23,000 mt, Trammo
arriving June 27 with 30,000 mt, Indagro with 27,000 mt in the first two weeks of July and Koch with 27,000 mt in 2H July.
A rumored Gavilon cargo of Chinese granular for July arrival proved incorrect.
US S Plains: More rain coming, but prices rise
Granular urea truckloads have sold as high as $410/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River, even though another 5-10 inches of rain is predicted for Oklahoma and Arkansas this week. Texas already has seen heavy rains this week.
Urea prices are rising despite the poor weather outlook because retailers expect substantial demand wherever conditions permit as soon as the storm passes.
Predictions over when barge travel along the Arkansas River will return to normal are increasingly negative. Travel through to Inola Oklahoma may not be restored for at least two weeks, according to various distributors in the region. Meanwhile, distributors are reduced to buying truckloads from terminals along the lower Mississippi River as far south as New Orleans, and driving product 25 st at a time to enduser markets in Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Texas.
US Midwest: Wet weather prevents demand spike
Even though there is plenty of top-dress demand for corn yet to be satisfied, wet weather continues to slow applications. As a result pricing is far from keeping pace with recent spot costs out of the barge market. Early this week granular urea still was selling from river terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $370/st FOB, $5/st or more below FOB New Orleans quotes.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Diversions of vessels not alarming buyers
The diversions of vessels carrying granular urea originally intended for Brazil from the Middle East and North Africa to the US has yet to impact Brazilian buyers' willingness to pay up to secure additional material.
Offers in the low $320s/mt CFR tabled by sellers at the end of last week failed to elicit firm buying interest. Importers indicate that quotes marginally below $320/mt CFR are currently available, despite the
recent increase in freights for large carriers loading from the Middle East and other regional sources.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Belarus: Regional demand supports exports
While down on the March volume, April exports of urea from Belarus identified by customs via GTIS close to 6,000 mt were up on April 2014. The entire quantity was delivered to Poland.
This lifted January-April exports to 151,000 mt, up by a full 221% on the prior year. Poland accounted for 60,000 mt, Germany for 24,000 mt and Lithuania for 15,000 mt.
Russia: Exports of urea through April down by 19.3%
Competition from other sources such as China in Q1 saw Russian urea exports as identified by customs via GTIS drop by 19.3% to 1.39 million mt in the first four months of 2015.
The firmer stance on pricing adopted by Chinese sellers did however help to trigger Russian April exports of 364,000 mt, down by a mere 0.8% on April 2014. Deliveries to Mexico, partly replacing Chinese granular and Ukrainian prills of 49,000 mt were up by 68% on April 2014. Deliveries to Brazil were down by 3.2% to 42,000 mt but exports to Canada of 28,500 mt were up sharply on the prior year. Deliveries to Turkey of a mere 20,000 mt were down by 70% due to competition from China and Iran.
Brazil accounted for 277,000 mt out of the January-April volume, down by 14% on the same period in 2014. Deliveries to the US of 158,000 mt were down by 33.2% but shipments to Germany of 158,000 mt were up by a substantial 53%. Despite the April surge, Mexico accounted for 76,000 mt in January-April, down by 53% on the first four months of 2014. Deliveries to Turkey of 45,000 mt were down by 70%.
Black Sea: Traders hold off despite limited availability
Traders are in no rush to add Black Sea prilled tonnage for June and July despite lower offers from producers and marketers. Offers to secure repeat business in the low $290s/mt FOB have yet to trigger significant buying interest.
Paper markets are also indicative of subdued activity ahead of tomorrow's tender in India. Firm offers for July positions from Yuzhnyy that were posted at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $290/mt FOB attracted bids at $285/mt FOB while the bid-offer spread for August was $280-$285/mt FOB.
The lineup for June loading is close to 72,000 mt following the addition of the Dreymoor vessel to load for NF for Italy:
EUROPE
Spain: March imports up
Imports of urea by Spain identified by Eurostat via GTIS in March of 82,400 mt were up by 14.6% on March 2014, but Q1 imports of 307,800 mt nevertheless lagged Q1 2014 by 4.16%.
Russia accounted for 15,500 mt of the March volume, up by 174% on March 2014 and deliveries from Ukraine were up from zero to 14,000 mt. Arrivals from Germany were up by 108% to 22,200 mt but arrivals from Egypt were down by 72.6% to a mere 4,200 mt.
Algeria accounted for 67,400 mt out of the Q1 2015 volume, up by 146% on the prior year while arrivals from Germany were up by 24.8% to 46,000 mt.
Russia accounted for 31,000 mt and Ukraine for 28,600 mt. Deliveries from Egypt were down by 80% to 15,000 mt and arrivals from the UAE were down to zero from 30,000 mt in Q1 2014.
Romania: Q1 exports down
Romanian exports of urea continued to fall in Q1 2015, with the 44,500 mt exported in the quarter identified by Eurostat via GTIS down by 77% on Q1 2014. March exports of a mere 12,800 mt were down by 84.5% on March 2014, and were shipped almost entirely to nearby, inland markets.
Serbia accounted for 19,500 mt of the Q1 volume, up by 52%, but other markets registered significant declines. Shipments to the US dropped from 51,000 mt in Q1 2014 to zero in 2015 and deliveries to Turkey were down from 37,600 mt to 2,900 mt.
Germany: Urea Q1 exports lower but imports are up
Exports of urea from Germany identified via Eurostat via GTIS were down by 5.8% through Q1 while imports registered an increase of 11.25%.
March exports of 76,200 mt were off by 12.5% and Q1 exports of 223,400 mt were off by 5.8%. The UK took delivery of 35,100 mt in the quarter, down by 23% while shipments to Canada of 33,000 mt were up by 50% and deliveries to Poland of 23,000 mt were down by 13.5%.
March imports of 87,800 mt were up by 22.8% on the prior year with deliveries from Iran of 19,700 mt up from zero and arrivals from Belarus up from 3,000 mt to 18,300 mt. Russia accounted for 16,700 mt, down by 45.8%.
Q1 imports of 257,000 mt were up by 11.25%. Russian arrivals of 98,000 mt remained in the lead, but were off by 4.5%. Deliveries from the Netherlands of 33,000 mt were down by 25% while arrivals from Belarus of 30,400 mt were up by 402%.
Croatia: Q1 exports down on 2014
Croatian exports of urea in Q1 2015 of 64,100 mt identified by customs via GTIS were down by 28.6% on the Q1 2014 volume. Serbia accounted for 28,600 mt, followed by Italy with 9,800 mt and Austria with 9,600 mt. Exports to Turkey were not registered in Q1 but these will appear April onwards following numerous small sales of prills, mainly to industrial customers.
UK: Urea imports up through April
Urea imports by the UK in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 44,800 mt were up by 43.3% on April 2014 and January-April imports of 323,500 mt were up by 44.2% on the same period in the prior year.
Germany accounted for 19,100 mt of the April volume, up by 45% on April 2014 while deliveries from Netherlands of 10,000 mt were up by 51%. Arrivals from Poland of 3,600 mt were down by 50%.
Russian arrivals in January-April of 80,400 mt were up by 142% and shipments originating in Netherlands of 57,800 mt were up by 42.3%. Deliveries from Germany of 51,500 mt were off by 3% while arrivals from Egypt of 27,400 mt were up by 5.3%. Arrivals from Qatar and Algeria of 24,200 mt and 24,000 mt were up from zero in the prior year.
Netherlands: Urea Q1 exports up sharply
Exports of urea from the Netherlands identified by Eurostat via GTIS in Q1 2015 of 607,500 mt were up by a massive 88% on Q1 2014.
March exports of 141,300 mt were up by 6.7%. March deliveries to Belgium of 24,000 mt were up by 27.7% and deliveries to Spain were up by 32%.
Belgium was also the biggest outlet for Q1 exports with 108,000 mt while Germany accounted for 80,000 mt, the UK for 76,400 mt and France for 68,500 mt.
Italy: Prompt demand tapers off as season ends
Demand for prompt positions of granular urea has tapered off in Italy as application for corn has essentially ended. Buyers are concentrating on vacation-plans rather than urea purchasing at present.
The flurry of activity in March and April is already reflected in March import data provided by Eurostat via GTIS. March urea imports of 113,000 mt were up by 32.8% on March 2014 with Iran taking the lead with 26,300 mt, up from zero. Deliveries from Ukraine of 24,600 mt were down by 10.4% but arrivals from Russia of 23,600 mt were up by 322% on March 2014.
Q1 imports of 246,600 mt were nevertheless down by 18.2% on Q1 2014. Ukraine accounted for 66,600 mt, down by 31.4% but Russia was up by a massive 485% on the prior year to reach 56,400 mt and deliveries from Iran were up from zero to 31,000 mt. Egypt continued to suffer from limited availability and saw shipments drop by 80% to 23,300 mt. Deliveries from China were up from zero to 17,400 mt while Croatian imports dived by 71.5% to 9,800 mt.
France: Trade in granular subdued and imports slow
Trades in granular urea in France remains slow as importers hold off on forward purchasing. Trades are suggested by suppliers around an even €300/mt FCA, but distributors contend that offers closer to €290/mt FCA are freely available for the summer months.
Imports of urea in April identitied by Eurostat via GTIS close to 160,000 mt were meanwhile down by about 13% on April 2014. Imports from Algeria of 25,700 mt were down marginally on March 2014, while imports from Oman and Kuwait jumped from zero to 24,000 mt and 21,000 mt, respectively.
January-April imports of 544,000 mt were down by about 11% on the same period in 2014 but deliveries from Algeria of 123,000 mt were up by 7.1%. Arrivals
from Russia of 72,500 mt were down by 43.6% and shipments of 52,500 mt from Netherlands were off by 31%. Deliveries from Egypt of 41,500 mt were down by 69%.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Algeria: Sorfert sees regular output, more nominations
Sorfert reports regular output of urea following the May closure due to technical issues, and the producer's shipping programme for June continues to build, albeit at a relatively slow pace.
Following shipments of around 100,000 mt in May, the producer has loaded/accepted nominations for six vessels for a total close to 75,000 mt from contract holders Indagro (27,800 mt), Koch (16,000 mt), Nitron (15,400 mt plus 6,600 mt), Keytrade (4,000 mt) and Helm (3,400 mt) to load in June.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Sri Lanka: MoA awards Dreymoor, issues new tender
The MoA elected to award the June 9 tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags to Dreymoor at the trader's lowest offers in the session based on 270 days credit. A new tender for 48,000 mt granular urea plus 12,000 prilled urea in bags is set to close June 29.
Dreymoor booked the granular urea in the June 9 session at $347.26/mt CFR and the prills at $345.86/mt CFR, both inclusive of 270 days credit.
The June 29 tender requests offers for the tonnage to be available in Sri Lanka for local distribution in bags by the end of September, and also includes a requirement for TSP and MOP.
Pakistan: Fertilizers exempt from added tax
Further to the June 9 update regarding the possible 1% increase in the import tariff for fertilizers for 2015- 2016, news from Pakistan indicates that the government has elected not to include Agricultural inputs - including fertilizers - in the proposed tariff increase. The tax on imported urea will therefore remain unchanged at 1%.
TCP tenders for the additional 150,000 mt cleared for import by the ECC are meanwhile yet to be issued.
India: STC floats urea tender to close June 19
The long awaited tender for urea by STC to complement prior IPL purchases was issued June 12. The session calls for offers for an unspecified quantity of urea to load by July 27. Offers are to be submited by 11:00hrs Indian Standard Time on June 19 and are to remain valid through June 23.
Indian urea producer National Fertilizers Ltd. has meanwhile reported that its 510,000 mt/year Bathinda urea plant in Punjab that closed down for maintenance May 11 resumed production June 7.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Corn application set to taper off
Domestic prices for prilled urea are relatively stable but are expected to ease into July when application for corn will end. Trades in northern China are reported at RMB 1,700-1,730/mt ($274-279/mt) EXW
while business was done in Shanxi at RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) FCA.
Offers for prills for export were available at RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main northern ports, indicative of an export value around $307/mt FOB plus costs/margins to intermediaries.
Trades into regional markets such as Taiwan and Vietnam were nevertheless reported at netbacks down to about $295/mt FOB, but these are widely expected to be short sales by traders expecting a softer forward market once domestic demand for corn application eases.
Trades in granular positions in Shanxi were concluded above those for prills, with parcels changing hands at RMB 1,680/mt ($271/mt) FCA, suggesting export values at a mere $3/mt premium on prilled values. Netbacks on recent export deals are around $307/mt FOB for regular quality while premium granular quality has traded again above the $310/mt FOB marker.
Inventories at ports are also stable on last week with about 300,000 mt indicated available for shipment from Yantai and Quinhuangdao with the majority in the form of granular urea.
Exporters and traders are busy formulating strategies for the June 19 STC tender in India that permits loading through July 27. Mainstream offers are expected to be based on netbacks to producers above $305/mt FOB, but some traders may opt to consider taking short positions at returns down into the $290s/mt FOB. Freights for the supramax and panamax segments are up further over the last two weeks, suggesting rates closer to $15/mt rather than $10/mt for fast ports on East Coast India.
New Zealand: Ballance in talks with suppliers
Ballance Agri-Nutrients has been in discussions with suppliers pursuant to a June 17 request for offers for around 25,000 mt granular urea for July shipment. A deal for the cargo to load from Malaysia or Indonesia has been suggested, but could not be verified with the importer at press time.
Taiwan: TFC awards June 15 tender
The June 15 TFC tender for 6,000 mt prilled urea for June or early July loading is reported to have resulted in an award to a trader offering Chinese urea around $318-320/mt CFR. The price suggested reflects a producer netback marginally above $295/mt FOB if loaded from a northern port in China.
Imports of urea in April ascertained by customs via GTIS of a mere 7,500 mt were down by 60% on April 2014. Deliveries from China in April accounted for 7,300 mt. The April volume brought January-April imports to 35,600 mt, down by close to 50% on the same period in 2014, with China supplying 34,700 mt.
Vietnam: More Indonesian granular urea trades
Koch is linked with sales of about 20,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim production for June/July loading to importers in Vietnam. A further deal for 10,000 mt is being negotiated.
Exact details on the transactions were not released, but the sales were reported concluded marginally below $330/mt CFR, to be shipped in lots of 6-10,000 mt each.
An offer for Chinese prills are suggested available for a small 3,000 mt lot from a Korean trader down to $310/mt CFR while parcels of 6-7,000 mt are on offer around $315/mt CFR, in line with this week's sale in Taiwan.
South Korea: Namhae to test prilled values
Namhae will be seeking to improve on offers submitted to TFC in Taiwan for prilled urea around $317/mt CFR when tendering to buy 6,000 mt prills via tender June 19.
South Korean imports of urea in May 2015 registered by customs via GTIS of 56,500 mt, all from China, were meanwhile up by 3.5% on May 2014. This brought the January-May 2015 volume to 376,000 mt, up by 4% on the same months in 2014.
China accounted for 346,400 mt of the
2015 total, up by 24%, while deliveries from Qatar of 25,000 mt were down by 57.6%.

ANALYSIS
Firm UAN values prompt Abu Qir to issue tender
UAN
Continued, albeit slower, sales of UAN-30 at €196-197/mt FCA in France and leftover demand from Spain likely encouraged Abu Qir to issue its June 23 sales tender for 10,000 mt UAN-32 for prompt loading. It is expected to achieve returns above $180/mt FOB following 36,000 mt sales to Helm and Koch at the end of April priced just below that marker.
GrodnoAzot reportedly managed to achieve $170/mt FOB in its 25,000 mt June 12 export tender. Some tonnage is suggested destined for France while the balance will be loaded to nearby markets from the plant by rail.
US movement of UAN continues to disappoint, but the culprit still is wet weather. Assuming conditions improve again before the corn grows too tall, UAN applications still could meet expectations, but summer fill orders likely will be delayed while retailers and distributors are uncertain about their carryover volumes.
Ammonium sulphate
At least 36,000 mt caprolactam grade AS has been sold by Chinese suppliers to Koch and Trammo with some small container business to Ameropa this week. The Koch tonnage will likely be directed to Indonesia against previous sales to Gresik.
Petrokimia Gresik is seeking further product and has issued a tender closing June 22 for 10-15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for first half August arrival.
In the Black Sea steel grade AS values have declined at least $5/mt on a reported 4,000 mt purchase by Mekatrade. Turkey has been suggested as the cargo destination.
Eurochem has fixed a 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS ex-Antwerp sale into Turkey, possibly to Gubretas in combination with 25,000 mt DAP. No further details are known. Turkish caprolactam grade AS prices are pegged in the high $160s/mt CFR duty paid.
European caprolactam grade AS has been sold into Brazil at $175/mt CFR while Chinese product has achieved values in the high $160s/mt CFR.
Ammonium nitrate/CAN
FSU suppliers continue to aim for higher netbacks from key markets such as Brazil and Turkey, but sales around an even $210/mt FOB and marginally higher are so far limited to smaller parcels for North Africa.
Suggestions that Brazilian buyers had concluded parcles of AN in combination with phosphates and urea at prices providing suppliers with netbacks above $215/mt FOB for AN could not be verified.

US NOLA: Barges flat, but pressure from imports
UAN barge trades have not been the priority for up-river buyers due to continuing rain in the Midwest. However, once further demand emerges for corn application sales of full tows should re-emerge. As a result nearby indications are unchanged from last week.
Meanwhile, Agronova is loading 40,000 mt of UAN-32 July 1-10 from the Baltic for the US Gulf. The cargo is destined for Gavilon under a previously agreed supply arrangement. Market sources suggested the delivered price paid by Gavilon will result in a cost in a barge as low as $197/st FOB New Orleans..
US Midwest: Fill offers put pressure on prompt market
As expected, lower fill offers that include delivery dates as early as July have begun to drag down UAN values in the Midwest. Prompt UAN is on offer from some river terminals as low as $9.06/unit FOB this week, while even the high end of the market has fallen to about $9.38/unit from some inland locations.
The new prompt price range is down roughly $0.20/unit at both ends compared to prior weeks. This follows reports earlier this month of Q3 fill offers at $7.66-7.81/unit FOB in the region. While the volume available at this level is relatively modest, it means the prompt market likely will decline further as June comes an end.

Belarus: GrodnoAzot sells 25,000 mt UAN-32
Contrary to earlier reports, GrodnoAzot said it sold 25,000 mt UAN-32 following its June 12 export tender. The product to load onto vessels was reported secured at $170/mt FOB, destined for France while tonnage destined for Ukraine will be loaded from the plant by rail.

France: Values stable on small number of sales
Sales into France continue to be slow around the €196-197/mt FCA marker. Some traders continue to push for €200/mt FCA but so far this has not been successful.
Demand from farmers is expected to decrease over the next few weeks as their focus is shifted to harvesting the winter wheat crop. A lack of rainfall is causing some concern, with wheat and rapeseed yields in the central part of the country down 10-15% from last year’s high level with the potential to decrease further if rain does not fall over the coming weeks.

ANALYSIS
Market direction unclear as some prices firm
A slight firming in ammonia prices is noted on a perceived tightening of supply east and west of Suez. Future price direction remains unclear and a number of market participants are holding off from concluding deals in the meantime.
In anticipation of further purchases by Koch in the Black Sea and Baltic for July lifting, Yara has sought cover for 20,000 mt from several Baltic suppliers at an even $400/mt FOB, up $10/mt on the previous index. This was in response to a recent ammonia plant fire at Yara’s Brunsbüttel facility in Germany which affected its own supply chain. The impact of the fire remains unclear.
Black Sea activity proved calmer with no new cargoes believed traded. Netbacks declined to the mid
$370s/mt FOB in recent sales by Trammo into Turkey and Morocco with downward price pressure from both buying nations forecast to continue. OCP is still pushing for values at a $350/mt FOB Yuzhnny equivalent although Black Sea suppliers are so far refusing to accept the demands for lower prices.
Suppliers east of Suez have maintained upward price pressure with the presumed start-up the Safco V granular urea plant at the end of June certain to reduce available merchant ammonia volumes. As yet the vast majority of Asian buyers have resisted such price attempts, with South Korean buyers still claiming no interest in additional cargoes outside contract volumes until the end of July at the earliest.
South east Asian values have already noted a $11/mt uptick to $448/mt CFR following CJ Indonesia’s reported tender award to Petrokimia Gresik. This is likely a reaction to the high-priced 20,000 mt Kaltim sale to Mitsui at $437.50 FOB last week. It is suggested this cargo may be used against a reported sale to Orica around $500/mt CFR for first half July delivery.
Indian ammonia demand will be the key to future price development east of Suez. Satisfactory monsoon rainfall is being recorded for June but drier conditions in July could prompt a build-up of DAP inventories, possibly lowering ammonia demand. Negotiations on Q3 phosphoric acid prices are on-going.
In the US Gulf, CF is receiving ammonia through Yara that is enabling it to begin test runs on it new urea train at Donaldsonville Louisiana. That plant will run on imported ammonia until first half 2016 when the planned ammonia unit at the site comes on line.
Negotiations on the Tampa July price tag are yet to begin in earnest as both parties wait for the market direction to become clearer. Various sources have mooted a rollover from June’s $450/mt CFR Tampa price tag.
Fill offers for ammonia to be delivered ahead of the fall application season in inland US reported earlier this week by Fertilizer Week were fairly aggressive at around $540/st FOB in the Midwest from a limited number of suppliers. The pricing suggests suppliers have seen greater than normal carryover from the spring season.
Highlights of the week:
∙Koch still seeking Black Sea and Baltic cargoes
∙Trammo sells to Petkim in low $400/mt CFR
∙OCP buys 25,000 mt from Trammo in low $400s/mt CFR
∙Australia's Orica buys 19,000 mt from a trader around $500/mt CFR
∙CJ Indonesia awards tender to Petrokimia Gresik at $448/mt CFR
∙July Tampa price negotiations to start soon
Short term outlook
Furture price direction remains unclear with a combination of price increases and declines noted east and west of Suez.
Ammonia versus DAP
DAP production remains suspended at GCT's Gabes plant as rock supplies are subject to further disruptions, limiting ammonia imports. For July OCP is expected to place greater emphasis on MAP/DAP production over NPKs to cover commitments in Brazil and Europe although demand in Brazil remains extremely
subdued. Nevertheless, OCP will be hoping to balance granulation with steady Indian phosacid shipments but acid volumes will depend on the eventual price settled for Q3. Negotiations for this are ongoing.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices remain stable for the fifth consecutive week at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China, as sulphur and ammonia prices were overall fairly stable and expectations of oversupply have been tempered slightly in recent months.
MARKETS
AMMONIA
NORTH AMERICA
Tampa: July pricing focus of market attention
Mosaic is expected to fight hard for a further cut in the Tampa ammonia price tag for its July deliveries. Market watchers are predicting that flat pricing from the June agreement of $450/mt CFR may be the best Yara can hope for, even with more rumors of possible curtailments in August in Trinidad and Tobago . Expectations are for a Tampa July agreement next week.
US NOLA: Returns on ammonia barges down
Possible returns on ammonia barges and railcars loading for inland destinations from the US Gulf have declined, and are indicated within a substantially lower range than seen in prior weeks. Much of this decline is due to fill indications in the US interior that are $40-50/st lower than in prior weeks.
For now returns on spot sales up river and quotes based on import costs suggest a range of $430-$460/st FOB New Orleans, with the midpoint of the range declining about $35/st from prior weeks.
US Midwest: Fill offers cited below cash market
Distributors in the Midwest claim Koch Nitrogen is offering fill ammonia for delivery in time for the fall season at $535-540/st FOB terminals. This would be $50-60/st below cash costs for the current season, and reflects the bearish attitude reported from farmers and retailers for the upcoming crop year.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Baltic Sea: Yara buys 20,000 mt at $400/mt FOB
Yara has secured 20,000 mt ammonia from Baltic suppliers at a reported $400/mt FOB for July lifting. The cargo will be taken to Yara’s European units in Sweden, Finland and France after a fire at Yara’s ammonia plant in Brunsbüttel, Germany late last week affected its own supply chain. The impact of the fire is still unclear.
Koch is still reported negotiating the purchase of a further 40,000 mt cargo with Baltic suppliers for July lifting.
Black Sea: Netbacks down on CFR sales at lower prices
Black Sea trade has been extremely quiet with prices under downward pressure.
A recent sale to Turkey’s Petkim points to Yuzhnny values in the $370s/mt FOB while a 25,000mt Trammo sale to OCP possibly off the Touraine is reported providing netbacks in a similar range.
Trammo will lift a further 5-8,000 mt ex-DnieproAzot on the Marycam Swan late June or on the Touraine early July pursuant to a deal concluded several weeks ago around $390/mt FOB. It is unclear where the balance tonnage will be sourced from.
Trammo’s Sylvie which be loaded with 23,000 mt ex-TogliattiAzot June 26 under a product swap with Ameropa will likely be directed to buyers east of Suez under spot and contract business.
Koch is reported back in negotiations with Black Sea suppliers for a 40,000 mt cargo for July lifting. The trader's Jenny N will lift a similar volume June 25 for the US.
EUROPE
Turkey: Petkim buys small parcel from Trammo
Turkey's Petkim has secured 6,000 mt from Trammo for mid-July delivery in the low $400s/mt CFR. This is at least $8/mt down on previous sales done in the country to Bagfas and Igsas.
Bagfas is reported in the market for another 6-7,000 mt for July delivery.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Tunisia: Short term ammonia demand unchanged
Tunisian ammonia demand is unlikely to significantly improve over the coming weeks. There is still no reported DAP production as Gabes and rock supply is still subject to some disruption.
Morocco: OCP keeps pressure on Black Sea suppliers
OCP continues to push for ammonia cargoes below $400/mt CFR equating to a $350/mt FOB Yuzhnny netback.
Trammo's recent 25,000 mt sale to OCP off the Touraine for early July delivery was reported fixed in the low $400s/mt CFR.
Middle East: Scarce activity as Ramadan begins
Ramadan observance commenced this week with limited Middle East activity reported.
All Sabic units are reported running as normal. The Safco V urea plant continues to undergo trials and given no further updates it is assumed that full capacity production is still expected to start at the end of June.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Demand flat and prices steady
Indian demand is reported flat week-on-week with prices unchanged at $415-450/mt CFR.
IFFCO will take delivery of a 40,000 mt contract cargo from Ameropa off the Clipper Mars early July.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Australia: Orica linked to 19,000 mt spot purchase
Australian ammonium nitrate (AN) producer Orica has reportedly secured 19,000 mt ammonia from a trader around $500/mt CFR for first half July delivery owing to a technical issue at its plant.
Mitsui could conceivably be the provider of the cargo after being awarded Kaltim’s 20,000 mt June 11 sales- tender at $437.50/mt FOB for loading end June.
Yara’s 759,000 mt/year Pilbara ammonia facility is running normally after another technical issue interrupted production early June.
Taiwan: Buyers resist potential price increases
Taiwanese buyers report suppliers’ attempts to push prices up are gaining little traction.
Demand remains weak from industrial consumers while fertilizer usage will decrease over the coming two months during the off-season.
TFC received one 23,000 mt contract cargo discharged June 15 priced at $430-440/mt CFR with a similar sized cargo to follow July 20.
Indonesia: Petrokimia Gresik linked to CJ tender
An award in CJ Indonesia's June 16 import tender for 6,000 mt is reported to Petrokimia Gresik at $448/mt CFR. Delivery was requested July 28-30. The product will likely be sourced from Pupuk Kaltim.
The buyer’s May 25 tender was awarded to Yara at $437/mt CFR.
South Korea: Imports down on lower contract deliveries
South Korea ammonia imports for May down 14% at 74,030 mt reflect continued weak demand from industrial consumers.
January-May figures show an almost identical picture for imports, down 15% at 435,259 mt.
Contract ammonia deliveries have been reduced in 2015 owing to an expected decrease in demand with any urgent needs covered by spot purchases from Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Imports from Australia for the first five months of this year fell 1% to 179,548 mt while offtake from Saudi Arabia was down 71% at 69,617 mt. Imports from Indonesia climbed 26% at 52,307 mt and 196% from Malaysia at 47,372 mt.
South Korea: Additional cargoes still a possibility
Namhae and SFC report a quiet week in ammonia but suppliers seek purchasing interest in spot cargoes for the short term. Both buyers insist they will not consider additional parcels outside contract commitments until late July/early August at the earliest owing to current high inventories.
Contract prices remain unchanged around $450/mt CFR with SFC to receive a total of 23,000 mt from Trammo at the end of July in two shipments.

ANALYSIS
Subdued are the phosphate markets, east and west
With the exception of Pakistan where there has been a flurry of interest, buying activity has been subdued across much of the globe over the past week. In India and Brazil where both markets should be at the height of their import season, the impasse between buyers and sellers continues.
Pakistan has seen further buying interest this week with a sale from China and Saudi Arabia reported but with a higher price paid for the Chinese material, thereby bucking the normal trend. Much of the Chinese DAP coming into Pakistan is sourced from the Hubei Yihua plant and is well respected in the marketplace and the gap in price between the various origins is beginning to narrow accordingly. Firmer freights from China have supported a drive for higher prices also.
Although indicating higher prices in Pakistan and achieving some increase compared with previous sales, Chinese suppliers are unlikely to achieve a similar increase in India. Indian importers continue to put pressure on suppliers to reduce prices from the $480/mt CFR level by $7-10/mt to a range of $470-475/mt CFR. The rupee has been particularly volatile this week, spiking to INR64.3 at the beginning of the week to INR63.6 against the dollar at presstime today. The latter rate raises importers' margins at $480/mt CFR (and a MRP of INR 24,000/mt) from 1% to 2% but this still excludes any provision for hedging or interest payments against delayed subsidies.
Much depends on the monsoon but in theory India still has substantial tonnes to buy for the Rabi season despite the large quantities already booked to date. Low stocks and low production levels have prompted the greater H1 volumes of import tonnage booked. It can slow down its import programme and is likely to do so as it watches the monsoon but will not want to delay too late to avoid a similar situation to 2014 when a last minute surge in demand coincided with the Chinese autumn season and prompted a spike in
price. Nevertheless China, although currently in the peak export season with no alternative afforded in the domestic season or indeed much outside the Indian subcontinent, can play the waiting game also and it still remains to be seen who buckles first.
The Brazilian market remains very quiet as farmers assimilate the new Harvest Plan with its additional funding but with the higher interest rates that go with it. The weak crop prices are a real problem and with a higher cost of credit, farmers may continue to cut back on phosphate usage. This week's ANDA data make gloomy reading with a drop of 26% in consumption of P2O5 in May, the largest monthly reduction to date this year and well below the level of May consumption in previous years. Here buyers are also resisting suppliers' attempts to drive prices higher for July and the impasse is expected to last for another week or more before one or other caves in.
Mosaic will continue to ship to India, and presumably add cargoes for Brazil once a price agreement is found. However, the key for the producer remains the domestic market even though seasonal demand has been met. Mosaic is expected to begin railing refill tonnes to its consignment warehouses in July, and these volumes will reduce its need to search for further export opportunities. So far competing phosphates from China or Morocco are not on the radar for the US Gulf, although Russian suppliers appear willing to accept US returns on small volumes.
Highlights of the Week
∙Two new sales reported for Pakistan in mid-upper $480s/mt CFR
∙Lithuanian DAP sold into Turkey at around $510/mt CFR
∙Phosacid negotiations start but no agreement
∙Demand in South Africa as Moroccan and Saudi tonnes sold
∙Mosaic will refil US domestic maw over summer.
Sulphur
∙Global spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards march, with higher indications particularly from the Middle East and China. Tasweeq's latest 35,000 mt tender was heard awarded in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB, and Chinese deals were reported as high as $165/mt CFR.
Ammonia
∙Lack of clarity over price direction continues to stall ammonia activity. Despite weak demand east of
Suez, prices edged up slightly on CJ Indonesia’s reported tender award at $448/mt CFR.
Short Term Outlook
The Brazilian market continues to disappoint and although there are some still anticipating a last minute surge in buying for the September season, current economics would suggest otherwise with more of the same hand to mouth buying expected going forward. With US domestic prices also attracting no import interest for the coming months, the attention will focus on the Indian subcontinent to provide much of the activity over Q3 and probably the direction for the market. Both Brazil and India are needed to support the market during this period but without much impetus from either, prices may falter. So much therefore depends on the monsoon, even just from a psychological standpoint, as we head into Q3 and the start of the next round of import activity.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US S Plains: Wet weather halts further phosphate use
Soybean growers in the South are behind in their planting work due to flooding, and distributors predict many of those farmers will focus on planting before worrying about applying phosphate and potash. In some areas fertilizer applicators will follow the planters, but distributors do not report much demand from retailers.
Nevertheless southern states to the east continue to attract new sales to retailers, and prices have not moved at the distributor level in a couple of weeks.
US Midwest: Little movement expected ahead
Distributors do not expect to move much more phosphate in the coming days and weeks. Postings for DAP remain around $460/st FOB. Some barges still are discharging at northern terminals, and the supply chain in the region is ending the season with more carryover than normal, according to players throughout the region.
US Tampa: Modest interest does little to support market
Mosaic reported a further 17,000 mt of DAP sales this week to multiple Latin American markets. All of the material will load in July and was sold at $470-474/mt FOB Tampa, a $1/mt lower range than the prior couple of weeks.
Markets in the Americas are generally relying on Brazil to set the price for any large purchases in coming weeks, but buyers in that market have not been able to reach a meeting of the minds with suppliers on price for forward purchases.
US NOLA: Lack of interest in prompt DAP
Prompt inquiries are rare at this stage for DAP and MAP, although indications reported from suppliers are $415-425/st FOB. There is greater interest in forward DAP barges that would be available in the Gulf during September. However, at least one importer responded with bids basis open origin material at $440/st FOB for that month. So far there is no support for that price.
US: DAP/MAP exports slightly better than steady
US DAP/MAP exports during May were down modestly compared to May 2014, but not enough to change the trend for the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year through May with shipments moderately ahead of the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.
May 2015 exports of DAP/MAP were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared to 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5. Increases and decreases in shipments to traditional customers varied over the month, with the largest decrease seen in shipments to Canada, which fell to 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5 in May of 2014. The largest customers for US DAP/MAP in May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5.
For the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, DAP/MAP exports reached 1.98 million st (1.8 million mt) P2O5, compared to 1.78 million st (1.61 million mt) P2O5. Much of the year-over-year gain can be traced to shipments to India, which rose to 362,462 st P2O5 from 231,088 st P2O5 over the relevant periods. Other key customers for US DAP/MAP during the current fertilizer year through May were Brazil at 472,167 st (P2O5) and Canada at 287,065 st P2O5.
Mexico: Fertinal committed through to September
Deliveries to Chile and the local market through June, July and August mean that Fertinal remains fully committed through to September. Production continues to return to normal.
Fertinal is currently loading around 35,000 mt DAP, MAP and TSP on the Western Feodora for Chile. The balance of June production, estimated at around 70,000 mt and mostly DAP with some MAP, will be delivered into the local market, split between commitments of around 15,000 mt to NW Mexico and close to 20,000 mt delivered by truck and rail to nearby customers.
For July Fertinal will load another 35,000 mt combination cargo for Chile with a second such cargo, due to load end July/early August. The balance of July's production, estimated at around 70-75,000 mt, will be delivered into the local market.
An estimated 40,000 mt will be delivered into NW Mexico in August and a further 35,000 mt Chilean vessel will load either late August or September. Depending on the timing of this last Chilean shipment, a trader has booked 30,000 mt Mexican MAP/DAP for likely shipment to South America.
Production levels have been slowly but steadily improving, rising from a monthly output of 65,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP in May up to around 70,000 mt in June and a further increase in July/August expected to reach nearer 75,000 mt.
The increase has been in part facilitated by the two supplementary rock cargoes booked from Senegal, covering the shortfall caused by previous technical issues in the mine curtailing production but which are now being resolved. The first of these cargoes arrived on the Cano at the end of May and the second will arrive on the Ultra Iris at the end of June. No further imported rock cargoes are planned at this time.
Price levels for Mexican DAP and MAP have firmed up to $475-480/mt FOB with the higher price achievable in Chile where Fertinal has a freight advantage over other potential suppliers. Mexcian TSP is priced at around $385-390/mt FOB.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Import interest wanes and prices stall
The Brazilian import market remains very quiet with buyers resisting moves by suppliers to raise the price for MAP 11-52-0/12-52-0 above $500/mt CFR to $505-510/mt CFR, as is currently indicated for Russian and Moroccan product. As such the price range for this week has been assessed at $498-500/mt CFR.
OCP is currently in discussions with buyers for July shipments but as yet no tonnes have been placed.
Demand for Chinese 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 has started to ease off in China as few traders want to take positions for cargoes from mid July onwards for fear of both port congestion and demand worsening through August/September. As such prices in China for new sales of 11-44-0 for H2 July onwards have dropped off to $370-375/mt FOB giving landed prices sub $400/mt CFR depending on freight. For near term delivery into Brazil, prices are still in the low $400s/mt CFR.
YUC is producing granular 11-52-0, essentially for the Brazilian market, with its earliest shipment by the end of June and one cargo per month available through Q3 if needed.
Heavy congestion is being reported at Paranagua this week with delays of between 10-30 days reported at the fertilizer quays where a total of 24 vessels are expected, including 4 carrying MAP. At Santos, there is a
delay of 11 days with 10 fertilizer vessels expected. Delays at the fertilizer terminals at the other main Brazilian ports are currently less than 5 days.
Brazil: ANDA data show 26% drop in May P2O5 use
The latest ANDA data show a 19% drop in January-May P2O5 consumption with a 26% decline in May itself against 2014. The actual volume of P2O5 consumed over the full five months was the lowest since 2011.
Imports of all phosphate fertilizers into Brazil fell by 27% year on year January-May with DAP down by 36% and MAP, SSP and TSP all down by 26-27% compared with the same period a year earlier. The import volume for this period was also 19% down on 2012.
By contrast, Brazilian production of phosphate fertilizers rose by 4% in the first five months compared with the same period last year. Both MAP and TSP output increased by 7% year on year.
Looking at the demand/supply balance we can see that the availability to date appears to be in balance with demand. More costly credit lines and lower crop prices continue to cast a cloud across the whole fertilizer market. Brazilian corn prices continue to fall below cost of production levels, and are likely to move lower as
the safrinha crop harvest rolls on. This is likely to see full season corn planting fall yet again once fieldwork begins in September and will continue to impact demand across the nutrients.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
FSU: Turkish sale netback in mid $480s/mt FOB Baltic
EuroChem sold 25,000 mt Lithuanian DAP into Turkey for early July shipment at around $510/mt CFR cash duty free. With a freight rate in the mid $20s/mt, the netback is in the mid $480s/mt FOB Baltic.
Negotiations are ongoing for further sales into Turkey for July/August.
Sales to nearby and domestic markets have left Belorechensk sold out until 15-20 July. For Kingisepp, a cargo for mid July is now available. EuroChem is indicating $505-510/mt CFR for July shipment to Brazil. At current freights this would netback to $484-489/mt FOB Baltic excluding trader's margin but Brazilian buyers continue to balk at paying above $500/mt CFR.
EUROPE
Turkey: Sale of 20,000 mt Lithuanian DAP
EuroChem has sold a 25,000 mt cargo of Lithuanian DAP into Turkey for early July shipment, in combination with 15,000 mt AS. The price for the DAP is heard around $510/mt CFR duty free cash and the buyer, although not confirmed at presstime, is believed to be Gubretas.
Gubretas would normally be receving regular supplies from Tunisia at this time but the DAP plant at Gabes is yet to restart production after the two month stoppage. An initial 20,000 mt DAP delivery was supplied by GCT at the end of May out of stocks at the Tunisian plant but until the plant resumes steady production, further deliveries into Turkey will remain suspended.
Buying has been subdued in Turkey since the IFA meeting when a flurry of DAP and NP cargoes were booked. To date up to 280,000 mt DAP has been booked. Assuming that the full quantity of 100,000 mt is shipped from Morocco, a further 100-120,000 mt DAP is still theoretically required, ideally for Q3 shipment, and buying activity should start to pick up over the coming weeks. Cargoes from Jordan and Lithuania, both duty free, are likely to cover any outstanding demand not met from Tunisia.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Saudi Arabia: New sales to Pakistan
Ma'aden sold a cargo to Engro/Pakistan over the past week in the mid $480s/mt CFR for late June/early July shipment. As reported last week, Sabic also has a cargo booked for Pakistan, to United Agro, for July shipment, also priced in the mid $480s/mt CFR, giving an estimated netback into the mid $470s/mt FOB RAK.
Saudi DAP has become more competitive in Pakistan, priced at or even below prevailing Chinese prices from Hubei Yihua and as such, the Saudi market share has risen this year to just over 55% of the import market to date.
Sabic reports two sales of MAP for July shipment to South Africa both priced in the mid $480s/mt FOB. The first 25,000 mt cargo is for loading on July 3 and the second 30,000 mt cargo on July 15. Netbacks on South African business from RAK are currently more attractive than for sales to Brazil.
This brings Sabic's sales for July to date to 85,000 mt DAP/MAP excluding any cargoes to its regular customers in India. As such Sabic is said to be sold out for July and indicating in the $490s/mt CFR India WC and Pakistan for August.
Tunisia: Little change at Gabes
The latest reports suggest that DAP production is yet to resume at Gabes due to further disruptions to rock supplies. Even though rock production has been resumed at the mines, there are still pockets of unrest disrupting the transport from the mines to some of the downstream plants. GCT had hoped to restart phosphoric acid production at the complex by the start of Ramadan but this does not appear to have been achieved as yet.
Morocco: OCP targets Brazil and Europe for July
Brazil and Europe, including Turkey, will be the target markets for Moroccan DAP and MAP in July. Price indications for Brazil are in the range of $505-510/mt CFR whereas for Europe OCP is quoting the same range as for June, around $510-515/mt FOB Morocco.
As yet no sales for July have been booked in either market but OCP sold a second 30,000 mt MAP cargo to South Africa for end-June loading at a price said to be close to $490/mt FOB.
Demand in Southern Europe is starting to pick up and with no DAP currently coming out of Tunisia, additional sales opportunities for Morocco will be present over the coming weeks.
For the Turkish market, OCP booked the first 30,000 mt DAP vessel against its agreement with Toros for up to 100,000 mt for June-September shipment. The vessel will load end June/early July.
Plans to load an 80,000 mt MAP/DAP vessel to the US in July are still under discussion and will depend on demand in the US. Prices at NOLA are still unattractive to potential off-shore suppliers, equating to around $450/mt CFR.
As previously reported, OCP will ship a panamax to China at some time in Q3 against its government- government agreement but the actual date has not yet been fixed.
NPK sales to Nigeria are also under discussion for July and as yet no tonnes are believed to have been booked.
OCP will ship 75,000 mt TSP against awards in the recent Bangladesh private sector tender for Q3 shipment. As reported previously, the netback on this business is in the low $400s/mt FOB Morocco.
The new 1 million mt DAP/MAP plant is still in the commissioning phase and is still scheduled to start commercial production in early Q3.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Bangladesh: Awards dominated by China
Although the final supplier details remain unconfirmed, awards for the 400,000 mt DAP in the Ministry of Agriculture's recent private sector tender will be mostly covered from China. Just one cargo has been awarded to Quantum/Australia.
Netbacks for the lowest-priced DAP offered from the Hubei Dongsheng plant are sub $460/mt FOB, but this is not reflective of the Chinese market today and is believed to be a result of trader positioning rather than actual netbacks offered by the producer.
Most of the offers were at around $490/mt CFR which would give a straight netback to China in the upper
$460s depending on freight and excluding margins. The netback on the Australian cargo is reportedly in the low-to-mid $470s/mt FOB Townsville.
Shipment has been requested by September.
India: Imports reach 1.45 million mt DAP in April/May
The latest data released by the Department of Fertilizers show DAP imports for the first two months of the current fertilizer year, April/May, of 1.449 million mt. The breakdown by origin is as follows:
854,000 mt from China
338,000 mt from Saudi Arabia
172,000 mt from Russia
55,000 mt from the US
30,000 mt from Jordan
In terms of importers over the April/May period, IFFCO and IPL received 383,000 and 279,000 mt respectively or some 46% of the total to date. Chambal, Kribhco and Zuari each took between 138-165,000 mt with the balance accounted for by TCL, Mosaic, Deepak, Shriram, PPL, MCFL and CIL.
In terms of NP/NPK imports over the same two month period, IPL imported 124,000 mt with Deepak and Kribhco at 44,000 mt and 38,000 mt respectively.
Of this total, 148,000 mt NP/NPKs were sourced from Russia and the balance of 58,000 mt from China.
India: Up to 2.5 million mt DAP imports still needed
Additional DAP cargoes have been added to the June line up over the past week bringing the new total to just over 1.2 million mt. Official DoF data show a further 1.45 million mt arriving through April/May (see separate update for further details). Together with the cargoes arriving through Q1, the total quantity imported for the Kharif season is now just short of 3 million mt.
Fertilizer Week estimates that about 1.5 million mt remains outstanding against the MoU agreements for the current fertilizer year (excluding the recent PhosAgro agreement which combines NPKs and DAP). Whereas
these agreements are not set in stone, we can assume that this quantity or thereabouts will be shipped over the forthcoming months to build up support for the Rabi season.
Rabi consumption over the past four years has averaged 4.7 million mt. Taking the 1.5 million mt MoU tonnage together with domestic production between July-March of an estimated 2.7 million mt (based on 300,000 mt/month average), total availability will be around 4.2 million mt.
Much depends on the level of Kharif consumption and the stocks that will remain by September. But given a healthy drawdown on inventory, this volume of 4.2 million mt would theoretically be insufficient to cover potential demand for the Rabi and leave some opening stock for the following year. It also assumes
a comparatively robust domestic output which in reality may not be sustained through the whole period, particularly if H2 phosacid prices remain on the higher side.
Therefore additional spot imports over and above the MoU tonnes could be needed of as much as 1 million mt (up to 2.5 million mt in total with MoU tonnes) through H2 but with the overall quantity dependent on how the monsoon eventually progresses. Ideally the bulk of these tonnes should be shipped July- September. Doubts over the monsoon at this time last year led to a delay in purchasing and a consequent surge in last minute imports during September/October, coinciding with the Chinese domestic market and consequently pushing prices up.
In 2014, a total of 1.23 million was imported into India in Q3, rising to 1.63 million mt in Q4, compared with 2.1 million and 747,000 mt in Q3 and Q4 2013 respectively.
Importers will prefer to avoid a late surge this year but will also want to delay the next tranche of spot buying to a) guage the behaviour of the monsoon and b) push prices down in the near term to provide some cushioning against the current rupee volatility.
The rupee has traded between 64.2 and 63.7 against the US dollar over the past few days as the currency markets speculate on US interest rates and the US Federal Reserve's next move.
Given a rate of INR 64 flat against the dollar and a maximum retail price of INR 24,000/mt, an import price of $480/mt CFR provides importers with a margin of barely 1% and does not include any provision for hedging or interest payments against delayed subsidies.
Importers therefore continue to push for numbers closer to $470/mt CFR which would provide a basic margin of 3%. Suppliers from China are resisting any move from current values, particularly in the light of the recent firming in freight rates.
Pakistan: Engro buys Saudi DAP in mid $480s/mt CFR
Engro has purchased a cargo of DAP from Ma'aden at a price in the mid $480s/mt CFR for end June/early July arrival. Pakarab is linked with a Chinese cargo in the high $480s/mt CFR and Fauji is also expected to finalise a cargo for June/July shipment by the end of the week. Against its recent enquiry, it received prices in the mid-high $480s/mt CFR, mostly of Chinese origin.
Engro will have had three DAP cargoes loading in May/June, two from Ma'aden and one Chinese cargo from Trammo. The reason for the decision to buy a third cargo was to lock in additional prompt tonnes for delivery by July 1 ahead of the proposed import tax increase. The threat of such an increase has since receded as reported last week in Fertilizer Week.
Suppliers have increased their price ideas into Pakistan for July with Chinese offers now in the high
$480s/mt CFR, having moved up from the low $480s/mt CFR for June. One of the arguments cited by suppliers of Chinese DAP is the higher freight, now being indicated at around $19/mt, up by $2-3/mt on previous rates.
Saudi tonnage has become as competitive as Chinese in some instances and as a result, out of the cargoes booked for 2015 arrival, over 55% has been souced from Saudi Arabia to date with 35% from China. This is a reversal of the trend seen last year which saw the market dominated by Chinese imports.
Including the Fauji cargo not yet confirmed, close to 440,000 mt DAP has been booked for shipment into Pakistan this year and represents close to half the import quantity required for the year.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Higher prices achieved in Pakistan
Firmer freights have been one of the main arguments cited by Chinese suppliers in price discussions in Pakistan for July cargoes. One sale has been reported this week in the upper $480s/mt CFR Karachi, up from the low $480s/mt CFR previously, which at current freights of around $19/mt would netback to the high $460s/mt FOB, still within the current price range published in Fertilizer Week.
Current prices for sales into South and Southeastern Asia, excluding India, are in the range of $467-470/mt FOB. For India the range is between the low-upper $460s depending on whether to EC or WC and size of vessel.
In India meanwhile the stalemate on price continues with buyers still pushing for a reduction of around $7- 10/mt in line with the rupee depreciation and suppliers maintaining a firm price nearer $480/mt CFR.
Of the 1.2 million mt in the line up to arrive into India in June, approximately 870,000 mt will have been shipped from China, a substantial quantity compared with previous years. It not only reflects the earlier start to the Indian DAP campaign due to lower opening stocks but also the increased flexibility afforded to Chinese suppliers following the removal of the export window.
One question frequently asked is how much DAP the Chinese producers can store at the ports. This is particularly relevant given the current situation in India at the moment with buyers holding off while they gauge the progression of the monsoon and at the same time put pressure on the price.
Prior to 2014 producers were bound by the rigid export windows and therefore tried to push as much into bonded warehouses as possible ahead of the closure of the export windows. The time taken to transport product along the Yangtse river, for example, and into the ports, was also much longer, requiring more planning by producers.
This year there is no need for the bonded warehouses and the speed and efficiency not only of the transport to the ports but the throughput at the ports has meant that for many producers it is merely a few days from leaving the plant to being available for export at the seaports.
A lower volume of other commodities has also freed up capacity at the ports for fertilizers. As such producers can be more flexible and act at relatively short notice on export orders. This is partly why inventory levels reported at the ports this year have been comparatively low. In terms of actual storage, it is estimated that as much as 1 million mt DAP could be stored if necessary.
Availability for 11-44-0 from mid July onwards has increased as traders back away from taking positions for the Brazilian market for H1 July onwards. As such prices have weakened to the $370-375/mt FOB range for this period.
YUC has confirmed the production of granular 11-52-0 and will load its first cargo at the end of June and will have around one cargo per month thereafter if demand is there.
FEDERATED STATE OF ASIA
Vietnam: Chinese cross-border tonnes dominate
Chinese cross-border DAP is priced at around $475-480/mt CFR in bags, a level too cheap for product coming through the seaports to compete with. As such interest in bringing any vessels into Vietnam through the official import channels remains extremely limited.
TSP
EUROPE
Bulgaria: Iran takes 75% of TSP exports
Q1 data, as reported by GTIS show Bulgarian TSP exports at 95,000 mt and amost exclusively shipped into Iran. This brings the total export volume to all destinations for the 12 months ending March 2015 to 250,000 mt of which 187,000 mt, or 75%, were shipped to Iran.

Sri Lanka: MoA issues new TSP tender
The Ministry of Agriculture issued a new tender for 28,000 mt TSP, plus urea and MOP, closing on June 29 for delivery in bags by the end of September.
Against the MoA's earlier tender that closed on June 9 for 18,000 mt TSP, an award is due to be confirmed within the next 2 days to Swiss Singapore for the full quantity. Swiss Singapore offered the lowest price in this tender at $339.33/mt CFR and $341.30/mt CFR with 180 and 270 days credit respectively.
PHOSPHORIC ACID
NORTH AMERICA
US: Phosacid exports got boost in May
US phosacid exports in May jumped 27.5% from one year earlier to 35,396 st (32,086 mt) P2O5, from 27,770 st (25,193 mt). However, the gain did not substantially change the trend over the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year that has closely mirrored the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.
The jump in May 2015 can be accounted for by the shipment of 8,079 st (P2O5) to Brazil, compared to no exports to that country one year earlier. The lion’s share of US phosacid exports in May were accounted for in the 16,886 st loaded for India.
For the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, US phosacid exports were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared with 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5 in the previous year.
The main customers for US phosacid in the current fertilizer year to the end of May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5. Canada has taken significantly less phosacid during the current fertilizer year through May compared with the prior year at 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Phosacid negotiations stall
Negotiations started this week in Dubai between OCP and its joint venture partners for Q3 contract shipments into India. Buyers are looking for a sizeable reduction in price against the current level of $805/mt P2O5 CFR while OCP is expected to be looking for a small increase or at least a rollover. These initial discussions did not however result in any agreement.
Bangladesh: BCIC issues tender for 50,000 mt phosacid
BCIC, on behalf of the DAP fertilizer Company (DAPFCL), issued a new tender for 50,000 mt solution phosphoric acid (52-54% P2O5) closing on July 29 for shipment in five lots of 10,000 mt solution to the CUFL jetty at Chittagong as follows: 1st , 2nd, 4th weeks of November, 1st and 2nd weeks of December.
PHOSPHATE ROCK
EUROPE
Poland: Update on Senegal rock project
In the 12 months ending March 2015, Grupa Azoty imported almost 230,000 mt rock from its mining concession in Senegal, almost double the volume imported in the previous 12-month period. It plans to reach 300,000 mt in the current calendar year.
The company is close to completing the feasibility study on the phosphate project. In a recent statement the chairman indicated that a decision on whether to proceed with extending the concession will be taken shortly, on completion of both the feasibility study and an environmental report. The existing mine is small with limited resources so to reach the group's aim of becoming self sufficient in rock, the development of a larger mine is necessary for which the cost has been estimated at PLN 500-600 million ($135-160 million). Police's annual rock requirement is currently around 1 million mt rock.
It is also working with the Senegalese government with a view to supplying fertilizers into Senegal and in February shipped 10,000 mt NPKs.
Bulgaria: Record rock imports
Agropolichim imported 152,400 mt phosphate rock in Q1 comprising 72,300 mt from Morocco, 55,000 mt from Syria and 25,000 mt from Jordan. While the volume from Syria was down on recent years, the quantity imported from Morocco increased.
Revamping work at Agroplochim's Devnya plant has led to increased demand for phosphate rock. In the 12 months ending March 2015, Bulgaria imported just over 600,000 mt phosphate rock, a record 12
month volume according to GTIS data.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: RCF tender for 40,000 mt phosphate rock
India's RCF issued a tender for 2 x 20,000 mt low grade phosphate rock (+/-10%), minimum 29% P2O5/63% BPL, closing on July 9 at 14:30hrs in New Delhi. Offers are to be valid for 30 days.
RCF requested the first 20,000 mt cargo be shipped to Mumbai in August with the second for October shipment.
Bangladesh: Moroccan rock lowest in BCIC tender
Against its tender of June 16 for 30,000 mt phosphate rock (72% BPL minimum), BCIC received four offers. The details are as follows:
NP/NPKS
EUROPE
Europe: NPK suppliers soon to set new prices
The European NPK market continues to see little activity but with demand building and significantly higher netbacks for producers sending NPKs to Asia, suppliers are expected to set higher prices in Europe shortly.
European NPK buyers are bidding around the $310-320/mt FOB level for Baltic Sea for 15-15-15, but suppliers see these prices as far too low and new prices are likely to be at least $335/mt FOB or the
equivalent when producers set their new season offers. For now, Baltic Sea 15-15-15 continues to be quoted in the range $320-335/mt FOB.
Belarus: NPK exports flat January-April
Belarus exported 211,000 mt NPKs between January and April, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.
Belarus sent 76,000 mt to Lithuania (with much of this volume re-exported), 60,000 mt to Poland and 36,000 mt to Ukraine, where import duty for Belarussian NPKs was suspended in August last year.
In the first quarter, Belarus exported 184,000 mt NPKs, a 10% increase year on year but in the month of April NPK exports fell 38% to 29,000 mt, with the majority of the exports going to Ukraine.
Belaruskali continues to expand its NPK production capability after launching its first NPK capacity in April, 2013. Last year the potash producer exported 181,700 mt NPKs, with 27,900 mt coming from its RU-1 facility and 153,800 mt from its RU-3 facility, which ramped up production capacity during 2014 to around 240,000 mt.
The company is planning to ramp up NPK production to as high as 720,000 mt/year in the coming years through the introduction of new NPK lines.
In 2014, Belarus exported almost 600,000 mt NPKs of which 34% went to Lithuania, 29% to Poland and 17% to Ukraine.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Nigeria: Industry suffers over lack of subsidy decision
Nigeria's fertilizer industry is currently paralysed by a lack of clarity over the future subsidy regime since President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29.
The current subsidy is 50% under the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) shared between the federal and state governments, according to the Fertilizer Producers & Suppliers Association of Nigeria (Fepsan).
"We have no idea of the rate and when it will happen," Fepsan Executive Secretary Ahmed Rabiu Kwa told Fertilizer Week. Suppliers are apprehensive and are holding off even though the farming season has begun, he said.
Nigeria currently imports 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 from a range of suppliers for use mostly on cereal crops. The industry body estimates potential NPK demand growth at 10% per annum and assesses the average NPK import price currently at $350/mt CFR.
OCP is currently discussing July shipments for Nigeria but nothing has yet been booked.
Fertilizer re-exports to neighbouring countries are prohibited by law.

ANALYSIS
Suppliers attempt to recover potash prices across the globe
Prices in the potash spot markets are largely unchanged this week as suppliers attempt to recover reductions across many markets so far in 2015. Suppliers had hoped that the $10/mt increase in contract prices in both China and India would help to increase waning prices, particularly in Brazil and the US, but so far this has not been the case.
Brazil is where most suppliers have set their sights in order to improve prices. The potash price in the country has fallen by as much as $40-50/mt in the first half of 2015 due mainly to low agricultural commodity prices, weak demand and credit issues amongst farmers.
New credit is set to reach farmers in early July and demand is building towards the autumn season, causing suppliers to plan price rises step by step through the coming months.
Brazilian imports improved in May but remain down 25% in the year so far, according to new ANDA data. Brazil imported
2.8million mt potash between January and May, a near 1 million mt fall on the previous year, but May potash imports increased 6.1% to 788,888 mt. Brazilian prices remain in the range of $330-$340/mt CFR with suppliers united at $340- $350/mt CFR range for July deliveries, before moving towards $355/mt CFR in August. Achieving some kind of increase during the third quarter is likely, but Brazil is unlikely to close 2015 at the $380/mt CFR level achieved last year.
Southeast Asian prices remain in the $300-345/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia with the low end seen in Malaysia, which remains a difficult market for potash sales. Similarly, some suppliers have increased prices to around $330/mt CFR for both Malaysia and Indonesia, but these levels are yet to be achieved. With currency depreciation, low palm oil prices and good stock levels in Malaysia particularly, achieving the price target will be a difficult task.
In the US, action has largely grinded to a halt with the market out of season. Some potash movement remains for crops other than corn but postings have further reduced to $345-365/st FOB with distributors looking for as low as $350/st FOB. At New Orleans, barges were last seen at $320-325/mt FOB and suppliers say this level supports recent fill offers for the US interior.
The European and Chinese domestic markets also remain out of season with little activity. Granular potash deals remain in the range of €300-310/mt CIF in northwest Europe but suppliers are said to be targeting price increases to around the €315/mt CIF level after discussions with buyers at this week's Prague Conference. In China port wholesale prices remain in the RMB 2,000-2,120/mt FCA range with activity unlikely to build up until nearer the autumn season.
ICL and K+S are expected to announce their contract deals to India shortly, which, if at similar levels to last year, should bring total firm volumes to around 4.2 million mt. Factoring in optional volumes, spot deals and any further tenders through the year, Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014's 4.2 million mt.
The $10/mt increase in China and India, along with increased demand to both countries, must now be seen as an achievement for suppliers. It remains to be seen whether significant price increases in Brazil, Southeast Asia and Europe can be achieved by the end of the year, but with price discipline less prevalent than in previous years, it is likely to be a difficult task.

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.
MARKETS
MOP
NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: Seasonal demand done, prices flat
There are few expectations for prompt demand, and suppliers note that values for granular potash already have fallen to a level that supports recent fill offers for the US interior markets. Prior barge trades were claimed at $320-325/st FOB New Orleans.
US Midwest: Only marginal demand remains
Some potash movement to retailers remains for crops other than corn, but even most of the soybean planting has been completed at this stage. Postings generally have moved to around $365/st FOB, but more and more distributors report retailers have no need to buy prompt tons unless they are offered in line with summer fill values around $350/st FOB.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Imports improve in May but remain down 25% -
ANDA
Brazil imported 2.8 million mt potash between January and May, a 25% fall (930,000 mt) year on year, according to the latest ANDA data.
The majority of the reduction in imports took place between February and April, while in May potash imports increased 6.1% to 788,888 mt.
Earlier this month, GTIS data showed that Brazil imported 2.3 million mt between January and May, a 30% fall.
During the period, Canpotex reduced volumes to Brazil by 29% to 646,000 mt, BPC cut volumes by 43% to 434,000 mt and Uralkali curbed volumes by 40% to 398,000 mt. K+S sent 388,000 mt, ICL sent 358,000 mt (with almost half coming from its Spanish and UK operations) and SQM sent 106,000 mt, according to GTIS.
Currency depreciation, weak agricultural prices and credit issues in Brazil have forced down farmer demand and caused a drop in spot prices amid strong competition in Brazil.
Brazil: Suppliers await demand build up
Prices in Brazil remain in the range of $330-$340/mt CFR with suppliers united at higher levels in the $340- $350/mt CFR range for July deliveries.
BPC confirmed that it has reached an agreement for a 60,000 mt delivery at $340/mt CFR in July. Currently there are limited deals as buyers react to the price increases and many made at the upper end of the range are believed to include some kind of rebate.
Uralkali is said to be sold out for June deliveries and has set a price of $345/mt CFR for July deals. BPC, ICL and Canpotex have priced June and July deliveries at $340-345/mt CFR while SQM is expected to offer at least $340/mt CFR for July deliveries and could raise its prices to as high as $350/mt CFR.
Buyers have indicated some level of acceptance for higher prices but with stocks said to be pretty high and with corn prices continuing to fall below cost-of-production levels, worries remain over whether significant price increases in the $15-25/mt CFR level by the end of August can be achieved.
Suppliers hope that farmers will increase buying once new lines of credit are given on July 1 and that worries of higher delays during autumn at the Brazilian ports may push for an influx of buying in July and August.
Latin America: Uralkali agrees three shipments above $340/mt CFR
Uralkali signed three shipments to Latin American countries outside of Brazil for June delivery at $340- 350/mt CFR levels.
A vessel carrying 20,000 mt granular potash is being delivered to Colombia and Guatemala, a shipment of 10,000 mt of granular potash is heading to Uruguay and a shipment of 15,000 mt of gMOP and 5,000 mt of sMOP is set for June delivery in Colombia and Ecuador.
EUROPE
Europe: Suppliers look for price push in Europe
Potash activity is seasonally slow in Europe and granular potash deals remain in the €300-310/mt CIF NW Europe range with very few deals reported.
Suppliers are said to have put forward to buyers possible European price increases during this week's Prague Conference. ICL are said to be selling higher than €310/mt CIF while Uralkali is now looking for €315/mt CIF for granular potash from July 1.
In recent weeks there has been growth regarding standard potash deals from larger buyers with news of possible tightness in the standard market, as Belaruskali produces high levels of granular product and large quantities of standard potash is sent to India and China on new contracts.
Generally standard potash is said to be traded in the €275-285/mt CIF range with deals for larger buyers quoted at the €275/mt CIF level.
Belarus: BPC expects flat or higher potash export revenues in 2015
BPC expects full year 2015 export revenue to be no worse than last year and possibly better, the company's Director General Elena Kudryavets told RIA Novosti on July 16.
The company increased its exports of potash by 66% in 2014 to 9.5 million mt compared to 2013 as BPC recovered from the break-up of its alliance with Russian producer Uralkali in 2013.
The announcement does not necessarily mean the company plans to export more in 2015 as higher levels of potash have been contracted to China and India by BPC at higher prices than last year. However, reduced spot prices in some markets such as Malaysia and Brazil may mean the company has to export more to achieve higher export revenues.
Kudryavets said that BPC is currently supplying more than 100 countries, with the majority going to India, China, Brazil, Southeast Asia and Europe. However, the company also began exporting to the US this year for the first time since 2008.
She added that BPC expects total volume of potash deliveries in 2015 to fall to 59-61 million mt this year.
BPC gets its potash from Belaruskali which produced a total of 10.3 million mt of potash in 2015. Belaruskali increased production in Q1 by 9% year on year to 2.6 million mt and has been producing at very high rates during Q2, pushing back planned maintenance at its RU#2 and RU#3 units until later in the year if at all in 2015.
With possible higher exports from BPC and higher potash production necessary for Belaruskali's increasing NPK operations, Belaruskali is likely to surpass the 10.3 million mt it produced in 2014 and may become the largest individual potash producer this year in the wake of the loss of Uralkali's SK-2 mine in November 2014.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Shipments build up on contract deals
More than 150,000 mt potash is scheduled to arrive in India in the next week as volumes from new contracts signed between major suppliers and buyers in India begin to filter into the market.
Potash arriving this week comprises seven shipments from Uralkali, APC and BPC. Uralkali sent three cargoes totalling 72,000 mt to Shriram, Zuari and IPL, APC sent two shipments totalling 30,600 mt to Zuari and BPC sent 54,000 mt to Chambal and IPL.
The new volumes bring total June shipments up to 264,070 mt, according to new port data.
Some volumes in the RCF tender for 145,000 mt firm and 120,000 mt optional potash, which closed on May 7 and was awarded to BPC, are also likely to soon arrive in the country.
In India, BPC recently agreed volumes in excess of the 700,000 mt sent in the previous fertilizer year, Canpotex closed deals for 1.3 million, APC signed 505,000 mt and Uralkali agreed deals for 800,000 mt. There are rumours that K+S signed around 150,000 mt to India, most likely with IPL, which means only ICL is yet to announce its quantities.
If ICL signs volumes around the 700,000 mt it sent last year then the total volumes sent to India should be around 4.2 million mt. Factoring in optional volumes, spot deals and any further tenders through the year, Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014's 4.2 million mt.
Sri Lanka: MoA announces potash tender
Sri Lanka's Ministry of Agriculture has announced a tender for 28,700 mt of standard potash, closing on 29 June.
In February, the MoA's last tender for 24,000 mt potash was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd. with Uralkali tonnage after they made an offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit. The product was delivered in May.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: Prices remain weak as suppliers hold offers
Southeast Asian prices remain in the $300-345/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia with the low end seen in Malaysia, which remains a difficult market for potash sales.
Last week, two tenders totalling 15-20,000 mt were sold at the very weak $300/mt CFR level in Malaysia, likely by local traders selling off stocks, and sources say that it's difficult to make any deals above $305/mt CFR currently. Some suppliers are holding prices around $330/mt CFR in Malaysia and hope that price discipline can push up the Malaysian potash price.
Malaysia has turned out to be a very difficult market for sellers so far in 2015. The ringgit has weakened 15% against the dollar in the last 12 months, palm oil prices remain at low levels, demand is weaker than some expectations and some sources highlight quite strong stocks. All these factors mean that competition is abundant in the country and prices have been weak so far in 2015. The Malaysian market is unlikely to build up now until August, ahead of the November season.
In Indonesia, the sMOP market is believed to be trading as low as $320/mt CFR but suppliers are now said to be offering no less than $330/mt CFR, with no deals yet confirmed at that level.
Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam are quoted in the $330-345/mt CFR range with very few deals at the upper end and only for very small volumes.
China: Potash activity remains slow with reduced imports
The Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow, with imports reduced so far in June.
Mainstream standard potash deals have generally been concluded in the RMB 2,020-2,100 ($325-338/mt) FCA range with some small volumes still trading at RMB 2,000/mt FCA. Small quantities of the 62% K2O white MOP are still said to have been purchased at RMB 2,120/mt FCA.
June imports have so far been slow, particularly for rail cross border imports which are estimated to be lower than 100,000 mt this month. May potash imports are believed to have been quite low, at roughly 550,000 mt, which would be a 41% fall on May 2014 imports and around 300,000 mt lower than in April.
Most sources in China expect that with the market off-season, some contracted imports are being postponed and the market should build up in the coming months ahead of the autumn season.
South Korea: Potash imports up 70% in May
South Korea imported 79,000 mt of potash in May, a 70% increase year on year and the highest May imports since 2011, according to GTIS.
During the month, 76% of the volumes or 60,000 mt came from Canpotex, while South Korea imported 13,000 mt from BPC and around 6,000 mt from Laos' producers.
Between January and May, South Korea imported 312,453 mt of potash, a 5.8% increase year on year and the highest potash imports for this period since 2005. During the five-month period, South Korea imported 71% or 222,000 mt from Canpotex, 68,000 mt from BPC and 21,210 mt from Laos (surpassing volumes from Laos for the whole of 2014).
SOP
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Two small SOP tenders announced
RCF has announced a tender for 2-3,000 mt SOP closing next week on June 22 while IFFCO has announced a tender for 2,000 mt closing at the end of this week, June 19.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: SDIC Luobupo produces strongly ahead of maintenance
Chinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo produced around 150,000 mt of SOP in May, according to sources, bringing its January to May production to 850,000 mt.
January-April volumes were up 7% year on year at 696,000 mt and product seems to be continuing in this vein.
The company is planning to close its operations for regular summer maintenance between the end of June and the end of August.
Some big buyers are believed to be purchasing SOP ahead of the maintenance dates, with prices seen around RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT and SDIC cargoes should be sold out shortly.
The price represents a RMB 350/mt fall compared to SDIC's February 27 pricelist but some distributors expect the SOP price will strengthen while SDIC is down for maintenance due to the planned decline in output.
NPKS
EUROPE
Europe: NPK suppliers soon to set new prices
The European NPK market continues to see little activity but with demand building and significantly higher netbacks for producers sending NPKs to Asia particularly, suppliers are expected to set higher prices in Europe shortly.
European NPK buyers are bidding around the $310-320/mt FOB level for Baltic Sea 15-15-15, but suppliers see these prices as far too low and new prices are likely to be at least $335/mt FOB when producers set their new season offers. For now, Baltic Sea 15-15-15 deals continue to be quoted in the range $320-335/mt FOB.
Belarus: NPK exports flat January-April
Belarus exported 211,000 mt NPKs between January and April, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.
Belarus sent 76,000 mt to Lithuania (with much of this volume re-exported), 60,000 mt to Poland and 36,000 mt to Ukraine, where import duty for Belarusian NPKs was suspended in August last year.
In the first quarter, Belarus exported 184,000 mt NPKs, a 10% increase year on year but in the month of April NPK exports fell 38% to 29,000 mt, with the majority of the exports going to Ukraine.
Belaruskali continues to expand its NPK production capability after launching its first NPK capacity in April, 2013. Last year the potash producer exported 181,700 mt NPKs, with 27,900 mt coming from its RU-1 facility and 153,800 mt from its RU-3 facility, which ramped up production capacity during 2014 to roughly 240,000 mt.
The company is planning to ramp up NPK production to as high as 720,000 mt/year in the coming years through the introduction of new NPK lines.
In 2014, Belarus exported almost 600,000 mt NPKs of which 34% went to Lithuania, 29% to Poland and 17% to Ukraine.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Nigeria: Industry suffers over lack of subsidy decision
Nigeria's fertilizer industry is currently paralysed by a lack for clarity over the future subsidy regime since President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29.
The current subsidy is 50% under the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) shared between the federal and state governments, according to the Fertilizer Producers & Suppliers Association of Nigeria (Fepsan).
"We have no idea of the rate and when it will happen," Fepsan Executive Secretary Ahmed Rabiu Kwa told Fertilizer Week. Suppliers are apprehensive and are holding off even though the farming season has begun, he said.
Nigeria currently imports 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 from a range of suppliers for use mostly on cereal crops. The industry body estimates potential NPK demand growth at 10% per annum and assesses the average NPK import price currently at $350/mt CFR.
OCP recently said it is planning on sending 60,000 mt of NPKs to Africa in June, mostly 15-15-15 for Nigeria, and indicated $330/mt FOB for sales into the African markets. OCP is currently discussing July shipments for Nigeria but nothing has yet been booked.
Fertilizer re-exports to neighbouring countries are prohibited by law.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
Allana shareholders approve ICL takeover
At a meeting of shareholders this week, Allana Potash Corp has agreed to approve the company's acquisition by Israeli potash producer ICL.
Allana Potash's flagship asset is in the Danakhil evaporite basin, part of the Dallol region of the Afar province of Ethiopia.
Under the agreement, most Allana shareholders will receive $0.50 in cash per Allana share while some will receive the equivalent of $0.50 in shares of ICL for each Allana share exchanged.
The takeover was approved by 96% of the votes cast by securityholders and 90% of the company's shareholders who were allowed to take part.
ICL, which currently holds a 16.36% share in Allana, offered a total of around CAD 137 million ($111 million) for Allana in March, arguing that the takeover would suit its strategy to broaden its sources of raw materials globally while reducing its production costs and focusing on high growth emerging markets.
Earlier this year, Allana announced a preliminary economic assessment for the site which showed an after- tax net present value of $1.6 billion based on annual production of one million mt of SOP over an estimated operating life of 77 years. Allana wanted to secure financing for necessary construction by mid-2015 to begin building a mine next year. MOP production was slated begin by 2018 with SOP production the following year.
ICL plans to accelerate pre-construction engineering work, secure project financing and reduce the company's risks associated with the project.
The takeover deal is expected to close on June 22, subject to certain conditions.

MagIndustries reveals evidence of alleged bribery
Potash junior MagIndustries has announced the resignation of its auditor and has commenced a delisting review as an internal investigation finds evidence of bribes totalling several thousand dollars were paid by its subsidiaries to Congolese officials.
In January, MagIndustries was prompted to carry out an internal investigation after Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched their offices. The RCMP have not laid yet any charges against MagIndustries
The Toronto-based company said in a news release that there is evidence to show that its wholly-owned subsidiary Eucalyptus Fibre de Congo made four payments totalling as much as $76,500 to inspectors and officials in Congo to reduce EFC's debts and taxes.
MagIndustries is still investigating a fifth alleged bribe, which took place in 2013.
However, due to a lack of funding from its largest shareholder, MagIndustries has had to dissolve the committee investigating the allegations, many of which involved the development of MagIndustries 90% owned Mengo potash mining project in the Republic of Congo. The Congolese government holds the other 10%.
MagIndustries said that its controlling shareholder, Evergreen Holding Group, has informed it that it cannot cover the millions of Canadian dollars involved as expenses to continue the investigation but will seek funds to do so.
In the meantime, four directors, including three on the special committee, have resigned from MagIndustries and its chief financial officer has been suspended. In addition, Richey Morrow has been appointed its co- chief executive officer along with current CEO Longbo Chen.
Ernst & Young has resigned as the auditor for the company effective June 16, concluding that in their professional judgment they cannot complete MagIndustries' consolidated financial statements for 2014 in accordance with professional standards.
"Any resumption of the investigation will depend on the appointment of new independent directors and on the controlling shareholder raising sufficient funds to fund such resumption," MagIndustries said.
The company also announced that it is reviewing the possibility of delisting from the Toronto Stock Exchange. If the company is unable to demonstrate on or before 17 July that it meets TSX's requirements for continued listing, it will be forced to delist.
MagIndustries had been in talks earlier this year with major Chinese potash producer Qinghai Salt Lake over a possible investment by QSL in the Mengo project but with the bribery investigation ongoing, any investment is unlikely at this point.
The company also confirmed in January that a Letter of Commitment from November 2013 made by the China Development Bank for the majority of funding for construction of the Mengo project remains active. The delay in approval of the loan is due to more conservative lending environment and tighter fiscal controls in China, MagIndustries remarked, but finalising the loan remains indefinitely delayed.
The site's potential deposit reserve is estimated at 33.2 million mt of potash, which the company intends to sell into markets in Asia, Europe and South America.

Sirius Minerals shares hit as planning report sees policy clash
North York Moors National Park Authority's planning committee for Sirius Minerals' York Potash development has highlighted certain problems with the application but have yet to make a decision on whether it should go ahead.
The company's shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 28% on 18 June.
The report says that while there is an economic case for the mine, "the application has a clear and
fundamental conflict with both local and national policies… The greater public interest is considered to be that of the statutory National Park purposes which protect the North York Moors."
Building such a large mine in a national park clashes with current policy guidelines, the report said, and Sirius' consultants have underestimated the environmental effects of some details of the plan.
However, the report also said that there is "very strong local support" for the mine, the economic impacts could be of "national significance" and that mitigation plans put in place by Sirius "go a long way towards moderating the impact" of the mine.
Sirius disagrees with certain policy interpretations reached by the committee and that the project is in the public interest due to "the substantial scale of the benefits and extent to which the environmental effects have been mitigated or compensated for," the company said.
"Responsibility for balancing the various issues related to this application rests with the members of the Authority and we believe the case for approval is very strong because the Project represents a once in a generation opportunity," Chief Executive Chris Fraser said.
The report did not include any recommendation, leaving this up to a special planning committee on June 30. If the special committee cannot come to a decision then the application could be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, which could delay the process for as long as nine months.
The decision had already been delayed until May from the start of this year and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council has already given the go ahead for the section of the MTS in its jurisdiction.
All of the other major approvals have been given apart from Sirius' application for harbour facilities, which is currently being examined by the planning inspectorate.
The company is planning a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.
Danakali set for Colluli Definitive Feasibility Study in Q3
Danakali Ltd, formerly South Boulder Mines, has submitted the last set of its social and environmental assessments for the Colluli potash project to the Eritrean Ministry of Mines and Energy.
The assessments will be used to develop both social and environmental management plans, which will be submitted after the site's definitive feasibility study is completed, currently estimated to be in Q3 2015.
In May, the company announced a 1.1 billion mt maiden ore reserve estimate at 10% K2O equivalent at Colluli. The estimate was based on a 287 million mt proved ore reserve and an 820 million mt probable ore reserve at the Eritrean site, with over 85% of its measured and indicated resource included in the estimate.
The company said the site is capable of producing SOP, SOP-M and MOP and the reserve could last more than 200 years based on modeled production rates in its recent pre-feasibility study (PFS).
In March, South Boulder announced a PFS for the Colluli project. The study showed that with open pit mining the project would have initial production output of 425,000 mt/year of SOP in 2018, increasing to 850,000 mt/year from year five.
Potash West commissions Ercosplan
Potash junior Potash West has brought on German consultants and engineers Ercosplan to oversee technical operations in its South Harz project in Thuringia, Central Germany.
The site requires further drilling to upgrade its resource to JORC standards and the consultants believe that a maximum of three drill holes are necessary to upgrade the project's resource.
Potash West and Ercosplan are now planning the new drill holes and are carrying our discussions with drilling contractors.
The Kullstedt part of the licence currently holds a large exploration target of 4 to 5 billion mt of potash ore at a grade of between 7 and 25% K2O.
East Exploration Pty Ltd, in which Potash West has a 55% stake, owns the South Harz project.
In May, Potash West said it may sell 100% of the South Harz project to Petratherm Ltd but parties decided not to proceed with the deal. Potash West and East Exploration are now looking at other opportunities to achieve a similar outcome.
PhosAgro launches new bulk terminal
Russian phosphate producer PhosAgro has now commissioned Smart Bulk Terminal, its new fertilizer terminal at Ust-Luga on the Gulf of Finland.
The opening ceremony for the new terminal, which has a capacity of over 1.5 million mt of mineral fertilizers/year and 80,000 mt of fertilizer storage space, took place on July 16.
The project is considered unique because handling and storage facilities can be doubled in a short time period and fertilizers are unloaded from railcars at the site onto specialised sea-shipping containers designed for quick loading and unloading.
At present the Smart Bulk Terminal can handle 180 mineral hopper barges/day and can load ships at a rate of 15,000 mt/day.
"Developing our own port terminal capacities enables us to decrease transportation costs and further strengthens PhosAgro's position as the leader on the global cost curve," PhosAgro Chief Executive Andrey Guryev said in a company statement.
Total investments in the project amounted to RUB 650 million ($12 million), with funds coming from PhosAgro and Ultramar, Russia's largest provider of container transportation services for fertilizers, in accordance with their 70/30 ownership of Smart Bulk Terminal.

ANALYSIS
Prices continue inching upwards
Global spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards March, with higher indications from the Middle East and China. Brazilian prices also demonstrated increases, albeit limited.
Tasweeq’s latest 35,000 mt tender, which closed on June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB, though this has yet to be confirmed.
Iran’s IGCC sold 30,000 mt of crushed lump product at $139/mt FOB, according to sources, and will close a tender for 30,000 mt of granular material June 22.
Prices in China increased for domestic sales at port and for international business, with one trade as high as $164.50/mt CFR. Port inventories remained low, while several phosphate and NPK producers reported good stock levels.
FACT’s recent 15-25,000 mt tender was awarded at $165/mt CFR, disproving some buyers’ prices ideas as low as $155/mt CFR.
Anglo American’s latest 37,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded at $160/mt CFR, though some had heard
$155/mt CFR. At either price, the award was above Anglo’s previous tender, and still within recent weeks’
assessed levels of $150-160/mt CFR.
The higher levels are in line with Fertilizer Week forecasts for slight increases in June and July following dramatic drops in previous weeks, as buyers held off purchasing as they awaited the bottom of the market. Market participants now report tight spot availability from Middle Eastern sellers, meaning those needing to obtain stock are having to bid slightly higher.
However, concerns persist over downstream phosphate demand, and it is not believed that fundamentals can support considerable price increases in sulphur.
Meanwhile, OCP remains out of the spot market, and is reportedly covered for requirements to late August.
Prices in some Mediterranean regions were pegged slightly higher, while elsewhere they were stable.
Negotiations for Q3 contracts across the globe are expected to have begun by next week. North African negotiations are yet to commence, with limited expectations expressed, though both sides are likely to push for price movements in the direction suited to them.
Brazilian buyers have indicated that they will resist any Q3 increases, and one buyer suggested they may increase their proportion of spot purchases talks result in an increase. European talks also had yet to formally commence, though no great change is expected in either direction.
Highlights of the week:
∙Tasweeq awards tender in mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB
∙Chinese business heard up to mid-$160s/mt CFR
∙Iran's IGCC sells crushed lump in high $130s/mt FOB
∙FACT tender awarded at $165/mt CFR
∙Latest Anglo tender heard at $155-160/mt CFR
∙OCP requirements met to late August
∙Q3 talks in various regions to commence over coming week
MARKETS
SULPHUR
NORTH AMERICA
Canada: Vancouver FOB sulphur slightly higher
Prices for spot exports of sulphur from Canada were assessed slightly higher, with the range extending to $130-140/mt FOB Vancouver from $130-135/mt FOB.
However, no firm deals were confirmed at the higher levels, but market participants suggested that business had already been concluded in the high $130s/mt FOB, and price increases elsewhere suggest that levels up to $140/mt FOB should be achievable.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Buyers plan to resist any Q3 increases
Brazilian buyers plan to resist increases on Q3 sulphur contracts, arguing that demand is unchanged while availability should be increasing in Q3.
Buyers expect nothing above Q2 levels of around $130-135/mt FOB US and $140/mt FOB Middle East
One buyer suggested they may do an increased proportion of purchasing on a spot basis if contract negotiations prove too difficult.
Meanwhile, Anglo American’s latest 37,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded this week at around $160/mt CFR, though other sources pegged the number as low as $155/mt CFR.
This suggests Brazilian spot levels remain in the $155-160/mt CFR range, where they have been assessed for several weeks. However, prices at the lower end of this range are unlikely to be achievable in the current market.
Anglo American was set to receive 38,850 mt from Ust Luga via Trammo on the Kouyou at the Termag Terminal of Rio Grande June 18, having previously received 36,489 mt from Corpu Christy via Koch May 26.
Vale was set to receive several cargoes. Trammo was sending 33,500 mt from Ust Luga on the Vipava with and ETA of June 23, having sent 33,651 mt on the Mandarin Dalian for arrival June 12.
Oxbow was sending 31,500 mt on the Pacific Calm from Louisiana for arrival June 30, having previously sent 38,662 mt from Beaumont on the Orange River for arrival May 23.
Shell was sending 38,500 mt on the Ocean Eternity from Beaumont for arrival July 10, while KPC was sending 31,500 mt on the RM Dynasty from Shuaiba to arrive July 17.
All of the above arrivals are for Tiplam at Rio Grande.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Q3 talks yet to commence
Suppliers of Russian sulphur have not yet begun discussions for Q3 contracts with their consumers.
Talks are expected to commence later this week or early next week.
Meanwhile, suppliers say that their current loadings of product are going well.
EUROPE
Mediterranean: Sulphur prices reported stable to higher
Mediterranean sulphur prices remain mostly stable, although there were further signs of increases in some regions.
One trader reported business in Egypt around $140/mt CFR, but with payment terms of six months.
The same trader reported strong competition in Turkey from Greek and Romanian supply.
Another trader reportedly obtained Libyan material in the low $130s/mt FOB and was expected to seek the mid-$140s/mt CFR in the Med region, but market players were not sure whether this would be achievable.
However, crushed lump product was reported sold in the high $130s/mt CFR Mediterranean.
Europe: Views differ on expected Q3 settlements
Opinions differed on the likely outcome for European Q3 sulphur contracts, although market players overall do not expect any great change.
Negotiations are expected to begin later this week.
Sellers hope to recover some Q2 decreases, arguing that the euro/dollar exchange rate is not as unfavourable for buyers as it as when Q2 levels were agreed. Relatively positive current global sentiment in sulphur markets will likely help them.
But some buyers argue that further decreases are necessary, and point to good availability of product.
Settlements for Q2 ranged from a rollover to a decrease of $5/mt or less, but the assessed settlement range for barge/railcar contracts remained $158-170/mt CFR, as no settlements were reported outside of this range. However, it is likely that very few contracts were settled at the upper end of this range. The main reason for the reductions was weakness in the euro relative to the dollar, which had left European buyers paying more for their contracts in euro terms.
Market participants are hopeful that talks will not drag on as long as Q2 discussions did.
Elsewhere, Neste’s refinery in Porvoo, Finland, this week restarted production following a scheduled maintenance that began in April. It was the largest turnaround in the refinery's history.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Iran: IGCC sells crushed at $139/mt FOB
Iran’s IGCC awarded a 30,000 mt tender of crushed lump sulphur to a Chinese trader at $139/mt FOB, according to market sources.
The seller will reportedly close a 30,000 mt tender for granular product on June 22.
Qatar: Latest Tasweeq tender mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB
Tasweeq’s latest 35,000 mt tender, which closed June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB, though no firm conclusion was confirmed.
Traders contacted by Fertilizer Week said they bid below $146/mt FOB but were not successful.
Some suggested prices may be even higher.
The seller's last tender closed on May 19 and was awarded in the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB.
Tasweeq's posted selling price for June volumes is $141/mt FOB, while recent spot sales from the Middle East have been reported in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB.
Morocco: Q3 talks in early stages; OCP out of spot
Negotiations for Q3 Moroccan sulphur contracts are still in their early stages, and parties are reluctant to disclose expected settlements at this point.
Meanwhile, OCP remains out of the spot market, as the buyer is reportedly fully covered till the end of August.
Elsewhere, a vessel was sought to move 20,000 mt of granular sulphur from the Black Sea port of Poti to either Jorf Lasfar or Safi.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: FACT tender awarded at $165/mt CFR
FACT’s June 10 tender for 15-25,000 mt sulphur for delivery to Cochin July 6-10 was awarded to Swiss Singapore at $165/mt CFR, disproving some buyer price ideas of $155-160/mt CFR.
Recent business to CIL was also reported in the mid-$160s/mt CFR.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Prices continue gradual uptick
Chinese prices climbed further this week, although market action was fairly limited on a lack of speculative activity. Most buying was for downstream users.
Spot price at ports rose to RMB 1,240-1,260/mt FCA, up RMB 20/mt on the week.
Port inventories dropped to around 900,000 mt but rebounded to 930,000 mt by June 18.
International offers were in the $160s/mt CFR, being driven up by reported relatively tight availability of MIddle Eastern product.
Some reported bids from Chinese buyers in the low-mid-$160s/mt CFR and one trader said they had concluded a sale of 35,000 mt ex-Middle East at $164.50/mt CFR this week.
Crushed lump in some cases was close to $150/mt CFR, but some reported crushed lump prices still as low as $138/mt CFR.
Among domestic producers, Sinopec’s Puguang was quoting RMB 1,200/mt FCA at Wenzhou port and RMB 1,190/mt EXW. Its inventory levels are 15,000 mt at port and 20,000 mt at plant, indicating little pressure on pricing.
Some large phosphate & NPK producers in Hubei said they built stock when offers were in the low $150s/mt CFR and some paid in the low $130s/mt CFR for lump product. Therefore, although port inventories declined, the stock levels in plants increased in some cases.
Elsewhere, there was a gathering of sulphur traders in Nanjing on June 18, hosted by Bohai Commodity Exchange. The exchange, based in Tianjin in Northern China, has provided an electronic platform for spot trading of sulphur from July 2013. It is now encouraging major sulphur importers and large phosphate producers to transact on the platform.

ANALYSIS
Price stability continues as deal outcomes awaited
Sulphuric acid markets remained balanced and stable, with European sellers and traders awaiting the outcome of Brazilian deals while Asian sellers and traders continued to receive spot demand from India.
Petrobras is seeking offers for 60,000 mt towards its acid requirements this year as a possible alternative to its recent frequent purchases of 15,000 mt parcels. The buyer continues to wait for the startup of a refinery that was expected to help meet its acid requirements. In addition, Mosaic closed its latest 12,000 mt tender.
It is yet to be revealed whether European FOB and Brazilian CFR prices have changed at all from their stable levels of recent months, and these deals should provide further indications.
Morocco remains relatively inactive on sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced to as low as 30,000 mt/month and these requirements can be met by current long-term contracts.
In Asia, Indian spot prices continue to be pegged in the high $60s/mt CFR as demand from the country persists. Reports of a purchase by PPL in the low $50s/mt CFR were attributed to a swap whereby the buyer will have to resell the product at the same price, suggesting that the price is not representative of true spot levels.
Chinese import prices were also reportedly firm at $30-40/mt CFR, roughly in line with domestic prices.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s May exports of sulphuric acid doubled year on year to 296,090 mt, though the total for the first five months was still down 2.5% at 1.18 million mt. Record monthly volumes went to Thailand and Vietnam.
∙Petrobras seeks offers for 60,000 mt
∙Mosaic closes latest 12,000 mt tender
∙OCP reports lower spot requirement for coming months
∙Indian demand still firm in $60s/mt CFR
∙PPL reportedly gets tonnes on deal swap
∙South Korea's May exports double on record SE Asian volumes
Base Metals
Base metals fell further over the course of the week, as concerns over a potential Greek default on sovereign debt and a possible eurozone exit weighed heavily on prices. Some metals were seen as oversold, and a weakening dollar also offered hopes for some stability. LME copper was down to $5,748/mt for cash.
DAP & Sulphur
In theory summer spot phosphate cargoes should be lining up for the US Gulf, but there are no substantial volumes committed outside of a part cargo expected from EuroChem this month. This leaves Mosaic with little else to do but to run its plants and fill its consignment warehouses in the US interior, keeping all of its sulphuric acid in house. Meanwhile, the working assumption is that PotashCorp's closure of its sulphuric acid unit at Geismar, Louisiana, was accounted for by the market in prior months, but those expectations will be tested in coming weeks and months.
Global spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards March, with higher indications particularly from the Middle East and China. Tasweeq's latest 35,000 mt tender was heard awarded in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB, and Chinese deals were reported as high as $165/mt CFR.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices remain stable for the fifth consecutive week at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China, as sulphur and ammonia prices were largely unchanged and expectations of oversupply have been tempered slightly in recent months.
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Petrobras seeking 60,000 mt
Petrobras is seeking 60,000 mt of sulphuric acid towards its annual requirements, with bids due by June 23, sources said.
Petrobras needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.
Meanwhile, Mosaic closed its latest 12,000 mt tender June 18, though no prices were yet disclosed. The tonnes are for August delivery.
EUROPE
Europe: Spot stable and contracts yet to finalise
Spot prices for sulphuric acid exports from Europe remained stable at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with a lack of new reported business.
Upcoming Brazilian sales will give a clearer indication of any possible movement from price levels that have been stable for several months.
Moroccan spot demand is lacking, and although overall volumes to the US are strong, spot business has been limited.
Meanwhile, further indications of Q3 European contracts have yet to be revealed, although no great change is expected from Q2 levels.
Sweden: Q1 exports up 6.1% despite March drop
Sweden exported 120,006 mt of sulphuric acid in Q1 2015, up 6.1% year on year despite a 54.5% drop in March volumes.
Norway, Finland, the US and Morocco remained the four largest destinations for Q1, though their relative shares altered slightly.
Cuba took 10,500 mt after not receiving any volumes from Sweden in Q1 2014.
Spain: Q1 exports climb 31%
Spain’s sulphuric acid exports for Q1 were up 30.8% at 265,621 mt.
Chile has been the key destination for tonnes, taking 59,020 mt compared with 38,206 mt in Q1 2014.
The volumes going to Morocco increased to 49,955 mt from 12,602 mt, while tonnes to Cuba increased to 40,375 mt from 10,474 mt.
The US was the destination for 19,003 mt, up from nothing in Q1 2014.
Brazil, on the other hand, received only 15,019 mt of Spain’s Q1 exports, down from 60,967 mt.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP requirements currently met by contracts
Morocco remains relatively inactive on sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced considerably and are currently met by term contracts.
The buyer reports that its requirement has declined to around 30,000 mt/month, well below the levels that it has imported over the past year, which averaged around 80,000 mt/month. It is suggested that these requirements can be met by current long term contracts.
CRU expects Morocco’s imports for 2015 to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.
Morocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Demand still firm; PPL gets product in swap
Indian demand remained firm, with prices pegged mostly in the $65-70/mt CFR range.
PPL reportedly obtained a cargo from Japan, with prices reported in the $50s/mt CFR, surprising many market participants. However, one source suggested the deal was a swap whereby the consumer will have to resell the same volume to the seller at the same price at a later date.
Good demand from the SSP sector in India is supportive of prices, especially on the west coast.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Japan/South Korea: Spot prices steady
East Asian spot prices for export remain stable at an assessment of $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, with most recent business falling within this range.
Indian demand remains a key supporter of spot prices, with some smaller spot enquiries from Vietnam.
A lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi's Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko's Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc's Onahama smelter.
The PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc's Onsan smelter shut on May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days.
Much uncertainty centres on how much PASAR is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts. The plant has not yet resumed output.
Later in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters.
China: Import prices pegged $30-40/mt CFR
Sources continued to peg spot prices for Chinese sulphuric acid imports in the $30-40/mt CFR range.
Acid prices in southern China were reported at RMB 360/mt for industrial use, but Jinchuan Copper’s Fancheng smelter was selling at RMB 240/mt, roughly equivalent to the $40/mt CFR import price in the region, sources said.
Netbacks for exports to India from southern China were pegged below $30/mt FOB, making them unattractive for domestic producers.
South Korea: May exports double; records to SE Asia
South Korea’s May exports of sulphuric acid doubled year on year to 296,090 mt, though the total for the first five months was still down 2.5% at 1.18 million mt.
Of the May tonnes 70,339 mt went to China, meaning it remained the largest destination for South Korean exports, though this was the smallest monthly volume South Korea has sent there since December.
India took 67,736 mt, Thailand took 46,748 mt and Chile took 46,646 mt.
The Thailand volume is the largest monthly volume from South Korea to that country on record dating back to at least 1997.
Vietnam took 19,038 mt, and this was the largest volume on record to that country too.
A cargo of 25,300 mt went to Mexico, and this is believed to be from the previously reported LS Nikko combi vessel tender.
