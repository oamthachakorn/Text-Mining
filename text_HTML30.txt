MARKET SUMMARY
Middle East February prices $26/t apart as buyer price ideas continue to slip
Reductions in Middle East monthly prices were widely antici- pated, yet the decrease of $17/t for the Ofﬁcial Selling Price (OSP) by UAE's Adnoc and the $30/t cut by Tasweeq in its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) shocked the market for different reasons. While both producers acknowledged the decline in demand resulted from a slowing phosphates market, some considered the OSP too high, though it is thought to reﬂect Adnoc's comfortable position. Tasweeq's decision bafﬂed some as it is over $10/t lower than the most recent spot sale in the Middle East for 2H February loading, concluded at around $100/t fob.
The price gap between the three monthly lifting prices is now wide at $26/t - a clear reﬂection of a weakening mar- ket. (See page 6 for comparisons of the three Middle East monthly prices since mid-2013.)
There is a lack of demand for sulphur, which has led to prices falling day by day in some regions. In the Mediter- ranean, one trader said "you have a price one day, it's gone the next."
The Chinese New Year holiday beginning later this week marks the start of two weeks of negligible demand in the

11.9mn t import market. The latest granular deals took place between the $90s/t and low-$100s/t cfr China as traders be- gin to liquidate, with spot crushed lump business concluded in the mid-$80s/t cfr. Molten sulphur trades have also moved down to the $80s/t cfr.
The key problem is the significant fall in phosphates demand and prices. Following the Chinese, Mosaic in the US has an- nounced it will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. Assuming these cuts are fully realised, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic's quarterly finished phosphate production capacity. The market now wonders who will follow Mosaic's lead? The US is not the global phosphates superpower it once was, its mantle taken by Morocco and China. Therefore, this announcement in itself will not be enough to balance the phosphates market, and further cutbacks - subsequently reduction in sulphur demand - should be expected.
Phosphates giant OCP's sulphur procurement situation in 1Q is another sign that supply of sulphur is outstripping demand in North Africa. GazpromExport (GPE) has decided not to sell to OCP this quarter against contracts, mainly down to a disagreement in prices. But this is not going to put pres- sure on OCP as the buyer has been snapping up spot cargoes of crushed lumps and granular in the range of $95-105/t cfr with little difficulty. GPE does not seem to be stressed either with nothing heading to Morocco this quarter, because demand in domestic markets are said to be picking up and it plans to re-allocate the quantities elsewhere.
Dry bulk freight rates still depressed
At the start of this week, there was a brief period of increasing upwards pressure on dry bulk freight rates as bun- ker fuel prices ticked up, catching up with the rise in crude oil prices in the latter part of last week. This increase, however, was short-lived as crude prices began to sink on 2 February, bringing bunker prices with them, and with the Baltic Dry Index hitting yet another historical low on 1 Feb- ruary, freight rates have continued to be depressed.
In an attempt to combat the problem of lower freight rates, ship owners, who are already operating on rates that are below opex, have begun the scrapping of ships and there has been a notable increase in layups. Layups in particular could change the face of the shipping industry but companies will face losing money in the meantime.
There is some hope that grain shipments will help increase freight rates, as more dry bulk vessel capacity is chartered
because of poor monsoon seasons in India and drought in South Africa calling for greater grain procurement levels. But this may not be enough to have any impact in the long run.

Phosphate market summary
Mosaic leads charge to rebalance market
The market is to some extent still reeling from the signifi- cant price falls seen last week which wiped 10pc off the cfr values in Latin America. Latin American prices have continued to fall (although by much less this week) as traders sell remaining lots from January vessels. India is full of product and southeast Asian demand is lacklustre.
With DAP/MAP prices plummeting in Latin America, it came as little surprise that a supply side response would ensue. Mosaic has taken the lead by announcing it will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotat- ing plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. Assuming these cuts are fully realised, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic's quarterly finished phosphate production capac- ity. The likely response will be a reaction in the domestic price, but Mosaic faces a delicate balancing act. On the one hand it wants to shore up the price for phosphates, but on the other it wants to protect domestic market share. Cutting production runs the risk of encouraging more DAP/MAP imports from Russia and Morocco. Mosaic will thus doubtless be hoping other producers follow suit. But the question is who will follow Mosaic's lead? The US is not the global phosphates superpower it once was, its mantle taken by Morocco and China, so this announce- ment in itself will not be enough to balance the market.
Fundamentally there is no demand of note anywhere in the world. This situation will continue for at least three weeks, and possibly longer until more Latin American demand emerges, the US domestic season gets underway and we have a better idea of how the Chinese domestic market is shaping up. In the meantime, producers will hope that the supply side curtailments do the trick.

Asia
China
Granular sales concluded between the $90s/t and low- $100s/t cfr
Prices are under pressure and traders are beginning to ac- cept the lower price ideas from buyers.
Earlier in the week, a full-sized granular sulphur cargoe was reportedly concluded at around $103/t cfr for February. Closer to the end of the week, a granular cargo is reported to have been finalised in the $90s/t cfr from a trader.
A cargo of crushed lump sulphur has been sold in the mid- $80s/t cfr.
Molten sulphur prices are also under pressure. Following last week's sales in the mid-$90s/t, two molten vessels for March arrival have been concluded in the $80s/t cfr, although details were sketchy.
There is market chatter that several uncommitted floaters are heading towards China, but trade there is expected to be muted in 1H February because of the national holiday.
Sellers will have to look for alternative markets to absorb supply during the vacuum period in China. When Chinese buyers return from their holiday, they are likely to face similar, if not lower, price offers from Puguang as stocks will be growing between now and then, and high port invento- ries (now at 1.3mn t, up 23pc on last week with significant growth in Nantong and Fangcheng).
Chinese domestic market weakens
Sinopec's Puguang lowered its domestic sulphur offers this week. Prices dropped to Yn880/t ex-Wanzhou, and fell to

Yn870/t ex-Dazhou.
Domestic trades at Nantong have taken place in the range Yn860-870/t ex-warehouse, a decrease on last week's range of Yn870-910/t ex-warehouse. Around 15,000t have been sold early this week at Yn870/t ex-warehouse in Nantong, equiva- lent to the mid-$100s/t cfr with Yn1/$0.15.
India
Buyer price ideas moving down
Price ideas from Indian sulphur importers lie in a wide range. Some have been bidding in the mid-$110s/t cfr for a few thousand tonnes of sulphur, and for larger sized cargoes price ideas are near $100/t cfr.
Containers were offered at $110-115/t cfr ex-Turkmenistan and ex-Iran earlier in the week, down on $115-117/t cfr indi- cated last week.
The last concluded spot sale was from Swiss Singapore to CIL - 25,000t ex-Middle East finalised a few weeks back in the high-$120s/t cfr. The MV Orion Express will start loading 45,000t in Ruwais on 5 February to deliver 25,000t to CIL and the balance to Paradeep against contract.
The following cargoes have been arranged to discharge in Paradeep:
The MV Navios Hios arrived on 31 January carrying 32,000t for IFFCO, and 8,000t for PPL, both loaded by Swiss Singapore in Jubail.
BGN is to ship 30,000t to PPL in at the end of February.
Swiss Singapore is to ship 30,000t to IFFCO at the end of February.
Swiss Singapore is to ship 30,000t to PPL in early March.
The sugar refining season is expected to come to an end later this month/early March. Following that, demand for sulphur will be dependant on the upcoming phosphate fertil- izer season.
Indian 1Q DAP imports limited...
The Indian Department of Fertilizers (DoF) has stopped the movement of imported DAP, NPK and MOP during February- March 2016. No formal notification has been issued, howev- er. The consequence is that DAP and MOP lying at the ports or warehouses in the country cannot be sold and transported into the interior.
Licensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP
It is further reported that the DoF will monitor the move- ment of domestic production. This will effectively reduce import demand for DAP, NPK and MOP to nil until end March.
DAP stocks are estimated at around 60,000t in various ports. Unsold stock of imported DAP, MOP and NPK lying at ports and warehouses will be subject to the new (likely reduced) subsidy which will be announced in early 2Q for the 2016-17 fertilizer year.
...Impact on sulphur to be monitored
Disregarding the decision by the DoF, DAP production rates in India have always been expected to be subdued in 1Q16 because of high DAP stocks and slow demand during the off season.
Something the market will be watching closely is what will happen to OCP's phosphoric acid deliveries to India in 2Q. The options are either for OCP to push through the quanti- ties to India, or to hold and delay negotiations.
Reliance tender awarded in mid/high-$90s/t fob
New Caledonia
With an annual sulphur requirement of 300,000-400,000 t/ yr (and two cargoes required for 1Q for delivery at Proni), Vale New Caledonia completed its most recent purchase last week. The cargo will load in Vancouver, with the price heard at $100/t fob, freight estimated at $10-12/t.
Indonesia
Vale's Indonesia operation, with sulphur requirement of 60,000 t/yr, already committed to a cargo that loaded in January.
Japan
Full year exports down 2pc in 2015
In 2015, Japan exported just under 1.2mn t of sulphur, down slightly by 2pc on the previous year.
China continued to be the biggest export market discharg- ing 996,000t of Japanese sulphur, down 2pc on 2014. A few Japanese cargoes were sent to India last year, totalling 75,000t, an increase of 109pc on 2014 volumes.
The Reliance e-auction is understood to have been sold in the mid/high-$90s/t fob to a Chinese trader. The cargo is for 25,000t, loading in Bedi on 14-18 February.
SNAPSHOT - SPOT GRANULAR PRICES/NETBACKS
Exports to Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines increased between 73pc and 263pc in 2015, compared to the prior- year.
In December 2015, Japan exported just under 85,000t of

Middle East
Argus FMB assessed the Middle East spot prices at $99-101/t fob this week, with one 2H February loader recently con- cluded at around $100/t fob. A firm bid for late-February/ early-March loading was at near $90/t fob but it was unclear if that was accepted by the seller.
Contract settlements in 1Q
There are contrasting reports for 1Q contract prices be- tween Middle East producers and North African buyers. The buy side has indicated agreements between the $110s/t and the low-$120s/t cfr; the sell side indicating the mid/ high-$120s/t cfr. With freight estimated at $12-15/t, the low- $120s/t cfr nets back to between mid/high-$100s/t fob.
With traders, Middle East producers have signed agreements over a month ago in the mid/high-$110s/t fob, with most traders indicating $115/t fob.
Argus FMB assessed the Middle East 1Q prices at $105-115/t fob.
Middle East February selling prices differ by $26/t
As market prices deteriorate, the range of Middle East monthly prices for February stretches to $26/t. The gap in prices is the widest since April 2014, when the difference was around $27/t.
Saudi Arabia
The Yasref tender is believed to have been awarded to an end-user at an undisclosed price. Sinopec offered 35,000t for 24-26 February loading in Yanbu.
In Jubail:
A vessel loaded 32,000t and sailed on 30 January for
China.
Another vessel 31,500t and sailed 2 February, reportedly for South Africa.
In Yanbu, Midgulf loaded 15,000t on the MV Great Arsenal, sailed 27 January for Turkey.
Qatar
The Tasweeq tender for 2H February loading is now con- firmed to have been awarded to BGN.
Licensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP
The decision by Tasweeq to put its February QSP down to
$89/t fob is driven by the rapidly deteriorating market situa- tion, particularly in China where the latest granular sulphur business is between the $90s/t and the low-$100s/t cfr.
Reaction towards the QSP is mixed. Buyers and those who are short welcomed the decision, calling it realistic. Others are concerned that this dampened market sentiment further and did not help the market to find a floor price.
In Ras Laffan:
A vessel loaded 38,500t and sailed on 20 January for
China.
MetalCorp loaded 35,000t on the MV Rana, sailed 28 January for Australia.
In Mesaieed, a vessel loaded 40,000t, sailing 4 February. The cargo previously loaded 25,000t in Ras Laffan and sailed for Mesaieed on 30 January.

North Africa
There are contrasting reports for 1Q contract prices be- tween Middle East producers and North African buyers. The buy side has indicated agreements between the $110s/t and the low-$120s/t cfr; the sell side suggested the mid/high- $120s/t cfr.
With FSU producers, prices for 1Q have been indicated by the buy and sell sides in the mid/high-$110s/t cfr for granu- lar. With a $10/t differentiate, crushed lumps are estimated in the mid/high-$100s/t cfr.
Morocco
With Mosaic announcing its cutback in phosphate produc- tion by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016, the spotlight is now on OCP and its phosphate production rate in 1Q.

DAP during February-March 2016. It is further reported that the DoF will monitor the movement of domestic production, which will effectively reduce import demand for DAP to nil until end-March. Domestic DAP production during 1Q has been expected to be insignificant. All these beg the question of what OCP will decide to do with its phosphoric acid ship- ments to India in 2Q, which will have a knock on effect on OCP's output and raw material consumption.
Spot prices in Morocco have been indicated between the mid-$90s/t and the mid-$100s/t cfr.
A cargo of 30,000t of sulphur will be going to OCP ex-Ust Luga, including Russian and Kazakh tonnes. This is thought to be against contract from Trammo.
Tunisia
Adnatco is in the freight market for 35,000t to load in Ru- wais, UAE, 11-15 February for shipment to Gabes or Sfax in Tunisia.
Egypt
The latest bids from buyers are in the $90s/t cfr, according to several traders.
Difficulties in importing to Egypt
The import of goods and commodities into Egypt has be- come increasingly difficult since the start of 2016. Conditions have been placed on imports - including the establishment of a register in the General Organisation for Export and Import Control - which will monitor the safety conditions
of factories exporting to the country. This is in addition to tightened measures imposed by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), because of the shortage of foreign currency, par- ticularly US dollars, in Egypt. Since the Arab Spring in 2011, tourists and foreign investments have dwindled, and foreign cash reserves dropped to around $16.4bn at the end of last year from $36bn prior to the uprising. The CBE now requires importers to provide 100pc cash deposits to banks on their letters of credit, up from 50pc previously. With this the bank is aiming to reduce import levels by $20bn in 2016, down from $80bn in 2015, therefore bolstering foreign currency reserves and encouraging domestic production and trade.
There has, however, been some respite for traders and importers as the CBE increased its maximum deposit limit in foreign currencies to $250,000/month on 3 February from $50,000/month.

Tupras lowers February price
Tupras has lowered its February price from TL 319/t fob to TL 265/t fob. At TL 1/$0.34, the February price is equivalent to around $90/t fob. This is equivalent to the $100s/t cfr Turkey for local buyers.
On 3 February a fire broke out at the Izmit refinery in the Kocaeli Gulf region of Turkey. The fire was extinguished by 11pm the same evening and Tupras said other refinery opera- tions were continuing as planned. Interruption of sulphur production is believed to be minor. The fire started because of a flaring equipment failure. The Izmit refinery has re- cently increased its sulphur production to 220,000 t/yr, over half of which is for the domestic market.
Toros looking for March delivery
Toros was looking for around 15,000t for March delivery, tar- geting in the $100s/t cfr, but scrapped the tender. Another enquiry is expected to be floated soon.
Bulgaria
Following last week's report, the latest Burgas tender for 6,000t of granular sulphur was awarded at below $100/t fob, instead of $100/t cfr. This compared with the previous ten- der sale at around $110/t fob. The vessel loaded this week for shipment to Toros in Turkey.

Gunvor Group acquires Europoort refinery
Geneva-based trading firm Gunvor Group completed the acquisition of the Europoort refinery, Rotterdam, from Ku- wait Petroleum International on 1 February. The 88,000 b/d refinery was put up for sale in 2014 following KPC’s decision not to go ahead with an upgrade programme at the facil- ity. The refinery will now be known as Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam and become part of Gunvor’s existing European refining network which includes plants in Antwerp, Belgium and Ingolstadt, Germany.
Sulphur production capacity there is estimated at 172 t/d - around 22,000t were produced in 2014. It remains to be seen how the recovery of sulphur will be affected depending on Gunvor's decision on the refinery output.
Gunvor will retain the site as a refinery, but bitumen, base oils and waxes production have already been phased out as planned by the new owners. The second crude unit at the plant is now to run middle distillate rich crudes for the production of gasoil, diesel and jet fuel.

Belgium took receipt of the majority of the export volume at around 110,000, up 10pc on the year. Exports to Morocco totalled 65,000t in the first 11 months of last year up 535pc on 2014, while exports to Switzerland increased by 29pc on the year to total 13,000t.
Exports to France slipped 21pc to sit at around 68,000t for the January-November period and exports to the Nether- lands dropped 3pc to total 54,000t.
During November, Germany exported just over 25,000t, up 9pc on the prior-year period.

In the first 11 months of 2015, Russia exported just over 2.6mn t of sulphur, down 29pc on the prior-year period. One of the reasons was low water level at the Volga-Don river system last year that limited quantities to be exported.
Exports to its three biggest markets fell; Morocco slipped 29pc on the year, to total 955,000t, exports to Brazil dropped 21pc to 327,000t and exports to China fell 42pc to 324,000t.
Shipments to Lithuania totalled 198,000t, up 230pc on the same period in 2014. However, Argus FMB noticed that Lithuania turned to importing from other regions in the final quarter of the year because of reduced availability from GPE. Shipments to Israel also increased by 40pc to sit at 115,000t.
Russia exported just under 152,000t of sulphur in Novem- ber last year, down 42pc on the year, but up 38pc month-

believes prices are at a level that will inspire a rebound in demand.
"With the recent price volatility and decline in raw mate- rial costs, buyers appear to be delaying purchases. This is lengthening the seasonal period of weak demand," Mosaic senior vice president of commercial operations Rick McLel- lan said. "Today's crop nutrient prices, including phosphates, are attractive to farmers globally and we expect a strong demand response after this seasonally slow period."
The producer has a melter in Florida, which has melted small volumes of sulphur and yet to be running at full rates.
Canada
Price discussions for Vancouver exports are slipping to $95- 100/t fob according to traders.
Delivery of sulphur from Vancouver will be restricted in May, July and August this year. The Kinder Morgan Terminal (KMCT) will be shut down for maintenance 1-15 May, to be followed by turnaround works at the Pacific Coast Terminals from mid-July to mid-August.
Bomb threat at Come-By-Chance
On the morning of 28 January, the Royal Canadian Mountain Police responded to a bomb threat at the North Atlantic Refining refinery in Come-By-Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador. This is the second bomb threat to the 115,000 b/d refinery, following one in October 2015. The bomb threat procedure was activated and an extensive search of the refinery was conducted. Normal operations resumed shortly after the all clear was issued by North Atlantic Refining later that day and an investigation into the origin of the threat is reportedly ongoing.

Pemex acquires Mexican phosphate producer Fertinal
Mexican phosphate producer Fertinal confirmed that it has been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes, a subsidiary of the state-owned company.
"Today is time for a change of control, we confirm that Fertinal has officially been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes," Fertinal said in a letter to stakeholders and customers. "This acquisition will bring new opportunities for Fertinal due to the vertical integration of this Group in the chain production of gas–ammonia–fertilizer; this will allow Grupo Fertinal to
Issue 16-05  |  Thursday 4 February 2016
become a low cost producer and a stronger competitor."
The acquisition has been made official after Pemex reached an agreement to take over Fertinal in December.
Fertinal, Mexico's lone phosphate producer, had endured cash flow issues over the past two years because of a series of operational setbacks, combined with falling global phos- phate prices. The company's phosphate rock mine in Baja California Sur, Mexico, was impacted by a hurricane and a fire in late 2014, which decreased production.
Potential changes to Fertinal's sulphur and sulphuric acid procurement?
Fertinal is a consumer of sulphur and sulphuric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers. The company will continue to build "business relationships with current clients, contractors and suppliers", according to a recent statement, indicating its ways of procurement may not change substan- tially in the near term.
In 2015, the company imported around 445,000t of sulphur, and 180,000-185,000t of sulphuric acid via the port of Lazaro Cardenas. Most of its sulphur and sulphuric acid procurement in the past had been conducted via traders on a spot basis.
Sulphur is produced locally in Mexico from natural gas processing and oil refining, and all refineries in Mexico are owned by Pemex. At present the only outlets for Pemex's sulphur production are the domestic market or the move- ment of molten sulphur by vessel to the US for two key fertilizer producers: Mosaic and PotashCorp.
Logistical constraints had prevented Fertinal from receiv- ing significant quantities of sulphur from Pemex in the past. While it makes sense for Fertinal to be self-sufficient with Pemex's sulphur in the future, investments are needed to improve transportation to and from the Fertinal units and within Mexico.
If this happens, domestic trade flow may change and it may have a knock-on effect on the utilisation of Mexico's first sul- phur forming capacity, which is expected to come on stream in the first half of 2016 with capacity of 360,000 t/yr.
The forming unit is located at Coatzacoalcos in south Mexico on the Atlantic coast and is also owned by Pemex. Its start up should allow sulphur production unconsumed by the local market to move offshore. But its utilisation is subjected to change depending on Fertinal's future sulphur procurement

strategy.
As for sulphuric acid, Fertinal produces sulphur-based acid and augments its requirements with imports. The cargoes typically come from the Far East, delivered via chemical tankers and combo vessels (which is capable of transporting acid from Japan/South Korea to Latin America and copper concentrate on its voyage back).
Logistical disadvantages again made it more economical for Fertinal to import acid rather than receive domestic product via tanker trucks in the past.
With the acquisition, it remains to be seen if a partnership is possible with local smelter acid producer Southern Cop- per/Grupo Mexico. The company operates two mines that produces smelter acid in Mexico - La Caridad in Nacozari and Buenavista in Cananea, both in Sonora.
Another potential partnership could be with El Boleo, a copper producer that exported an estimated 200,000t of sulphur-based sulphuric acid via the port of Santa Rosalia to nearby markets in 2015.
Supplies from either Grupo Mexico or El Boleo will face a similar problem: high freight costs because of a limited number of chemical tankers serving the west coast of Latin America.
For now, Fertinal is estimated to be covered with sulphur and sulphuric acid until around March.
Jan-Nov sulphur imports up 69pc
Between January and November Mexico imported just under 538,000t of sulphur, an increase of 69pc on the prior-year period. Canada provided 55pc of the country's requirements in the first 11 months of 2015, totalling 298,000t, up 93pc on 2014 volumes. The US provided the remaining 240,000t, up 56pc on 2014 export volumes.
In November 2015, Mexico received just under 29,0000t of sulphur from the US.
Brazil
Mexico Sulphur Imports ’000t
Most of the quarterly price negotiations have been conclud- ed in Brazil in the range of $110-125/t cfr. The top end refers to cargoes closed between December and early January, while the more recent deals were finalised at the low end of the range.
For Vale, it is believed that one cargo has yet to be com- mitted out of Vale's estimated requirements of 293,000t for 1Q. The most recently finalised cargo is of US Gulf origin, thought to be concluded at around $100/t fob US Gulf. Freight is put at $12/t.
The most recent purchase by Anglo American is from Tram- mo, 35,000-39,000t for April arrival. The cargo is believed to be coming from Russia, concluded at $107/t cfr.
