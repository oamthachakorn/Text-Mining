UREA
ANALYSIS
Outlook mostly bearish despite some gains in US
Granular urea values gained just $4/st at New Orleans. Truckloads were a whopping $32/st more expensive in the Midwest where anecdotal reports suggest more warehouses are empty than carrying product. In the Southern Plains values were down $7/st from the prior week. Distributors here appear to have sufficient urea in the pipeline now to meet demand for rice, although much of it still is being trucked from the US Gulf and even the east side of the Mississippi River.
MARKETS
UREA
US Midwest: Late demand holding prices up
Granular urea has sold as high as $420/st FOB this week in the Midwest. Wet weather continues to force growers to choose urea for top-dress applications on corn acres rather than ammonia or UAN in some areas.
Nevertheless, urea demand in the region likely has little time left. Corn is reported to be silking in many areas. This is not unusual for the time of year, but it means the benefits of further nitrogen applications are reduced for the current crop. Weather-related delays to top-dress applications now mean some corn acres have not received the volume of nitrogen farmers might have preferred.
US S Plains: Truck prices come off peaks
Even though granular urea remains in short supply in the Southern Plains region, seasonal slow downs in demand have eliminated the peak prices seen in last week's market. This week Arkansas River quotes are $390-395/st FOB.
Travel up the Arkansas River by barge is beginning again. Early this week travel was limited to daylight hours only and tows generally were just made up of six barges, roughly half the typical load for tugs.
US NOLA: Broad range emerges as expected
By the end of the week confirmed business for granular urea available within a prompt window were spread out between $315-352/st FOB New Orleans, with the high end reflecting business conducted just after last week's close. Efforts to repeat business at the high end of the range did not succeed, but further business occured around $338/st FOB and multiple trades in the $320s/st FOB also were reported for 1H July.
At the end of the week some traders were bidding around $300/st FOB for prompt barges but transactions at this price tag could only be confirmed on forward business.
For months forward expectations of sharply lower prices have not come to fruition at New Orleans, as prompt demand has supported higher sales than indicated by prior forward business. Some sort of downward correction still seems very likely for 2H July-August, but August indications through FIS in the $280s/st FOB and confirmed physical trades in the $280s/st FOB for the same months would suggest that the bottom of the market is not substantially below recent market lows.
Market rumours regarding the start-up of CF's urea expansion at Donaldsonville, Louisiana are focused on late September or early October, at least for commercial rates. CF has not commented on this speculation.
US N Plains: Dakotas not reacting with other markets
Forward offers of granular urea are proving too much for distributors to fight when it comes to prompt pricing in the Dakotas. Postings do remain at $370/st DEL in places, but dry weather has hampered demand even before cheaper fill urea at around $345/st DEL was offered primarily from Canadian suppliers in prior weeks.
It is not possible to replace granular warehouse positions at values that reflect prices in the US Gulf, Midwest or Southern Plains markets on a prompt basis. But dry weather in the region has led to disappointing sales in recent weeks, likely leaving retailers in a position to get through remaining seasonal demand.
Canada, US Atlantic: Algerian cargo headed for 2 ports
A 25-30,000 mt cargo of granular urea from Algeria will load this month for Trammo, with discharges at Fairless and Contrecoeur.
Market sources indicate about 10,000 mt of the urea will discharge for Yara at the Canadian port. Much of the Trammo volume could be destined for Canada also by rail from Fairless. The price tag for the imports was about $325/mt CFR.
NITRATES & SULPHATES
MARKETS
UAN
US Midwest: Fill offers succeeded
CF Industries' fill offers for UAN brought buyers across the region to the table to commit material generally expected to ship mostly during Q3. Suppliers are expected to seek higher prices in Q4, but for now indications across the region likely will hold at $7.56-7.81/unit FOB.
Overall, CF's price list was more aggressive than many expected. However, it was roughly in line with indications released by small suppliers earlier in June. Aggressive pricing from all suppliers likely was needed for this year's fill as anecdotal reports suggest carryover UAN is greater than nomal, especially west of the Mississippi River.
AS
US S Plains: AS holding value as seasonal demand ends
Despite the somewhat disappointing reports regarding demand from the rice market this year due to adverse weather, seasonal demand for ammonium sulphate was sufficient to enable distributors to end June with minimal carryover.
Quotes for truckloads along the Arkansas River are $290-295/st FOB. This is just $5/st off the seasonal peak, when first nitrogen applications were moving to rice acres. However, prices in Texas and in parts of Oklahoma are cited $20/st or more below river terminals based on recent fill offers from producers.
US Midwest: Fill indications bring offers down
Fill offers from Honeywell and other US suppliers are reported at $270-280/st FOB across the region for granular product.
This is a huge drop from the sales values seen at the peak of spring demand, but the season was marked by spot outages and better than expected demand as some retailers and distributors moved away from ammonium nitrate.
AMMONIA
MARKETS
AMMONIA
US Midwest: Fill prices rule market
Even though regional buyers did not express anywhere near as much enthusiasm for fill and pre-pay ammonia, consistent reports to Fertilizer Week this week are that endusers booked as much ammonia as CF and other suppliers were willing to sell. One result is that the prompt market has moved roughly in line with fill offers from CF Industries and others at $550-560/st FOB.
Carryover ammonia is reported across the Midwest, due mostly to the uncooperative weather conditions. Despite this retailers generally were eager to make sure they go into the fall season with as much ammonia as they would normally carry. The $50-60/st price cut for the fill sales was more aggressive than many expected, but indicated producers' recognized the difficult financial math corn growers faced in the fertilizer year that just ended June 30.
US Gulf: Demand may have downs and ups
It is possible US Gulf demand may see some shifts downward before rebounding in August-September, depending on events outside of the supply chain to US DAP/MAP producers.
In the near term, demand for spot ammonia cargos to help refill the US direct application supply chain could easily be delayed, if reports reguarding lost sales this summer prove correct. Supposedly much of the carryover ammonia remains in the hands of retailers and distributors, which helps explain the fairly aggressive fill and pre-pay prices offered for the summer.
Looking farther ahead, marketplace scuttlebutt indicates CF could begin commercial production from its new Donaldsonville, Louisiana urea plant in late September or early October. That plant will rely on imported ammonia through Yara until Q1 or Q2 of next year when a supporting ammonia train will be completed at the CF complex.
PHOSPHATES
ANALYSIS
US DAP gains a little, but not enough for imports
This week’s roundup of phosphate activity echoes last week’s. Barge values moved up a little more as inland values remained flat. US prices remain too low to attract competition from overseas, so far. Some inland distributors are reporting Mosaic will not guarantee new purchases will be delivered before November, but this still should be in time for fall applications. DAP values in the US likely will be firm to higher in the near
term thanks to June 30 US Department of Agriculture reports that finally reflected earlier reports of reduced acres for corn.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
US: DAP/MAP inventories building at end of Q1
The January-March 2015 US phosphate producer data recently provided by The Fertilizer Institute show an increase in producers' inventories at the end of Q1. This was likely due to weaker year-over-year demand for DAP and MAP in the US due to fewer corn acres and wet weather that affected crop choices in some areas.
At the end of January - based on 100% of US capacity reporting - producers' DAP/MAP inventories were 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5), up 1% from the close of the previous month, and 28% above end January 2014.
The February data reflected the same trend, with 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5) in producers' inventory at month's end, unchanged on January but up by 24% against February 2014.
March 2015 inventories were 582,000 st P2O5 (527,987 mt P2O5), up by 2% on February and by 19% year on year. Inventory levels for each of the three months were above the monthly production rates of 413,000 st P2O5, 389,000 st P2O5 and 400,000 st P2O5 respectively.
Total production between July-March reached 3.68 million st P2O5 (3.34 million mt P2O5), an increase of
2% compared with the previous year. US producers' shipments in January of this year were 407,000 st P2O5 (369,208 mt P2O5), 11% less than December 2014 and 14% below January 2014.
February shipments were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt P2O5) 4% less than January 2015 but 7% more than the previous year. March shipments also were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt), even with February of this year but 8% less than March 2014. During the first nine months of the current US fertilizer year, July- March, US producers' shipments of DAP/MAP were 3.5 million st P2O5 (3.2 million mt P2O5), down 7% from the prior year period.
US NOLA: DAP barge quotes benefit from corn gains
Increases in prompt and forward corn prices are getting credit for higher DAP values this week at New Orleans. July barges were no lower than $425/st FOB at the end of the week, with Mosiac material selling at $430/st FOB and a trader sale setting the low end at $420/st FOB. Forward sales are cited at $426-428/st FOB. Offers from traders are creeping over $430/st FOB for August, but buyers have not been willing to support that price tag yet.
The bump in DAP values was creditied mostly to a more positive outlook for corn prices. The June 30 acreage and grain stocks reports generally were supportive of corn and even soybean values. Corn gained as much as $0.30/bushel June 30. However, by mid-day July 1, CME forward contract values through December 2015 were giving back $0.07-0.08/bushel of that gain.
MAP values are holding just $5-1/st above DAP at New Orleans, even though the supply picture for MAP going forward appears to be extremely tight.
US Midwest: Demand over, fill next concern
With seasonal applications of phosphate over and done with, distributors are looking at replacement costs for summer fill. Mosaic has stuck with its earlier indication of delivered values roughy in line with spot indications to retailers of $460/st FOB.
However, the barge market is gaining ground, and it is possible the producer's expected target of $440/st FOB New Orleans plus freight to inland destinations might be possible despite the disappointing spring season. For this to occur the recent jump in corn values based on revisions by the US Department of Agriculture's forecasts will have to hold.
US Tampa: Small sales continue
Mosaic reports sales of small lots of DAP this week into South America at $470/mt FOB Tampa for July shipment.
The price tag is at the bottom of the range seen in prior weeks. Substantial movement in the Tampa benchmark in either direction seems dependent on the extent of Brazilian buying in the coming weeks.
POTASH
MARKETS
MOP
US NOLA: BPC shipments for fall in question
BPC, which re-entered the US market in the just completed US fertilizer year, has said it is not committed to ship granular potash in time for the US fall season.
The producer cites reports of higher inventory levels in the US supply chain at the end of the spring, and the lower prices seen in the US since the start of the spring season.
Previously traders had hoped to buy 160-200,000 mt of BPC potash in time for US fall sales. Assuming no cargoes arrive in time for the annual closure of the upper Mississippi River in October, then there would be no requirement for BPC cargoes to reach the US until February in order to participate in the spring season.
In the meantime, granular potash barges are cited around $320/st FOB New Orleans.
US Midwest: Lack of interest keeps market flat
The main story in the region remains the lack of interest in booking substantial fall tons compared to prior years due to carryover. Comments from distributors vary, with the divide primarily between those reporting more-than-typical volumes of granular potash and those reporting normal inventories.
Demand generally was better in the Midwest through the spring application season compared to other major US markets. Postings remain at $335-365/st FOB.
