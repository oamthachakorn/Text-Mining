MARKET ANALYSIS
India becomes the market of choice but onus now on ammonia
By Sarah Marlow & BK Morris
The market is still reeling after the $40/mt P2O5 increase in phosphoric acid prices achieved this week in India by OCP for Q1 and Q2. Although a marginal increase had not been ruled out, few expected an increase of this magnitude particularly as the Indian phosphate industry remains constrained by cashflow issues arising from outstanding subsidy payments, the MRP limitations and an unchanged urea price.
On the upside though and the argument used to push through this increase is the fall in ammonia prices. Even with a lower ammonia cost, the higher acid price can be supported by the Indian industry only if the ammonia price falls to a level below $440/mt CFR and the INR does not weaken further. As such the cost position for the industry remains vulnerable and producers are therefore not expected to suddenly ramp up production as these variable factors could turn against them at any time.
Nevertheless, production will be maintained at a reasonable level through Q2 as the industry prepares for the Kharif but imported DAP will remain the preferred choice. However there is now concern that suppliers will start indicating higher DAP prices to move further in line with the latest acid price hike. A price of $500/mt CFR is being speculated for Saudi product with Chinese not far behind. Currently the breakeven point for importers is nearer $490/mt CFR with recent sales being concluded in the range of $480-488/mt CFR to ensure at least a minimal margin. An increase in price to $500/mt CFR would necessitate an increase in the farm-gate price or MRP to over INR 24,000/mt, not a move that the farmers, producers or government will undertake lightly if at all.
With India currently offering the best netbacks of the three major markets, India, Brazil and the US, Chinese producers are focussing their efforts on Asia over the Americas for new business for DAP and MAP 11-52-0. For the lesser grades, prices are more fluid as there are fewer export alternatives and they find some common ground for the Brazilian market.
On paper Mosaic and PotashCorp might be better off selling for export than in the US market. Export values to Central America equate to the mid-$420s/st at New Orleans. If India has to pay up to $500/mt CFR for DAP, then the return to Tampa would be $15/st more than than the high end of this week's New Orleans market of $415/st FOB.
Brazil is buying but progress is more slow and steady. Buyers yet again are achieving the best prices without allowing any unchecked import frenzy to drive prices up. As such the price range remains largely unchanged.
Highlights of the Week
OCP achieves $40/mt P2O5 increase in H1 Indian contracts Russian DAP sold in India in the low $480s/mt CFR
US barges fall close to $400/st FOB, but seller resistance emerging, export trade equates to mid $420/st in domestic market.
$10-12/mt increase in phosphate rock prices expected on the back of acid price
Ammonia parcel purchased in India below $440/mt CFR but will it stay there?
Short Term Outlook
PHOSPHATES | 3
Whereas many expect higher prices to be quoted in India over the coming weeks, in line with the higher phosacid price, the tone in Europe and the Americas remains decidedly weak. Will the two regions come back into balance or will the trend be reversed as it was last year when prices west of Suez were markedly stronger than their Indian counterparts. This year India has got off to a more bullish start, supported by low stocks while Brazil in particular has held back, a little more cautious in the face of lower crop prices.
There are two questions which will determine the outlook for Q2. The first is whether Brazilian demand will take off sufficiently over the next few weeks to absorb all the long positions building up in the market and secondly whether Indian demand is strong enough to withstand a hike in the MRP to INR 24,000/mt or more while urea prices remain unchanged.

Mosaic sells to Central America,
Tampa inches down
Mosaic reported selling another April cargo destined for Central America this week. The producer will load 17,000 mt of DAP/MAP for the customer at $470-475/mt FOB. Rumours have emerged of more business by the producer to Central America, believed to be at a similar price or based on an index.
There is speculation that Mosaic will begin exports to at least its own system in India this summer. Sales to Indian importers are not likely in the near term, as company sources insist Mosaic does not have tons to spare for that much business.
Meanwhile, demand in the South has been sufficient for truck sales to continue from Mosaic's Central Florida plants at $440-445/st FOB.
US MIDWEST
DAP holding ground in US Midwest as application season nears
Retailers and distributors report some DAP postings remain around $470/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River. Resupply is available through Iowa and the Twin Cities in Minnesota by barge, and lower replacement costs out of the US Gulf could weigh down the inland truck market in coming weeks.

US NOLA
Slide turns to collapse before DAP finds support at New Orleans
Prompt DAP barge demand has gone cold, as paper indications through the FIS cash-swap service moved to $390-398/st FOB New Orleans for May-June this week. As a result, a DAP barge changed hands at just $405/st FOB New Orleans before sellers dug in their heels.
Subsequent nearby DAP trades were reported from multiple players at $415/st FOB, while offers reached $420/st FOB late in the week. However, buyers had not accepted that price tag at press time. While most of the DAP trades were reported as domestic product, available MAP is dominated by imported material. Indications for
imported MAP are roughly in line with DAP.
Last week quotes for prompt and all-April DAP barges were $421- 435/st FOB New Orleans.
US SOUTHERN PLAINS
DAP applications wait for rain to end in South
Rain has continued throughout the week in much of the US marketplace in the South, keeping farmers from starting phosphate and other fertilizer applications for spring crops. It may take another week for many of the key growing areas to dry out sufficiently to support field work. This has reduced expectations for corn acres in the region, with farmers considering other crops. In the meantime, DAP price quotes are unchanged from last week.
ARGENTINA
Weekly Market Report
26 March 2015
while Saudi and South American product are said to be on offer into Argentina at nearer $490/mt CFR. Based on recent price indications for Chinese MAP 11-52-0, a price of $480/mt CFR would not be workable and would necessitate a sizeable drop in FOB values.
BRAZIL
Buyers playing a measured game, avoiding price surge
Import activity in Brazil is picking up but there has been no surge in buying and nor is there likely to be in the near future.
Buyers pick off what they need from the continuous stream of vessels offering tonnes from a wide variety of origins. This measured approach to the import season has meant that prices remain largely unchanged from last week, still in the range of $475-485/mt CFR, with some suggesting even lower numbers at $470/mt CFR and others quite clear that the market is well into the $480s/mt CFR.
Koch is said to have a PhosAgro DAP/MAP cargo for April loading, which currently is expected to find its way to Brazil although a number of potential destinations have been mentioned. Nitron has a March cargo loading in Saudi Arabia and Indagro has been linked with a South African MAP cargo. Eurochem tonnes are on offer and OCP will load its three MAP/DAP cargos this month and supply both Herringer and its own system without yet coming out with a firm price.
Mosaic has not indicated a new price for Brazil but its latest spot deal in Central America is another $5/mt lower than last week suggesting that the gap between US and Brazilian prifce ideas is getting smaller. With a FOB price at $470/mt, a landed price into Brazil for US product would equate to the upper $480s/mt CFR.
The lack of buying frenzy has resulted in buyers enjoying some of the lowest netbacks across the globe. India currently presents a far more attractive option for Chinese and Saudi suppliers and even Russian DAP is now being diverted there rather than the Americas.
For 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 there are fewer viable alternatives. Buyers are bidding $380/mt CFR for 11-44-0 which is currently on offer at $360-365/mt FOB China. With freights in the low $20s and a trader's margin, the gap between buyers and sellers is around $10-
12/mt. Offers of 10-50-0 have been made in the $440s/mt CFR.
Buyers retreat for now but will be back again for H2 April
After the recent flurry of purchasing, most importers in Argentina are now covered through H1 April for DAP/MAP requirements and can take some breathing space before returning for H2 April shipment.
Recent sales include a DAP/MAP cargo for April shipment with open origin, potentially Mexican or Russian, with most priced in the upper $480s but a small parcel has also been sold at around $490/mt CFR.
Chinese MAP has been offered in the low $480s/mt CFR
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
India and Far East attract Russian DAP, NPKs
The sale into India of a panamax cargo of DAP suggests a netback below $460/mt FOB Baltic for PhosAgro given a freight in the low $20s and allowing for some trader margin. Potential sales into the Americas would give a netback at even lower levels, especially given prevailing barge values at NOLA.
PHOSPHATES | 5
In Europe the price remains weak to stable with official prices at Terneuzen at $545 but reports of sales concluded at lower levels. Renewed strength in the euro this week has brought some relief to buyers and in Germany, where the season has not yet ended, there are signs of some tentative recovery in demand. This will be of benefit to Eurochem's Lithuanian duty free DAP rather than Russian which is finding its way to other non-European destinations.
PhosAgro DAP has been reported on offer in Vietnam this week also but at too high a price to attract any serious interest. Koch is said to be taking an April PhosAgro cargo to Brazil although the destination may yet not be set in stone.
With OCP bringing on its new 1 million mt integrated granulation plant next month, Russian NP/NPK business will become ever more vulnerable to competition from Morocco, particularly in Africa. As such it is possible that we will see increased Russian (PhosAgro and Acron) activity in the Indian DAP and NPK market, a market
that Russian producers have foregone in the last two years, preferring to develop new NPK markets elsewhere, but which may start to look more attractive in 2015.
EUROPE
Spring season over in south; tentative improvement in north
The market south of Germany is all but over. In Italy the season is long over and tonnes lie unsold, brought in during February from North Africa and Lithuania and finding little buying interest with the weak euro and lack of demand. Even with lower prices being indicated in recent weeks, nearer $510-515/mt FOB North Africa and $520/mt CFR duty paid for Lithuanian, little interest has been shown.
In France the season has ended early after an exceptionally poor last few weeks, due to higher prices and weak currency. No further DAP imports are expected.
Only in northern Europe, namely Germany, is there any real interest and even here it is limited. The season will continue through to mid April with corn application traditionally starting on April 20. There are signs that the slightly stronger euro this week has prompted a little more interest in DAP. Official prices at Terneuezen remain at $545/mt FCA but a more realistic price range is $535-545/mt FCA.

Negotiations are underway between Gubretas and GCT for this year's annual phosphate supply contract. Prior to the troubles in 2011, GCT would ship more than 300,000 mt DAP into Turkey per year. Since then, annual volumes have been significantly lower. In 2014 just 90,000 mt DAP was imported into Turkey from Tunisia along with 11,000 mt MAP and 41,000 mt P2O5 phosphoric acid.

India remains the market of choice for Chinese DAP
All eyes are on China to see whether DAP producers raise their prices to India on the back of the increase in phosacid prices achieved this week. Some speculate that the hike in acid prices will necessitate an increase in the MRP which in turn will prompt suppliers to take advantage of this and raise prices to over $490/mt CFR.
In the meantime more sales to India in the low $480s/mt CFR have been reported this week, giving a netback in the mid-high $460s/$470/mt FOB range depending on size of cargo.
Indiacations for 11-52-0 and DAP for Latin America are far less attrractive with potential netbacks in the $450s/mt FOB China. As such Chinese suppliers will continue to target DAP sales to India over 11-52-0 sales into the Americas.
Prices have declined for granular 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 due to the lack of better sales opportunities outside Latin America. Recent price indications for 10-50-0 have been around the $415/mt FOB level while 11-44-0 is in the range of $360-365/mt FOB for April loading.
February DAP output down again, 37% rise in NP/NPKs
The latest FAI data show February DAP production at 320,000 mt which, although well above the average monthly output for the year, remained below the volume produced in both January this year and February last year.
Total DAP production therefore for April-February was 3.08 million mt, some 7% below 2013/14 and 12% below the average for the previous 5 years.
By contrast, NP/NPK production in February totalled 620,000 mt, more than 35% higher than the 470,000 mt produced in February 2014 but less than in January this year.
Overall NP/NPK production for the year to date has reached 7.3 million mt, some 12% above the same period last year but remaining in line with the 5 year average.
Production of all the major NP and NPK grades increased both in February and over the year to date when compared with 2013/14. Production of 20-20-0 went up by 12% to reach 2.76 million mt by the end of February while production of 12-32-16 and 10-26-26 went up by 42% and 14% respectively.
Import data for DAP show the overall total for the fertilizer year to date at 3.72 million mt, up by 460,000 mt compared with 2013/14.
Sales of DAP during February were in line with February last year, at 358,000 mt but the overall total for April-February has been reported at a higher volume of 6.76 million mt compared with 6.17 million mt last year.
Sales of complex
fertilizers, excluding DAP, were also reported higher by the FAI this year at 6.6 million mt at the end of February, up from 6.4 million mt in 2013/14.
FAI stock data show closing stocks of DAP at 365,000 mt at the end of February, an increase on the previous two months but still below last year's level of 745,000 mt. By contrast, stocks of NP/NPKs, as measured by the FAI, are reported at 770,000 mt, up from previous months and also up on last year's stock level of 632,000 mt at the same time of year.
A delegation of Chinese producers met in India with officials to discuss the current FCO regulations with regard to the specifications of imported DAP. Currently imported DAP is only eligible for a subsidy if it meets the FCO requirements of 18-46-
0.The N content can be slightly less but can not go below 17.5% or the product will not be eligible for the DAP subsidy. Instead it would have to be either re-exported or used as a raw material in the manufacture of other phosphate products. The level of water solubility has also been under discussion.
Around 800,000 mt DAP already booked for India
Close to 800,000 mt DAP have been booked for shipment to India for the coming fertilizer year. Not all the cargoes have been priced but discussions are ongoing to finalise these sales.
One interesting development has been the sale of Russian DAP through Rare Earth to IFFCO for April shipment (see table below for details). This follows the sale of a small parcel of Russian DAP from PhosAgro in combination with 10-26-26 sold earlier to IPL. These DAP sales mark the first Russian DAP sold into India since 2012.
Other new sales that have come to light this week include a 45,000 mt cargo purchased by MCFL from Aries/Kailin for April shipment with 10,000 mt AS, at a price in line with recent sales, i.e in the low $480s/mt CFR. Chambal/Zuari will share a 70,000 mt cargo from Aries/Kailin and this has also been priced at a similar level. Chambal will take further cargoes from YUC against its MoU for 500,000 mt but as yet a price has not been confirmed.
KRIBHCO has confirmed that it has booked 40,000 mt DAP from Ma'aden for April shipment against its MoU for 250,000 mt. Ma'aden has indicated a price of $490/mt CFR but the final price has not yet been confirmed.
The $40/mt P2O5 hike in the phosphoric acid price will push the Indian market further towards the import market for DAP given the widening disparity in price between imported and indigenous product based on imported phosphoric acid. With few expecting any significant increase in domestic DAP prices, given that urea prices are to remain unchanged for 2015/16, the industry may continue to produce higher analysis P2O5 products at lower levels through Q2 compared with previous years.
What could prompt a switch back towards a higher domestic DAP output could be a further decrease in ammonia prices. In the meantime, the industry is likely to continue favouring imported DAP as long as suppliers do not use the hike in acid prices as an excuse to hike their price ideas for DAP, already an area of concern to the market.

Fauji is producing at stable levels, between 60-65,000 mt DAP per month. The higher acid price agreed in India for Q2 will filter through to production costs and eventually prices in Pakistan with Fauji's acid coming from its joint venture with OCP in Morocco. Currently domestic prices are depressed, being the off-season, and some PKR 80-90/50kg bag below costs.

Bangladesh and India took 65,000 mt each in February with a further 50,000 mt reported as loading for the US.

OCP achieves $40/mt P2O5 increase in H1 Indian phosacid price
OCP has achieved a $40/mt P2O5 increase in the Indian phosphoric acid price for H1 2015, January-June, compared with the price of $765/mt P2O5 in H2 2014. This increases the low end of the FOB Morocco price range accordingly.
The justification for pushing through such an increase is said to be due to the weaker ammonia price and the expectation that it will weaken further in India to enable Indian DAP producers to afford the higher phosacid price. If lower ammonia prices are achieved in India, OCP will step up its acid shipments once again after the relatively low quantities shipped in Q1of just 1-2 cargoes per month to its joint venture partners, PPL, Zuari and TCL.
The rationale for the increase is also to drive through a corresponding increase in the phosphate rock price. A number of rock contracts are based on the Indian phosacid price and as such we can expect to see an increase of between $10-12/mt sought for these Q2 rock contracts.

the acid price with suppliers using this formula to look for an increase of $10-15/mt on rock. Producers in turn will attempt to push down sulphur prices but even with higher rock costs and a stable sulphur price, the production of indigenous DAP through the phosphate rock route remains a more attractive option to that of using imported phosacid.
The current price for imported DAP is still in the low $480s/mt CFR for Chinese product, giving importers a margin of around 1-2%. The equivalent price for imported DAP based on the latest acid price, and ammonia at an average of $440/mt CFR, is close to $500/mt
CFR. With ammonia back up at $480/mt CFR or more, the equivalent DAP price for producers importing phosacid would be over $510/mt CFR.
Madras Fertilizers Ltd. issued a tender for 10,000 mt solution, closing on April 6 for May delivery.

DAP producers' profitablility depends on lower ammonia costs
The new H1 phosphoric acid price has been confirmed at $805/mt P2O5 CFR with 30 days credit, as reported earlier in the week by Fertilizer Week. This represents an increase of $40/mt P2O5 on the price agreed for H2 2014 of $765/mt CFR with 30 days credit.
This new price covers both Q1 and Q2 2015, eg January-
June. Negotiations will take place in July for a new Q3 contract price.
A price of $805/mt P2O5 CFR at the current subsidy rate, ammonia price of $480/mt CFR and exchange rate, equates to an estimated farm-gate price for DAP of INR 24,500/mt. The MRP for most suppliers is currently around INR 23,400-INR 23,500. As urea prices remain unchanged, few will want to push DAP
prices much higher and will be extremely reluctant to increase them above the INR 24,000/mt level. Government approval is still needed to ensure prices are maintained at a "reasonable level".
However, the ammonia price has become the most significant factor in this negotiation. Taking a theoretical average ammonia price of $440/mt CFR, the estimated cost of producing DAP using imported phosacid comes down to just under INR 24,000/mt.
Nevertheless, to make this workable for the industry, this would necessitate an increase in the MRP to a minimum of INR 24,000 plus ammonia prices to settle at this level or lower through Q2. There are reports of a purchase as low as $430/mt CFR but it remains to be seen whether this marks a sustained decline or whether prices from the Middle East will settle at a higher level over the coming weeks.
With the rupee still looking vulnerable, the industry may prefer to maintain a more conservative level of production through Q2 and make up any shortfall through imports. With ammonia looking cheaper at the moment though, and the likelihood of an increase in potash prices, production of a product such as 20-20-0 begins to look the most attractive.
Still, for those producers using phosphate rock and sulphur, a corresponding increase in rock prices is expected to follow

Egypt poised to export first high- grade rock
Egypt is poised to become an exporter of higher grade rock for the first time in its history.
In October, Fertilizer Week reported that Misr Phosphate was awarded a licence by the Egyptian government to operate the Red Sea Mine. The licence for the site, located around 80 km from the El Nasr mine, was previously held by Red Sea Mining Corporation. Misr Phosphate will receive a percentage of the sales revenue from the mine.
Misr began management of the site in September 2014 and plans to increase production to as much as 100,000 mt/month phosphate rock (30-32% P2O5 or 66-70% BPL). There are currently stocks at the mine of about 250,000 mt.
Egypt has taken steps to become more competitive in the global phosphate rock market by redistributing some mining licences. The country has only ever exported lower-grade rock, with a maximum P2O5 content of 30%.
One Egyptian trader said negotiations are already taking place to supply India with rock from the Red Sea Mine and a price of $93 FOB Egypt had been floated. Egypt plans to compete with Jordan and Morocco and price itself accordingly, he said.
Misr Phosphate declined to comment on price and a source said no large-volume contract with India had been agreed.

China's NPK imports near 200,000 mt in 2015
China imported 192,351 mt of NPKs in January and February, more than double the 85,446 mt imported during the same period in 2013, according to GTIS data.
China received 45% of the NPKs from Yara, while 24% came from Russian producers and 12% from Belgian producers. Romanian and Finnish producers also sent volumes exceeding 10,000 mt.
Chinese NPK demand was very strong in 2014 but NPK imports fell to 1.1 million mt from 1.3 million mt in 2013, partly due to increased domestic supply. With some small Chinese NPK plants down during March due to environmental concerns, NPK imports in March may have also had to increase compared to normal.
MALAYSIA
Malaysia's full year NPK exports more than double
Malaysia exported 220,564 mt of NPKs in the full year 2014, more than double the 98,504 mt it exported in 2013, according to GTIS data.
More than 200,000 mt of the exports went to Indonesia, with small volumes also going to Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
Malaysia imported 331,141 mt of NPKs in the full year 2014, largely flat against its 2013 imports.
The countryâ€™s trade flow was similar to previous years with NPKs from Belgium and Holland making up roughly 40% of the exports. Indian, Russian, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Norwegian, Chinese and Swiss producers all sent volumes exceeding 10,000 mt to Malaysia in 2014.
Palm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and following flooding in the first quarter of 2015, NPK imports may fall in upcoming January and February data compared to 2014.
