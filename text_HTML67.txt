ANALYSIS
French UAN creeps higher but sales slow
UAN
Sales of UAN-30 into Rouen have slowed substantially due in part to recent buying and higher prices. Values edged up to €196-197/mt FCA although sellers failed to secure deals at €198/mt FCA. Business is expected to be slow over the coming month.
GrodnoAzot’s June 12 UAN-32 for 25,000 mt is expected to provide indications on forward price direction.
US buyers were rewarded for their patience over the last couple of months, with purchases for the East Coast as low as $220/mt CFR and to New Orleans at $222/mt CFR from Russia.
Ammonium sulphate
The AS market is extremely quiet with TCCC’s purchase of 10,000 mt caprolactam grade product from a trader, likely Quantum in the low $150s/mt CFR the notable fixture. Chinese netbacks are suggested in the low $130s/mt FOB basis freight, costs and a small margin to the trader.
Brazilian buyers continue to enquire after AS with reported offers at $170/mt CFR from suppliers proving unattractive.
US endusers in the South are paying more for AS as demand for rice peaks.
Ammonium nitrate/CAN
Evidently satisfied with sales against the May 18 summer-posting, Yara lifted prices for AN and CAN in France June 10 with immediate effect. The AN price was raised to €292/mt CPT and the CAN was posted at €237/mt CPT.
There was also some more interest evident in FSU AN with Moroccan buyers paying up to $210-212/mt FOB equivalent for small parcels to load in June. Mainstream buying interest remains closer to $200-205/mt FOB, but the average netbacks for the week have been raised to reflect the North African deals.
The battle relating to cutbacks in Ukranian availabilty via Group DF closures of output at Cherkassy and RivneAzot continues amidst suggestion of attempted nationalization of the units by the Ukrainan government. A Group DF spokesperson did however reiterate this week that the Group remains in control, and even suggested a possible restart at Cherkassy in July.
Offers for Iranian AN are meanwhile reappearing in key markets, including Turkey, and recent shipping enquiries include a cargo of 12-15,000 mt AN in big-bags to load from Bandar Abbas to Vizag in India at the end of June.
MARKETS
UAN
NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: Import prices pull down barge offers
Offers of UAN-32 barges are cited a couple of dollars either side of $210/st FOB New Orleans this week, due in part to aggressive import offers.
However, suppliers have been disappointed with orders for the secondary application market in the US interior so far. Inland distributors are buying, but concerns that forward prices will decline have made them more conservative with regard to volumes.
Meanwhile, EuroChem will discharge about 30,000 mt of UAN-32 at New Orleans in 2H July. The price tag is around $222/mt CFR, with two buyers believed to be splitting the cargo. PotashCorp is reported to be offering spot barges from its plant at Geismar Louisiana plant around $210/st FOB.
US Midwest: Fill numbers create more drag on prices
More UAN fill pricing is emerging for summer delivery in the US Midwest, which likely will drag down price indications for remaining prompt business in coming days and weeks. Rentech is offering as low as $7.66/unit FOB ($245/st) from its plant at East Dubuque Illinois for orders of at least 5,000 st.
The UAN is not available before July 15, outside of the prompt window. Nevertheless, many traders believe the price will begin to influence endusers seeking prompt UAN for the tail end of the region's top-dress season.
In the meantime, distributors still were posting $9.22-9.63/unit FOB for nearby purchases.
US Atlantic: Vessel prices down on EuroChem sales
Two UAN-32 cargos each discharging at two ports on the Atlantic Coast have been sold by EuroChem to multiple buyers.
The first vessel arriving at the end of this month was sold at $220/mt CFR, the second will arrive in the first half of July and was sold at $235/mt CFR. Both cargos are believed to be about 30,000 mt.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Belarus: GrodnoAzot to close UAN tender June 12
GrodnoAzot will close a tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32 June 12.
Few sales have been concluded in the UAN market this past week, consequently prices in the tender are expected to provide indications on forward price direction.
EUROPE
France: Rouen values edge up a little bit
Values for UAN-32 in Rouen edged up to €196-197/mt FCA although attempts to sell at €198/mt FCA were swiftly rebuffed.
Sales have been slow over the past week and are expected to remain so over the coming month with much demand already covered.

NORTH AMERICA
US S Plains: Demand for AS jumping for rice market
Demand for ammonium sulphate is jumping, primarily for the rice markets in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, but also in states along the lower Mississippi River and for some other crops.
The price range from river terminals and inland warehouses has moved up to $290-300/st FOB, with some postings as high as $310/st FOB. The most common quotes are about $12.50/st above postings seen in prior weeks.
US: April imports do nothing to help shortfall
April imports of ammonium sulphate did nothing to alleviate the shortfall of that product that has been apparent since the start of the New Year, although year-over-year imports are higher. The shortage is blamed on domestic production problems, mostly centered on Honeywell's Hopewell Virginia facility, although the company has yet to confirm the extent of interruptions.
According to the US Department of Commerce, April imports of AS were 50,959 st (46,230 mt), slightly below the April 2014 volume of 55,492 st (50,342 mt). As has been the case for much of the first 10 months of the US fertilizer year through April, key suppliers for the most recent month were China at 29,450 st and Canada at 20,687 st.
During July-April US AS imports were 429,106 st (389,282 mt), up from 338,290 st (306,895 mt). Key AS suppliers during the current US fertilizer year so far have been China at 217,835 st and Canada at 208,416 st.
EUROPE
Turkey: Offtake of Chinese AS continues to climb
Turkish ammonium sulphate (AS) imports climbed 28.4% in April 2015 to 94,718 mt for steel and caprolactam AS grades, boosted by increased offtake of Chinese product.
Imports from China reached 47,720 mt for that month, an increase of 28% y-o-y. Offtake of Belarusian product also recovered at 26,189 mt, up over 500% y-o-y but more or less in line with volumes recorded in April 2013.
Total volumes imported in January-April stood at 361,102 mt, up 40% on 2014, once again largely supplemented by Chinese product. Imports from China for that period ran to 238,967 mt, up 433% on the same period in 2014.
Chinese caprolactam AS is growing in popularity in markets such as Turkey and Brazil given that is competitively priced and generally of good quality. Steel grade AS from China has also been secured by Turkish importers although Black Sea product is still sought after due to significant quality issues with recent arrivals from China.

Thailand: TCCC buys 10,000 mt caprolactam grade AS
TCCC has secured 10,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for early July shipment reported in the low $150s/mt CFR from a trader, reportedly Quantum. Chinese netbacks are suggested in the low $130s/mt FOB basis freight, costs and a small margin to the trader.

US: AN imports pace prior year, exports ahead
Ammonium nitrate imports in April were just 31,926 st (28,990 mt), down sharply from 70,403 st (63,869 mt) one year earlier, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. The April decline was not a major issue to the overall US import rate for the first 10 months of the fertilizer year through April, as the current year outpaced the prior period's 485,102 st (440,082 mt) to 471,116 st (427,394 mt).
Almost all of the April imports - 31,514 st - arrived from Canada. The difference between the prior year’s arrivals and the most recent month was seen in the absence of key suppliers Georgia and the Netherlands from the import line up. One year earlier those countries supplied 27,370 st and 16,521 st respectively.
US AN exports through April closely parallel the current year’s imports, but are moderately ahead of the prior fertilizer year. April shipments out of the US were 35,606 st (32,301 mt), slightly lower than the 38,950 st exported one year earlier. April 2015 exports followed the traditional pattern with almost all US AN loaded for Canada and Mexico at 27,229 st and 8,377 st respectively.
AN exports during July-April were 410,926 st (372,790 mt), up nearly 12% from the prior year period total of 367,361 st (333,268 mt). There has been no significant shift in export customers for US AN, although Guatemala bought 23,800 st of AN from the US in the first 10 months of the fertilizer year, up from 8,093 st during the prior year period. More traditional large buyers of US AN during July-April were Canada at 241,321 st and Mexico at 88,201 st.
EUROPE
France: Yara posts AN and CAN higher
Yara posted AN and CAN in France higher June 10 with immediate effect. The producer lifted the quote for AN 33.5% N by €7/mt to €292/mt CPT from its May 18 announcement. CAN 27% N was posted at €237/mt CPT.
Turkey: AN imports through April down 61.3%
Turkish imports of ammonium nitrate (AN) through April at 106,300 mt as identified by customs via GTIS were off by 61.3% on January-April 2014.
This is despite April imports of 18,400 mt which were up by 63% on the prior year. April imports from Russia of 12,200 mt were up from 100 mt in April 2014 while arrivals from Egypt of 2,200 mt were down by 51.7%.
January-April arrivals from Russia of 41,000 mt were down by 66% and deliveries from Georgia of 26,700 mt were off by 31%. Arrivals from Bulgaria of 11,400 mt were up by 300% while shipments from Iran of 9,200 mt were down by 76%. Egypt accounted for 8,200 mt, down by 57%. Arrivals from Romania were down to zero from 20,000 mt in 2014, and deliveries from Ukraine were down from 9,500 mt in 2014, also to zero in 2015.
