MARKET ANALYSIS
French UAN suppliers buy up more prompt tonnes
By Jennifer Willis-Jones
UAN
Pressure on UAN supplies increased as a number of French UAN suppliers reported empty tanks. Vessels carrying cargo purchased some weeks ago were delayed and meant some distributors secured additional prompt tonnes at €228-230/mt FCA to meet ongoing demand from farmers. Despite failing to lift prices further, suppliers will have pleased by the euro trading marginally above $1.10 March 26, up from about $1.06 March 19.
Scarcely any other UAN trade was noted as buyers remain reluctant to secure additional tonnage that may well be delivered after the key application seasons. Grodno scrapped its 25,000 mt UAN for March/April shipment on March 24 after receiving bids well below $220mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent, some $30/mt lower than it had anticipated, while Abu Qir failed to sell 27,500 mt UAN-32 which it tendered March 25. The supplier is now reported to be offering the cargo to traders via negotiations.
In the US barge UAN-32 values at New Orleans are steady to slightly lower, but this is mostly because suppliers and endusers are $5-20/st apart on pricing full tows for movement to the Midwest. The recent plunge in US urea pricing should put pressure on UAN sellers, but they likely will wait for more substantial demand before giving ground on their prices.
Ammonium sulphate
Limited activity has been noted across the AS market this week with Chinese suppliers still offering caprolactam grade product at $128- 130/mt FOB. Steel grade is offered nearer $122-123/mt FOB.
NITRATES AND SULPHATE | 2
Grodno’s 25,000 mt AS export tender for March-April shipment that closed March 24 failed to yield much interest with bids for small quantities reported submitted from neighbouring countries in the mid $130/mt FOB.
Black Sea AS prices remain stagnant with small volumes of steel grade still trading in the low $130s/mt FOB. Caprolactam grade product is still assessed in the low $150s/mt FOB although a lack of product availability means little if any product has been sold lately.
Ammonium nitrate/CAN
As had been predicted, AN and CAN values continue to slide outside Europe, and there is no end in sight in the short term for material loading from the FSU to highly competitive markets such as Brazil and Turkey. Rapidly sliding urea prices and heavy inventories from prior imports are set to continue to excert downward pressure on the two grades.

US CALIFORNIA
UAN cargo from China headed for California
Trammo is expected to discharge 27,500 mt of UAN-32 in California during April. The cargo likely has been resold to other buyers, however neither the CFR California nor FOB China price was available at press time. Rail delivered UAN in California is indicated at $9.70/unit FOB on a short ton basis.
US MIDWEST
US Midwest storage filled, sellers waiting for demand
UAN suppliers have met most of their shipment obligations to Midwest distributors and retailers, leaving tanks on both sides of the Mississippi River filled until demand emerges. Most of that demand will have to wait until corn is planted and emerging. Distributors report they are reluctant to commit to forward barge loads or unit trains in anticipation of later demand. This is not because they have any doubts that further volumes will be needed, but because they are convinced prices will soften due to competition from progressivly cheaper granular urea. For now, quotes of UAN to retailers
remain around $10/unit FOB.
US NOLA
Indications shaky for UAN barges
Reports of demand and price indications vary substantially this week

for UAN-32 barges. While some suppliers saw no demand available above $255/st FOB New Orleans, others cited sales around $257- 262/st FOB.
For now most suppliers are holding out above the lowest bids, and more serious interest is hoped for in coming days and weeks now that the upper Mississippi River is open through to the Twin Cities in Minnesota. However, inland distributors are more likely to turn to truck suppliers in the near term for resupply.

Grodno scraps UAN tender
Reports suggest Grodno scrapped its 25,000 mt UAN for March/April shipment on March 24 after receiving bids well below $220mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent, some $30/mt lower than the target set ahead of the session.
EUROPE
FRANCE
Ongoing optimism in French UAN market
A number of French UAN suppliers reported empty tanks this week and were eagerly anticipating the arrival of vessels carrying cargo purchased some weeks ago. Some suppliers keen to meet ongoing demand from farmers secured additional prompt tonnes at €228- 230/mt FCA. Sellers are still keen to push prices up further but will have been cheered by the euro trading marginally above $1.10 March 26, up from about $1.06 March 19.

Latest Abu Qir tender fails to trigger bids
No bids were received in the Abu Qir sales tender for 27,500 mt UAN-32 which closed March 25. Traders had suggested it might be difficult to sell the cargo in Europe given that the tonnes might arrive too late for the current application season.
The supplier is now reported to be offering the cargo to traders via negotiations.
The producer last sold a 25,000 mt UAN-32 parcel February 17 at
$239.50/mt FOB, down $11.50/mt FOB on its previous sale under its February 12 tender.
AN

BRAZIL
Importers unwilling to commit to more
AN
Brazilian importers of AN continue to hold off on additional purchases, citing excessive premiums for nitrate nitrogen versus N content in urea. Offers for granular urea down to $285/mt CFR reflect a $6.20/unit N value while offers for AN around $275/mt CFR
are indicative of $8.10/unit N for nitrate premiums still in excess of 30%.
FSU sellers that did adjust offers to the $275/mt CFR number in recent weeks are yet to concede further substantial discounts, but these seem inevitable for the sellers to secure additional business unless urea prices were to rebound substantially. Interest indicated from buyers is closer to $250/mt CFR.

EUROPE
TURKEY
Domestic AN and CAN prices in Turkey lower
Most recent quotes for AN from the domestic Turkish industry and from Turkish importers with existing inventories of AN are around TRY 855/mt FCA in bags.
The Turkish currency traded today at TRY 2.60 against the US dollar. Deducting VAT at 18%, handling/bagging/transport at a $17/mt equivalent, and adjusting for 6.5% import duty, the offers reflect a value for imported material around $245/mt CIF, or about $225/mt FOB from the Black Sea with no provisions for margins for the sellers.
Offers for CAN are posted at TRY 725/mt FCA. Applying the same cost factors on Ukrainian CAN which is exempt from the 6.5% duty, the calculation projects a delivered value of about $220/mt CIF, or around $200/mt FOB Black Sea.
This environment is obviously not conducive for additional imports based on quotes for AN from the Black Sea around an even $250/mt FOB and quotes at similar numbers for CAN.

Chinese AN exports decline
Exports of ammonium nitrate from China in February identified by customs via GTIS close to 22,000 mt were down by 45.6% on February 2014.
Cumulative January-February exports of 62,000 mt were down by 25% from the same months in 2014. Vietnam accounted for 16,000 mt of the 2015 exports, down by 15.7% while deliveries to Indonesia were up by 63% to 10,500 mt. Exports to Australia were down from 33,000 mt in 2014 to a mere 4,000 mt in 2015.
Brazilian buyer looks for caprolactam grade AS
An enquiry for 25,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for the Brazilian market circulated this week with buyers seeking as low as $145/mt CFR. Prices are assessed nearer $155-165/mt CFR.

Scarce caprolactam grade AS availability prevails
Little activity was reported out of the Black Sea with low availability of caprolactam grade AS prevailing. Prices remain pegged in the low $150s/mt FOB.

Small volumes of steel grade AS were offered this week with prices unchanged in the low $130s/mt FOB.
