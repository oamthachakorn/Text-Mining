Fertilizer Shipping Market Report
29th June – 3rd July 2015
Both basins has slowed down this week due to oversupply of tonnage. The general number of cargos also declined a tick although several fertilizer requirements can be seen in the Pacific and in Atlantic. In south East Asia however, with the coming Ramadan holiday, more coal cargoes appeared which has assisted the numbers to remain at a balanced level and in some cases the rates have even improved. Current rates remains fairly balanced.
Outlook: =
We expect the Far East to stabilize, and south East Asia is likely to continue its short run for another week, while Atlantic should stay flat at
today’s levels.
PANAMAX
Current trend: /UP
This week remained active with plenty of spot cargos in both basins which has improved the time charter rates on several routes. Far east was busy with spot cargoes from China & Indonesia and the Atlantic market also stayed relatively active. There was limited interest for short period but rates appeared to have improved from last done on a few deals.
.
Outlook: / UP
Mixed feelings as there are no clear indicators whether market will be going up or would remain flat. However looking at the recent trends we believe there could be few short term spikes to come.
