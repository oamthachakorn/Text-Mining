Market Summary
Market firmer on Indian demand
All eyes are on India and the upcoming STC tender on Friday 19 June. As a result the market has entered a hiatus, wait- ing for direction from Indian offers. Prices have seen little movement but the market has adopted a distinctly firmer tone on the back of prospective Indian demand. There is sentiment that given a recovery in the monsoon and low stocks, Indian demand under this tender is substantial at around 1mn t. Moreover, awards totalling 175,000t have still to receive vessel nominations under the last tender. This could lend support to Chinese, Yuzhny and the Arab Gulf given that the cargoes have to be shipped by 27 July.
The key question is at what price. Availability out of China remains a key discussion point for India. But it seems pretty clear that with Iranian supply estimated at 150,000-160,000t for India in July, plus 2-3 AG cargoes at most, there seems to be little sign of Chinese resolve weakening on prices - in fact just the opposite. However, the concern is that some short offers will be aggressive into India. Even if the ability to get backing at low numbers proves to be be extremely difficult, India's ability to secure tonnage at lower prices means it may not source all it needs. This raises the spectre of additional tenders heading into Q3.
Chinese port stocks remain relatively low at just over 400,000t and the domestic market will be active into July,

delayed due to weather. With port stocks low and few trader longs evident, fresh tonnage needs 2-3 weeks to move from the factories to the ports. The expectation is that China will provide at least 500,000-600,000t urea in the tender, providing some short term support to prices.
In terms of actual trade, there was limited activity this week. Ballance New Zealand issued a snap tender for granu- lar urea while TFC Taiwan awarded a small prilled tender in the mid-$310s/t cfr. Korea will tender on 19 June for a small lot of prills. In Sri Lanka, Dreymoor is understood to have been awarded under the last tender and a new tender has reportedly been announced.
Looking forward, the market appears to be stable-to-firm on the basis of Indian demand. However, it is India's ability to source at prices acceptable to suppliers that will be key to how the market develops in early Q3.

Tuapse line-up June 2015
Urea
Black Sea
EuroChem is targeting $305-310/t fob for July shipment for granular and $295-300/t fob for prills. No new sales are reported this week.
Baltic
Grodno Azot has announced sales tenders for up to 25,000t of prilled urea and up to 15,000t of granular urea for June- July shipment, closing on 22 and 23 June respectively.
No new sales are reported out of the Baltic this week. The last business remains UralChem's sale of 20,000t of prills to Mexico in the high-$280s/t fob Baltic. Asking prices for prills are reported around $298/t fob for small lots. Traders believe sub-$290/t fob is possible for early July loaders of 20-25,000t.
Europe
Germany
Yara’s ammonia unit in Brunsbüttel suffered a fire on 10 June. There were no casualties or serious injuries and dam- age to the plant was minimal, Yara said. The 750,000t/yr ammonia unit and consequently the 620,000t/yr prilled urea unit remains down and preparations for restart are ongo- ing. Demand for urea is seasonally low and no impact on the market has been noted.
France
The French urea market is very much at the tail end of the season with just a few small lots selling for direct applica- tion on corn. The force majeure at Sorfert in Algeria delayed at least one 5,000t cargo and buyers seeking prompt spot volumes this week were forced to pay up to €350/t fca La Pallice.

The focus has shift to the forward market for delivery throughout the second half of the year. Offers have risen to €305-306/t fca La Pallice. Buyers are, however, seeking to buy €300/t fca or just below and are therefore holding off on committing for the time being.
A trader is rumoured to have sold some 10-15,000t of granu- lar urea at $295/t fob, the equivalent of between €297-303/t fca La Pallice.
Belgium
Interest in urea for the Belgium market is extremely low. New season granular urea is offered at around €300/t fca ARA ports for July-January delivery. There is, however, no demand as buyers are still targeting lower prices of around €285-290/t fca that were available earlier in the season.
Spain
There is minimal remaining demand for urea and the focus now is on liquidating existing stocks, prompting a softening of prices. Fertiberia is priced at €315-320/t fca, but prilled urea is also available as low as €310/t fca in some regions.
In the south, Via Fertysem is offering granular urea at around €330/t fca, but prices as low as €320/t fca are also available in parts of the country.
Turkey
An inquiry from Yildez was circulating at presstime for 3,000t of urea.
NF reports to be selling out of stocks in Turkey with the domestic market showing a return of $295/t fob equivalent. Availability is reported to be limited with one cargo ex- Bahrain for Gemlik arriving. However overall traders report limited inquiry at this time.
A trader was offering the remaining 15,000t from a Iranian cargo last week, thought sold to Toros for shipment to Sam- sun. One buyer reported being offered the balance at $320/t cif Iskenderun but declined.
Croatia
Ameropa is loading a 20,000t urea cargo end-June for ship- ment to the US. It is in the freight market for 20,000t urea Sibenik to the Mississippi 20-25 June.

shipments. With no new spot business reported, we maintain that perhaps only 2-3 spot cargoes are available for next month. Fertil is understood to have one vessel.
Iran
It is estimated that around 150-160,000t of Iranian urea is available for the next Indian tender for July shipment.

Africa
Algeria
Nitron is loading 6,000t and 14,000t Algerian granular urea this month, for shipment to France and US respectively. This is thought to be on the Arne and the Franziska Bolten respectively.
Keytrade has nominated the Wilson Sky to load 4,000t.
The AOA plant is reported to be down still - as reported last week the company was going through the commissioning process.
The Sorfert complex is running normally.
Egypt
The urea production situation has improved this week, but remains significantly below full utilisation because of the ongoing natural gas shortages.
Mopco started test runs on its new 650,000t/yr line (Mopco
I)in Damietta on 14 June. The existing 650,000t/yr Mopco
III line, however, remains down because of insufficient gas supply.
Helwan restarted this week and was operating at around 70pc. All of its tonnes are going domestically at present. Alexfert is running at 75-80pc capacity and is also sending
nitrogen this week
all tonnes to the domestic market for the time being. EFC is operating one of its 55,000t/month lines at around 80pc.
The OCI-EBIC line is still down due to gas shortages.
Asia
China
Asking prices have firmed in the run up to the STC tender in India tomorrow, 19 June. Earlier in the week, granular was on offer around $305-310/t fob, but offers have since firmed to $315/t fob. Prills are on offer at $310-315/t fob. A combi- nation of healthy demand anticipated in India and a late do- mestic season are seeing producers take a firm stance. With freight at around $11/t for a panamax, this would equate to offers in India in the mid-$320s/t cfr.
In latest business, Fertisul is loading 4,000t of granular urea to Vietnam on the m/v Hoang Phuong. The business was done late last week.
Fertisul is also loading 10,000t granular urea to Namhae under the last tender on the m/v Hao Fan 6.
As of Thursday, 18 June, port inventories were estimated by some sources at around 560,000t at Chinese ports, including 300,000t at Yantai port. However, trader sources say stocks are considerably lower at 300-400,000t only.
US - barges trade again in wide $305-380/st fob Nola range
Egypt - urea production improves
China - offers for prills and granular firm on Indian tender - domestic sector running well
Brazil - talk for urea around $320-325/t cfr but little spot demand
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
Movements to the ports are also limited basis an average- to-good domestic pull. This will likely continue throughout
1H-July. However operating rates have fallen below 60pc this week.
In the domestic sector, the prilled urea price remained relatively steady this week. The mainstream price for prilled in Shandong province is still around RMB1,750/t ex-works. But the granular urea price dropped. The mainstream price for granular in Shandong province dropped to the same level as prilled.
India
India's STC has issued a urea tender closing on 19 June, with validity requested to 23 June.
The cargoes are to be shipped by 27 July.
STC is expected to target between 600,000-1mn t.
The following urea vessels have arrived or are expected in India:
Kandla - Navdhenu Purna eta 24 June 40,7000t ex-Sur for
IFFCO
Pipavav - Ince Anadolu arrived 18 June 63,000t ex-As- saluyeh for IFFCO
Mangalore - Navdhenu Sun arrived 6 June 42,000t ex-Sur for Kribhco
Karaikal - V Sanderling arrived 13 June 44,000t ex-Sur for
IFFCO
Widespread rainfall witnessed on Sunday 14 June across the country has pushed overall rains received so far in the cur- rent monsoon season to 11pc higher than normal according to press reports and this is expected to boost kharif sowing activities.
Sri Lanka
While not confirmed, Dreymoor has been reported as gaving been awarded 18,000t prilled urea at $345.86/t cfr with 270 days' credit for August delivery. It was also awarded 36,000t granular urea at $347.26/t cfr also with 270 days' credit.
The Ministry of Agriculture has subsequently issued a new tender closing on 29 June for 36,000t of granular urea and 12,000t of prills.
Taiwan
The TFC Taiwan tender, which closed on 15 June, has report- edly been awarded at $315-316/t cfr to a Chinese trading company. The tender called for 6,000t but some believe TFC may buy more. Freight from China to Taiwan is estimated at $16-19/t.
Thailand
Buying ideas are reportedly around $318-320/t cfr but this is not workable currently and trade is thin.
Nepal
AICL closes a tender for 25,000t bagged urea on 24 July.
Korea
Namhae closes a tender on Friday 20 June for 6,000t prills for 10-15 July delivery to Kwangyang.
Vietnam
Vietnam imported 38,984t of urea in May. This brings year- to-date imports to 54,615t, up significantly on the 35,000t imported in the same period of 2014.
New Zealand
Ballance New Zealand held a snap tender on 17 June for 27,500t of granular urea for 2H-July shipment. An award has yet to be confirmed although there are reports of an award to a trader with possible backing ex-Fudao around $308- 309/t fob. This remains unconfirmed.

US
US urea barges traded again in a wide range, with rice demand and short-covering pushing prompt/loaded prices higher, while July values showed signs of weakness. The Nola urea assessment moved to $305-380/st fob Nola, with loaded barge prices representing the high end. The low end is set based on late-week offers for first-half July loading that were met with minimum buying interest. July bids were scarce this week as traders retreated to assess a growing number of imports (totaling at least 260,000t) next month, many of which will arrive after peak demand.
The high end of the Nola urea assessment reached its high- est point since 17 July 2014.
CF Industries will expand the urea-based product capacity at its Courtright nitrogen fertilizer complex in Sarnia, Ontario, by 130,000 st/yr with an $85mn debottlenecking project.
Debottleneck work at Courtright's existing urea plant will begin in 2015 and is expected to be done in the fourth quar- ter of 2017, concurrent with a planned turnaround. Cour- tright has an existing average urea capacity of 160,000 st/yr.
The expansion will increase CF's ability to produce granu- lar urea, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and urea liquor at the plant. Courtright has an average gross ammonia capacity of 500,000 st/yr and UAN capacity of 345,000 st/yr.
The Courtright expansion follows major projects at CF's nitrogen plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, which are on track to be completed in 2016. Com- bined, those two expansions will add an estimated 2.1mn st/ yr gross ammonia, 2mn-2.7mn st/yr of granular urea and up to 1.8mn st/yr of UAN, depending on product mix, according to CF's annual report.
Brazil
Tonnage is mostly moving on formula hence spot activity is limited. Granular urea is being offered in a $320-325/t cfr range but bids are reportedly lower at sub-$320/t cfr basis some trader length still evident. Prills are reported at $15/t discount.
Brazilian fertilizer sales dropped by 21.4pc to 2.07mn t in May from a year earlier, Brazil's fertilizer industry associa- tion Anda said.
In the first five months of 2015, fertilizer consumption fell by 12pc to 9.04mn t compared with the same period of 2014.
Domestic fertilizer production declined by 4.9pc in May to 708,216 t from a year earlier, but rose by 5.5pc in the first five months of the year to 3.62mn t compared to the same period of 2014.
Fertilizer imports declined by 5.5pc in May to 1.79mn t and fell by 18.4pc to 7.26mn t in the first five months of the year.
The trends reflect a weakening Brazilian currency versus the US dollar, as well as a decline in investments in crop inputs as farmers seek to trim costs amid rising interest rates and tighter margins.
Domestic consumption of nitrogen-based fertilizers de- creased by 5.3pc to 1.33mn t in the first five months of 2015, reflecting weaker demand from cotton, wheat, sugar cane and second-crop corn cultivation, according to Anda.
Domestic production of nitrogen-based fertilizers increased by 18.1pc while imports were down by 6.8pc in the five- month period.
Brazil's largest grain-producing state Mato Grosso accounted for the highest share of fertilizer consumption in the first five months of 2015, at 1.73mn t, followed by Parana state with 1.36mn t and Sao Paulo state with 1.14mn t.
Brazil recently began harvesting its second-crop corn. The country's crop supply company Conab estimates that the 2014/15 second-crop corn harvest will reach 49.4mn t, a 2pc increase from the 2013/14 crop. Overall grain output is seen reaching 204.5mn t this season, up by 5.6pc.
Local agricultural consultancy Agroconsult is projecting that the recent hike in interest rates for the farm sector could decrease soy-planted areas in the upcoming 2015/16 crop season.
As a result, Brazilian fertilizers sales are expected to decline this year for the first time since 2009, according to market estimates. The bulk of the decline will come from imports, with domestic production increasing.
Chile
After the recent spate of sales, the market is taking a breather. Traders say demand is covered until 2H July.

Uruguay
Demand for urea is covered until end-July and interest in minimal.
Ammonium Sulphate/Nitrate
Brazil
Offers of AN have risen from around $230/t cfr reported last week to $235-245/t cfr basis tight supply and the general firm sentiment in the urea market.
Capro grade amsul has reportedly traded at $175/t cfr and offers are at $185/t cfr for July tonnage. Chinese material is on offer from traders at around $170/t cfr. One trader re- ports a sale at $167/t cfr netting the mid-$130s/t fob China.
Netherlands
Dutch buyers have accepted the €225/t cif inland list price for June and July sales at €230/t cif inland have also taken place. Good levels of demand were seen so far in June although lack of rain has stopped applications for the time being.
OCI has also announced a further €5/t price increase for August deliveries and the producer reports good uptake for June-August. Other producers are expected to follow suit with similar levels.
Ukrainian CAN continues to be offered out of Ghent at be- tween €210-215/t fca. Buyers will only look to purchase for direct application because of concerns over quality deterio- ration if it is stored until next spring.
Turkey
Small trades of steel grade amsul are heard done in the low/ mid-$120s/t fob Black Sea.
China
Capro grade amsul is on offer in the low/mid-$130s/t fob China basis limited supply.
Steel grade amsul has reportedly seen a slight weakening of $2-3/t on a small trade between a producer and a local trader of around 3,000t in the mid-$120s/t fob.
Indonesia
Indonesia's Petrokimia Gresik has issued a tender closing 22 June for 10,000-15,000t capro-grade amsul for 1H August arrival.
Vietnam
Vietnam imported 102,534t of amsul in May, bringing year- to-date imports to 434,256t, almost exactly in line with imports in the same period of 2014.
Germany
The €225/t cif inland list offer level for June deliveries of CAN 27 recently announced by leading suppliers has been accepted and July sales at €230/t cif inland have also taken place.
Some imported CAN is coming into southern Germany and also northern ports priced equivalent to €220-222/t cif inland. But these quantities are limited and so have not dis- rupted sales of the traditional suppliers at list levels.
France
After a strong start to the season, AN sellers, led by Yara have raised prices by around €7/t for next deliveries. Distrib- utors and farmers have accepted these prices which remain competitive when compared to year ago levels.
Yara raised its AN 33.5 price to €292/t cpt bulk on 10 June, up from its new season start price of €285/t cpt bulk, with immediate effect. This relatively large, €7/t hike, suggests that uptake from distributors has been strong. Both Borealis and EuroChem are understood to be offering AN at simi- lar levels for July. Distributors fully expect further price increases in August and say that while demand from cereal farmers is strong the same cannot be said for grassland.
Offers of imported product from Lithuania and Poland have diminished as sellers are targeting more lucrative markets, such as the UK. Lithuanian producer Achema has an extend- ed turnaround at its plants July-September so is sold out. Spot market prices for AN were heard around €3/t firmer at between €272-275/t fca bagged. Georgian AN is on offer in Nante at €275/t fca bagged.

Similarly, there has been good offtake in June in the French CAN 27 market. Buyers have readily accepted Yara’s new CAN July delivery price of €237/t cpt bulk, up from its start price of €230/t cpt bulk. Buying has been strong, especially since Yara’s price was some €2-3/t lower than its competi- tors but the latest increase will change that.
OCI is sold out for June and July priced at €233/t cpt bulk and €238/t cpt bulk, respectively. The producer is also of- fering August delivery at €243/t cpt bulk but buyers are not booking material yet as they have time to wait.
Belgium
Lack of rain has stopped CAN spreading and as a result sales at retail level have come to a halt. Demand in June, the first month of the new fertilizer year, was strong and most local suppliers are sold out. The bulk of the application season
is over in Benelux but buyers will continue to purchase for grassland applications which will finish in early August.
Buyers have fully accepted the €225/t cif inland level for June and July sales at €230/t have also taken place.
OCI also announced €235/t cif inland for August and reports good uptake at its offer to sell the quantities required for June-August, at an average price across the three months.
Another 27,000t cargo of Ukrainian CAN is reported to have arrived in Ghent. This brings the total up to around 100,000t. An estimated 40-50,000t of CAN is in stock in Ghent selling at €210-215/t fca. Concerns with quality dete- rioration mean that distributors will not buy Ukrainian CAN to store.
Some 20-30,000t of Spanish/Fertiberia CAN is understood to have arrived in Ghent, Moerdijk and Brake over the past week or so. The cargoes are mostly sold at around €210- 215/t fca.
UAN Solutions
US
The US UAN market was inactive this week with the last of side dress applications cut short by wet weather across the Corn Belt.
Preliminary summer fill offers remain in the range of $210-
215/st fob Nola, and a major US producer is expected to announce its price level shortly.
The last East Coast import business for summer arrival con- cluded at $235/t cfr. Offers have risen marginally higher, but potential buyers are resisting the increase so far.
Belarus
It is understood that the latest Grodno sales tender which closed this week for 25,000t UAN, was a retender from 12 June. It is reported to have been awarded at around €170/t fob (the low-$190s/t fob) with tonnes destined for France and the Ukraine.
France
Demand for prompt UAN is over and the focus is firmly on the forward market. Argus FMB estimates that between 30- 40% of the French UAN solutions market, which totals some 2.4 million t, has been covered so far.
UAN offer prices have pulled back from the latest sales done at around €198/t fca Rouen late last week to €196-197/t fca Rouen for second half 2015 delivery. Helm is indicating €200/t fca for forward delivery but buyers are not currently interested at this level.
Sellers expect UAN market prices to firm in France based on tighter supply during the summer. Lithuanian supplier Achema will produce at 50pc of capacity because of a turnaround at one of its ammonia units. While Romania’s Interagro plants look set to remain closed into July because of a gas dispute with the government. Furthermore, supply from Abu Qir in Egypt remains unreliable, although it issued a tender this week closing 23 June for 10,000t for end-June shipment.

Belarussian producer Grodno Azot retendered on 15 June for 25,000t UAN and it was reported to have been awarded at around €171-172/t fob (the low-$190s/t fob) with some 15,000t destined for France and the balance for Ukraine. Offer prices in Rouen are estimated to be in the high €190s/t fca, in line with current market prices.
The first 41,000t of possibly four UAN 32 cargoes sold by CF industries arrived into La Pallice/Rouen on the m/t Yangon this week. Market sources expect co-ops to buy similar quan- tities compared to last year when CF Industries exported close to 200,000t of UAN from Donaldsonville throughout the summer months.
Germany
Germany's SKW Piesteritz has announced a new UAN 28 offer price of €182/t cif inland equivalent for July deliveries. SKW Piesteritz had previously sold new season UAN 28 at €175/t cif inland but then withdrew this price.
Egypt
Abu Qir has issued a sales tender closing 23 June, for 10,000t UAN for end-June shipment.
News
Togliatti to build 3rd urea unit
TogliattiAzot intends to build a third urea unit with de- velopment of project documentation slated for 2015. The company plans to launch a new urea production and build a prilling tower with capacity of 2,200 t/day with commission- ing planned for 2017. Currently, the company is working on the reconstruction of the existing urea production with the possibility of increasing the capacity of up to 1,500t/day. Investment in the project was not disclosed.
