ANALYSIS
UAN prices continue to slide as buyers wait for floor
UAN
UAN prices continued to fall with except in Germany where there were no trades reported. Abu Qir's tender next week will provide and indication on the extent of discounts required for buyers to re-enter with the intent of shipping to Europe.
Some producers are all still contemplating UAN production cuts to rather than selling at break-even at best, or at a loss.
Abu Qir is looking to improve on the $140/mt FOB price achieved in its January 26 tender, but this appears unlikely at present. Dependent on the outcome in its February 8 tender the producer will limit or altogether stop production of UAN.
Bunge bought 25,000 mt of UAN from Nitron for Argentina, likely to be loaded from CF production out of the US.
Achema's 1.36 million mt/year UAN plants are still at limited output due to a technical issue in one of its ammonia lines since January 2016. The units are expected to start production in February, with availablity ample in March.
GrodnoAzot remains quiet on UAN, and is reported to be continuing to place output in the domestic market, claiming returns well above those currently available in the export market.
US activity is seasonaly modest, but barge offers have not declined in the last couple of weeks, while inland resale values also are relatively steady. Next week's TFI annual business meeting and the March US planting forecast likely will provide key guidance for UAN prices going forward.
Terminals at Rouen and Germany are well covered with very little capacity to take on more UAN in the short term. Prices have declined to €150-155/mt FCA in France with Germany reporting no recent business.
China will be quiet during the lunar New Year holiday period, but producers are continuing to limit production on poor netbacks. Even so there will be some quantities available to load at the end of February. The Chinese price is assessed at $145-150/mt FOB.
Ammonium Sulphate
Any hope for an big increase in demand for AS has now dissipated due to upcoming holidays in China and an end to buying for the Safrinha crop in Brazil.
Chinese producers are in little hurry to sell before Chinese New Year celebrations with caprolactam grade product now reported available at an even $100/mt FOB.
Offers for caprolactam grade AS from China into Brazil meanwhile are widely available at $130/mt CFR, although there is little business done as buying for the Safrinha crop continues to wind down.
Turkish buyers have shown some interest in securing product with KemerovoAzot linked to the sale of 6- 8,000 mt caprolactam grade AS into Turkey, possibly to Gemlik. Reports at press time suggest business was concluded at $130/mt FOB equivalent, although other market sources contend this level is too high.
Finland’s Norilsk Nickel is reportedly in the freight market for 6-8,000 mt steel grade AS to load for prompt shipment from Pori to Samsun for Toros.
Ammonium Nitrate/CAN
AN prices remain soft for yet another week, despite the increases in urea values registered in main markets such as Brazil and Turkey. The undertone in urea is also relatively firm for forward positions, but AN will remain overpriced in the short term as FSU producers try to maintain netbacks close to $190/mt FOB for AN while quoting urea a mere $10/mt higher.
Demand is subdued with the exception of some small quantities for North Africa. Turkish and Brazilian buyers appear content to stay sidelined until and unless prices match urea values more closely, with premiums for the nitrates within historical levels.
Buyers also point to the depressed market for UAN where sales from Egypt were made last week at $140/mt FOB. That number reflected urea values around $200/mt FOB on a pure nutrient basis, while Egyptian urea traded at the time at $224/mt FOB.
Prices for CAN in NW Europe remain under pressure on limited demand while supply is set to increase substantially in about two weeks when OCI is due to restart its Geleen plant.
MARKETS
UAN
NORTH AMERICA
US Midwest: Modest shift in UAN quotes
US UAN indications arguably are up marginally this week. However, the difference from earlier reports is very modest and reflects higher costs from some inland terminals rather than improved enduser support. The current Midwest price spread is $6.94-7.00/unit FOB.
US NOLA: UAN quotes holding firm
More and more traders are confirming that despite lower bids and offers in the paper markets, prompt UAN- 32 barges are not available below $160/st FOB New Orleans.
Much of the more bearish talk in the marketplace has been fueled by the rumor that CF is supporting a cargo sale through a trader to Argentina that would net no better than $130-140/mt FOB US Gulf. However, domestic physical offers and barge offers from UAN importers have not reached near these levels.
US Atlantic Coast: Import competition drives UAN lower
UAN truck prices along the US East Coast have fallen as low as $5.31/unit FOB in the Chesapeake region. Prices are still posted up to $5.94/unit FOB from terminals further south.
The driver for the current decline appears to be the willingness of sellers of UAN from EuroChem, Acron and possibly other suppliers to compete hard for business in order to clear tank space for further imports. Postings along the Atlantic seaboard were over $6.72/unit FOB in prior weeks.
As a result of this competition, indications for spot UAN Cargos to the US East Coast have declined $5/mt from the prior week to $170-175/mt CFR. Some importers argue they can buy below this level but no completed business has been confimed in the $160s/mt CFR so far.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Argentina: Bunge will be supplied by Nitron
Reports from other participants in the session suggest that Nitron booked the recent Bunge requirement for 25,000 mt of UAN-32 for Argentina at $171/mt CFR.
The origin of the cargo was not revealed, but indications from the freight-market are that the parcel may load from the US.
Bunge's prior purchase for Argentina was booked October 22 with EuroChem around the $220/mt CFR marker.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: November exports continue to head for the US
Russia exported 103,216 mt UAN-32 in November 2015, up 12% on the same period last year, according to GTIS data.
Russian exports to the US in November fell 4% to 87,894 mt, but still comprise 85% of Russian exports to the US. Ukraine was the second largest receiver of UAN from Russia in November 2015 at 15,024 mt, up from zero the previous year.
Russia was the largest global exporter of UAN in the January-November 2015 period, followed by Lithuania. Total Russian exports for the first 11 months of this year were 1.56 million mt, a 6% decline year-on-year. Again most of its UAN volumes were directed to the US (88% market share).
EUROPE
Germany: No deals reported, pipeline and tanks are full
There has been no reported activity in the German UAN market in recent weeks as storage tanks and the pipeline are full. As such an assessement of no recent business has been applied to the €173-176/mt FCA range.
Rouen: Prices plunge to €150-155/mt FCA
French UAN-30 prices fell sharply this week to €150-155/mt FCA for March/April positions.
The French UAN market remains 90% covered for the season ending April as participants hold off from buying the remainder with a belief that prices have not yet reached their floor.
Price ideas for May/June fell €10/mt to around €145/mt FCA.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Abu Qir issues another UAN tender
Abu Qir issued a new export tender for 25,000 mt UAN closing February 8 for loading from Damietta February 11-15 dates.
The producer is targeting a price of $140/mt FOB in this session following its 5,000 mt sale to Trammo at this level in its January 26 tender. Should the producer fail to sell its 25,000 mt, it may elect to cut UAN production.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Markets to remain quiet for the next fortnight
Upcoming Chinese New Year holidays are expected to create a lull in the UAN market until the end of February.
According to reports, Chinese UAN producers Jinkai and Huaihua will recommence limited production after the holidays to build up inventories until 40-50,000 mt of UAN is available for spot sale.
Producers suggest they will target $150/mt FOB in future sales but buyers contest they are looking for product priced nearer $145/mt FOB.
AS
NORTH AMERICA
US S. Plains: AS values hold after prior plunge
After the sharp decline in ammonium sulphate postings in the south at the end of January, distributors have held steady at $220-230/st FOB in the last couple of weeks. Seasonal demand will not emerge for another few weeks, and peak AS use in the south usually coincides with the first urea application on the rice crop, when the two products are blended.
Mexico: Jump in AS imports from Belgium
Mexican AS imports for November 2015 were just 23 mt, a decrease of 100% on the same period in 2014.
Total imports for the January-November 2015 period registered 213,982 mt, down 20% year-on-year.
Mexican imports from Belgium for the first 11 months of this year grew significantly reaching 144,069 mt, up on the mere 17,000 mt recorded for 2014.
Off-take from Belarus was 16,886 mt, up 62%.
Due to Mexican sanctions on AS originating from China and US, imports from these countries have slumped. Off-take from China reached just 6,500 mt for January-November 2015, a 96% decline on the prior year, while imports from the US were just 416 mt, down 99% year-on-year.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Little interest in AS now
Brazilian demand for AS is slow as buying for the Safrinha crop continues to wind down. Offers for caprolactam grade AS from China are now reported available at the $130/mt CFR level although there is little business done.
Safrinha corn plantings are now over 3% complete in Mato Grosso and Parana. Plantings are expected to be pushed beyond the ideal planting window, which ends February 20, due to unprecedented forward sales and current record high prices. This is expected to help boost nearby farm fertilizer demand, draining some pipeline inventories.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: KemorovoAzot AS sale into Turkey
KemerovoAzot is linked to the sale of 6-8,000 mt caprolactam grade AS into Turkey, possibly to Gemlik. Reports at press time suggest business was concluded at $130/mt FOB equivalent although other market sources contend this level is too high.
Russia: Reduced availability prompts fall in exports
Russia AS exports for November 2015 were 32,189 mt, a 49% decrease on the prior year period.
Total shipments for the January-November 2015 period reached 510,841 mt, a fall of 26% on reduced availability.
Russia exports to Ukraine during the first 11 months of this year were 178,083 mt, up 17% year-on-year.
Shipments to Turkey for the period were 140,977 mt, down 40%.
Exports to Brazil more than halved at 42,422 mt as
China shipped more to the south American country.
EUROPE
Finland: Norilsk Nickel offering 6-8,000 mt AS
Finland’s Norilsk Nickel is reportedly in the freight market for 6-8,000 mt steel grade AS to load for prompt shipment from Pori to Samsun for Toros.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Interest in AS dries up
Interest in Chinese AS has dried up with producers in little hurry to sell before Chinese New Year celebrations. Last known sales for caprolactam grade AS were concluded in the $103-108/mt FOB range in recent weeks but product is now reported available at an even $100/mt FOB.
