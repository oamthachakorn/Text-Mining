MARKET ANALYSIS
Divergence noted in values east and west of Suez
By Jennifer Willis-Jones
Prices west and east of Suez have diverged substantially with significant declines noted across the Middle East, Indian and Far East indexes. Black Sea pricing remains unchanged while pricing for ammonia delivered to Tampa in April was lifted a mere $10/mt last week to $485/mt CFR.
Weekly Market Report
26 March 2015
Current weakness in pricing and demand east of Suez looks to set to continue into April. The Indian H1 phosphoric acid price fixed at $805/mt P2O5 CFR with 30 days credit this week, an increase of $40/mt on the H2 2014 price, means Indian buyers will continue to apply substantial pressure on Middle East producers to reduce prices further in order to make a margin in production and sales of DAP. Buyers in South Korea and Taiwan predict little improvement in downstream demand from acrylonitrile producers in the near term and are trying to reduce inventories accordingly.
Middle East spot values have been revised downwards reflecting Marubeni’s recent 5,000 mt ex-Bangladesh sale to CIL in India at $430/mt CFR. Theoretical netbacks would suggest values of $370/mt FOB Middle East taking into account Fertilizer Week’s Middle East– East Coast India commercial/spot freight assessment around $60/mt. Allowing for an adjustment to reflect the low freight for Marubeni on the proximity of Kakinada to Chittagong, and assuming a time charter rate for a conveyance to Kakinada from the Middle East closer to or below $50/mt, netbacks are however pegged at $380/mt FOB.
Supplier offers for additional cargoes reported at $470/mt CFR in South Korea and Taiwan and CJ Indonesia’s purchase from Mitsui at $465/mt CFR this week also support similar or even lower returns if shipped from the Middle East.
Stability prevails west of Suez where little change in values was noted despite purchases from Koch in Yuzhnny and Ventspils. OPZ’s 40,000 mt sale to Koch was secured within the $400-410/mt FOB range while Baltic netbacks slipped to $410-420/mt FOB as the trader secured a mix of Achema, Uralchem and TogliattiAzot tonnage for April loading on the Clipper Neptun.
Expectations of further price increases in US Gulf ammonia after last week’s April price fixture might conceivably benefit from
events overseas, including the unrest in Yemen. Demand expectations from US phosphate giant Mosaic are flat, while summer purchases will depend in part on how much ammonia is consumed during the US spring planting season.
Inland, ammonia application work is under way in a few parts of the Corn Belt and the pace should pick up substantially in the next two weeks due to cooperative weather. Markets in the south, which consume far less direct application ammonia, have been less fortunate. Rain is reported again in Oklahoma and Arkansas and there is a significant possibility that farmers may turn to urea if they can in coming weeks, should ammonia equipment fail to enter fields due to soggy conditions.
Highlights of the week
Koch secures Black Sea cargo around $400-410/mt FOB Baltic values at $410-420/mt FOB via sale to Koch Bagfas buys 5,000 mt from Trammo at $430-440/mt FOB Middle East values slide to $380/mt FOB via netbacks calculated on CIL India deal at $430/mt CFR
MPC ammonia unit down; Qafco units III, V and VI still shut CJ Indonesia tender awarded at $465/mt CFR to Mitsui Demand in Far East still dire; spot offers in region around $470/mt CFR
Tampa April fixed at $485/mt CFR
Short term outlook
The spread between Middle East and Black Sea pricing looks set to widen in the coming month. Indian and Far Eastern buyers will continue to place downwards pressure on pricing of cargoes emanating from Saudi Arabia and Qatar while optimism in the US for spring ammonia application will likely provide a boost to Black Sea prices.

Ammonia versus DAP
Following on from this week's conclusion of the phosphoric acid price in India, ammonia has become the key driver for the phosphate market there. If ammonia prices are maintained at a level of around $440/mt CFR or assessed even lower, Indian producers will in turn maintain a reasonably steady level of DAP production. This will mean that OCP will be able to switch back to shipping increased volumes of phosphoric acid in Q2 rather than granulating larger quantities as it has done in Q1.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices increased week on week to $1,650-1,700/mt CFR to $1,600-1,650/mt CFR China, continuing the rebound from the downward spiral the underwent from September 2014 to January of this year.
MARKET UPDATES
THE AMERICAS
US MIDWEST
Ammonia starts moving in US Corn Belt
The direct application ammonia work began in southern Indiana and Illinois this week. Ground conditions still are not suitable across most of the Midwest and the Dakotas. Nevertheless, the early start before April 1 suggests not only sufficient time to move spring and carried- over prepaid ammonia but to allow for re-fill business later in the season.
Prices across the Midwest are cited from a low of about $580/st FOB west of the Mississippi River to $615/st FOB farther east. Rail delivered quotes in the Midwest and the Dakotas are $580/st DEL.

Barge indications narrow modestly
Moderate gains in import costs and lower sales values in some up- river markets have squeezed the indicated range for New Orleans ammonia barges to $463-517/st FOB. However, the midpoint between the current spread and prior weeks' indications moved up just $4.50/st as a result of the shift.
US TAMPA
Gulf trade now waiting for overseas reactions to increase
Despite bullish expectations from ammonia suppliers, key US buyers are waiting to see if overseas endusers support continued increases in ammonia costs. If other enduser markets do not move up independently of the April Tampa price tag of $485/mt CFR, Yara and other sellers can expect substantial resistance from fertilizer and industrial buyers in coming weeks to higher indications. The April price moved up $10/mt late last week based on a settlement between Mosaic and yara.

BALTIC SEA
Koch buys up Baltic tonnes
Koch's Clipper Orion is expected to arrive in Ventspils April 4-9 to load a 40,000 mt cargo reportedly secured at $410-420/mt FOB. Up to 12,000 mt is understood to have been sourced from Achema, just 1,000 mt from Ameropa and the balance from Uralchem.
Koch secures cargo from OPZ
OPZ is understood to have agreed the sale of 40,000 mt to Koch for lifting April 15-20 on the Clipper Neptun within the $400-410/mt FOB range. Up to 12,000 mt will be loaded by TogliattiAzot in a return swap after OPZ supplied a similar volume to Koch earlier this month for loading on the Jenny N following Ameropa's 40,000 mt sale.
Trammo's Sylvie is currently loading a mixture of OPZ and TogliattiAzot tonnage for Turkey where a reported 5,000 mt sale to Bagfas provides Black Sea netbacks in the low $400s/mt FOB.
Ameropa will load 23,500 mt on the Cambridge early April for OCP under an existing agreement between the parties.
Trammo's Marycam Swan will return to Yuzhnny in April to load
15,000 mt sourced from TogliattiAzot in another return swap:

Bagfas buys cargo from Trammo
Bagfas is linked to a 5,000 mt purchase from Trammo at $430- 440/mt FOB providing Black Sea netbacks in the low 400s/mt FOB.
Petkim is also reported to have secured 6,000 mt at around the same price.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
SAUDI ARABIA
MPC forced to shut down ammonia facility again
Middle East suppliers are still reported offering cargoes outside contract commitments to Far Eastern customers despite a number of plant shutdowns. Reports that Mitsui may have secured a small spot cargo for lifting on the Gas Oriental in April in conjunction with PIC Kuwait contract tonnes could not be verified at press time.
Sabic's joint venture the Ma'aden Phosphate Company (MPC) shut down its ammonia plant March 24 so that unscheduled maintenance can be carried out on its cooling facility. The ammonia unit only restarted after a 30-day scheduled maintenance February 22.
The company said in a bourse filing that the shutdown at the Ras Al Khair (RAK) facility would last for around 10 days. The plant closure may affect availability of merchant ammonia given that the company said it would continue to produce DAP using existing ammonia stocks.
Muntajat said Qafco's Ammonia III, V and VI plants remain shut down undergoing maintenance until the end of March with low ammonia inventories for April.
Spot values have been adjusted downwards reflecting Marubeni’s recent 5,000 mt ex-Bangladesh sale to CIL in India at $430/mt CFR. Theoretical netbacks would suggest values of $370/mt FOB Middle East taking into account Fertilizer Week’s Middle East –East Coast India commercial/spot freight assessment around $60/mt. Allowing for an adjustment to reflect the low freight for Marubeni on the proximity of Kakinada to Chittagong, and assuming a time charter rate for a conveyance to Kakinada from the Middle East closer to or below $50/mt, netbacks are pegged at $380/mt FOB.
The CJ Indonesia purchase from Mitsui at $465/mt CFR this week would have yielded a similar or even lower return, if shipped from the Middle East.
India prices move lower on CIL purchase
Marubeni sold a 5-6,000 mt spot cargo ex-Bangladesh to CIL at $430/mt CFR this week. The Gaschem Stade will load 10,000 mt in Chittagong March 28-29 under a long term supply contract and discharge half the cargo in Kakinada for CIL early April followed by the delivery of the balance 5,000 mt for SPIC in Tuticorin concluded several weeks ago within the $470-480/mt CFR range.
IFFCO said its 40,000 mt ex-Black Sea cargo off the Clipper Mars finished discharging March 24. The tonnes were reported priced via formula at $470-480/mt CFR.
Raintrade will deliver a 23,000 mt contract volume via CIFC end March/early April to Paradip off the Gas Line. The price of the cargo has not yet been settled.
The impact on ammonia demand following the H1 phosphoric acid price fixed at $805/mt P2O5 CFR with 30 days credit, an increase of $40/mt P2o5 on the H2 2014 price, is as yet unclear. Given current ammonia values as low as $430/mt CFR, DAP output will likely be boosted despite the higher phosphoric acid price.
Should NP/NPK production prove more attractive in the short term, it is likely ammonia imports would be sustained at current levels given that grades such as 20-20-0 require more N than DAP.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
INDONESIA
CJ Indonesia tender awards tender to Mitsui
CJ Indonesia reportedly awarded its March 25 ammonia import tender for 6,000 mt for early May delivery to Mitsui at $465/mt CFR. Offers from Trammo, Yara and Fertcomm were at least $20/mt higher.
AMMONIA | 5
SOUTH KOREA
Values fall on multiple supplier offers
South Korean values edged down to $470-490/mt CFR with a number of supplier offers for additional cargoes for May delivery at the low end of the range.
Namhae has not ruled out the possibility of securing another cargo for May discharge, while SFC said high inventories due to weak downstream demand from acrylonitrile producers was an ongoing issue.
The Taekwang acrylonitrile chemical complex was initially shut down February 25 through mid March but will now not reopen until mid April due to technical issues and poor demand. SFC suggested that when the facility restarts it is unlikely to operate at full capacity.
TAIWAN
CPDC may secure additional cargo for May delivery
CPDC continues to report being approached by Middle Eastern and Asian suppliers keen to gauge interest in a 10,000 mt addtional cargo outside contract commitments for May delivery. The buyer said it needs to determine its contract delivery schedule for May before it makes a decision on any extra ammonia volumes.
Prices are pegged at $470-490/mt CFR although further falls in prices over the coming weeks are not inconceivable given ample supply and ongoing weak demand in the region.
CPDC will receive 23,000 mt contract cargo from Mitsui off the Gas Oriental April 17.
