Fertilizer Shipping Market Report
1st June –5th June 2015
The pacific market this week has picked up due to the climbing number of exports from china including steels, fertilizers and clinker/cement. Nickel ore has been relatively slow with only a few cargos coming into play. The coal biz in SE. ASIA has been more active in comparison to the previous month and more enquiries coming to the market for china and India direction. For trips to china, the hire rate are still at very low levels.
On the other hand, Atlantic market hardly encountered any major changes since last week.
Outlook: =/UP
The slight upward trend is likely to continue, although some of the high reported numbers do not necessarily reflect the true improvement.
PANAMAX
Current trend: =
Another week dominated by ECSA as vessels kept steaming in one direction. Time charter rates were up a tick as there was demand for spot tonnage for early to mid-June dates. In the east rates were rather flat with only a handful of NOPAC and Indo round stems seen in the market.
Period interest remained low as owners appeared unsure about the direction of rates.
.
Outlook: =
Sentiment slowly picking up in the south Atlantic however much of it is being fuelled by ECSA alone, whereas in the East, the outlook has been relatively flat. Likely to continue next week as very little indicating otherwise.
