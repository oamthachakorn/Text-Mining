Market summary
Bangladesh DAP/TSP tender in the limelight
The Bangladesh DAP/TSP tender, which closed 31 May, has taken centre stage this week. Offer prices for the first 400,000t of DAP ranged $479-491/t cfr but there is some un- certainty over what basis the offers were made. Additionally, while most offers appear to be ex-China, it seems clear not all offers have been backed. In the TSP tender, OCP looks likely to be awarded around 75,000t in the low-$400s/t fob with some Lebanese and Bulgarian TSP in the mix. In terms of deals done, OCP reports the sale of 240,000t MAP to Bra- zil at a stable $500/t cfr. In the east, Pakistan has taken a Saudi DAP cargo in the low-$480s/t cfr while Chinese DAP is also understood to have been sold at a similar level. Around 100,000t of DAP ex-China has been sold to India in the high- $470s/$480/t cfr range.
Outlook: stable to firm

Market analysis
More clarity requested on Bangladesh tender
The market is in a post-conference hiatus with both major buyers and sellers comfortable. Prices have not done any- thing and look stable with more upside likely than downside given Brazilian and Indian subcontinental demand coalesc- ing. But upside is limited and most expect the market to peak early in Q3. Producers seem more keen on volume over price currently. The only anomaly is the low-priced US domestic market which has disconnected from global pric- ing, prompting the question of how much the market could import in 2H 2015.
In Latin America, OCP and traders with MAP positions have maintained prices around $500/t cfr, as indicated last week.
The volume placed by OCP – 240,000t for June – is high. With considerable trader length still evident on Chinese and Rus- sian product, the ability to push prices up further is limited. With 2H July availability from China uncertain due to time constraints, producers may be hopeful of pushing up 11-52 prices next month as Brazil faces less supply options. Most consider $510-515/t cfr at most as achievable.
Elsewhere, the Bangladesh DAP tender has been in the spot- light all week following the release of offers which, quite frankly, have left the industry confused in terms of which offers had been backed and on what basis they were made. Unsurprisingly, the bulk of the offers are understood to be offered ex-China but it is pretty clear not all of the offers have backing. Argus FMB understands that the first 120,000t of DAP offers at the lowest price of roughly $480/t cfr were backed by Hubei Dongsheng at $460/t fob. The next round of offers reflect $470/t fob assuming backing is found while some Chinese producers have indicated backing a price around $480/t fob, though it is highly unlikely awards would be made at that latter level given the volume offered below this level.
Regardless, with Chinese DAP offers now firming, it seems clear that some Chinese producers have used this tender to send a signal to India and Bangladesh on their position in the coming months. This strategy is likely to have been adopted with the upcoming rabi import demand in mind. Although a strong line-up for India, decent commitments for Southeast Asia, emerging demand from Pakistan and likely awards from the Bangladesh tender will all have played a role in support- ing this strategy.
Whilst the Chinese will push for higher numbers, the India cfr price will likely be dependent on several other factors in- cluding the current maximum retail price (MRP), movements of the rupee and the strength of the monsoon, none of the recent developments on which are particularly encouraging. For now, the Indians appear to be mostly covered for the kharif season with DAP imports estimated to total around 2.4mn t during April-June. Another 3mn t or so is expected to be imported for the rabi season. India will return strongly in July and has still taken another 100,000t DAP this week at unchanged prices.
Pakistan has also been active, with another Saudi DAP cargo placed into the market for June. Latest NFDC data would ap- pear to support the view that supplies will be pretty thin for end kharif, necessitating additional imports in Q3.

In the west, the market has been relatively calm with prices holding. The key focus in this region is the strength of de- mand in Brazil. It is clear that Brazil still needs to buy but concerns over crop pricing and the Brazilian real could ham- per this demand to an extent. In terms of pricing, suppliers appear to be maintaining current levels around $500/t cfr.
In Turkey, importers are switching to 20-20-0 from DAP as it is a cheaper option while the indefinite outage at GCT will also have likely pushed buyers to turn to alternatives. Up to 50,000t of 20-20-0 has reportedly been sold to various buy- ers in the last couple of weeks and DAP inquiries are few. GCT has restarted some rock mining, but no meaningful DAP supply will hit the market until July at the earliest.
Looking forward, we maintain our view that the market will be stable-to-firm through Q3 supported by continuing buying in Latin America and India. Q4 looks weaker on seasonal fac-

US
Mosaic reports the sale of 38,000t DAP/MAP/MES this week to South America for July shipment at $471-475/t fob Tampa.
Domestic
The US market weakened this week as buyers retreated because of nonexistent prompt barge demand and uncer- tainty over third quarter values. Offers for domestic DAP for prompt/June loading fell from $423/st fob Nola to $418-420/ st as the week progressed, down from last week’s high trade of $427/st fob Nola. Forward physical prices showed further weakness with August-loading domestic DAP offered at $418/ st fob Nola and September trading at $416/st fob.
With the US undervalued compared to other global markets, it is unlikely to attract a score of imports like last third quar- ter. But general expectation is for at least Moroccan DAP/ MAP imports to factor in the fall season, while the firm total remains undetermined.

Central and Latin America

There is little buyer interest reported as most are now cov- ered for the impending wheat season. Moreover, domestic DAP/MAP demand is weak due to poor wheat prices while reports of domestic DAP/MAP prices providing an equivalent import price of $470-485/t cfr are also discouraging import- ers from purchasing at current levels in the low-$500s/t cfr.
Latest GTIS data shows that Argentinean MAP deliveries in April were up by 55pc year-on-year to 34,377t, of which 17,417t was sourced from Saudi Arabia while 16,900t came from China.
MAP imports during January-April also increased, by 20pc, to 95,519t from the 79,887t recorded in the corresponding period of 2014. China was the primary source during this period shipping 53,648t to Argentina, thanks largely to the introduction of a year-round flat export tax rate. Saudi Ara- bian MAP accounted for 24,317t, 11,548t originated in the US and 5,843t came from Russia.
DAP imports in April rose by 87pc year-on-year to 10,822t, the bulk of which was supplied from Saudi Arabia (10,776t).
DAP imports during the first four months of 2015, however, decreased by 27pc to 43,724t compared with 60,191t in the corresponding period of the previous year. Again, the majority of the deliveries were sourced from Saudi Arabia (36,799t) while 6,825t originated in the US.

Brazil
MAP 11-52-0 is offered at $500/t cfr for discharge at Para- nagua and Rio Grande. Up to six unsold handysized vessels of MAP 11-52-0 ex-FSU and Chinese MAP 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 are uncommitted for late June to early July delivery. Suppli- ers are hopeful that once import activity begins, these will quickly be committed.
Ameropa has yet to sell the balance of 8,000t off its vessel, which is on the water, carrying a total of 30,000t of Austra- lian MAP for arrival at Paranagua in late June. It is targeting $500/t cfr Paranagua and is reported to have achieved close to this level.
OCP is indicating sales of MAP 11-52-0 totalling 240,000t of MAP 11-52-0 for June shipment to various importers, with one cargo for its own system, expected to be placed in a bonded warehouse at Paranagua. OCP indicates the sales were concluded at $500/t cfr Paranagua.
Koch is placing 22,000t MAP from its May PhosAgro vessel into a bonded warehouse. The vessel arrived 31 May but will not berth until 25 June. Reports indicate a very small lot was sold off this vessel to Utilfertil at around $500/t cfr.
Part-cargoes of MAP 11-44-0 have traded this week in the very high-$390s/t cfr Paranagua. Trammo and Mekatrade are linked as the suppliers. A cargo of 10,000t of Chinese MAP 11-44-0 for June loading has reportedly traded at $400/t cfr Porto Alegre, equating to around $390/t cfr Paranagua. Unifertil is linked as the importer but the purchase could not be confirmed with the buyer.
A total of 90,000t of Moroccan TSP to be shipped in three- to-four lots in June has been sold to various importers at $400/t cfr Paranagua.
Overall, there was not a great deal of trading activity reported this week after a major international fertilizer con- ference last week and a national public holiday on 4 June. The government announced this week a farm credit package worth R$188bn ($60.4bn) for 2015/2016, 20pc higher than the previous program, effective from 1 July, to fund farm investments and to finance costs of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers. Farmers have begun making enquiries and next round of inland buying appears to be imminent. Expectation is that importers will finally return to the international mar- ket once inland fertilizer purchasing begins in earnest.
Mexico
Fertinal will ship 35,000-40,000t of DAP/MAP/TSP to Chile in the first half of June. Also for June, it has allocated a parcel to a trader with optional destinations including Bra- zil, Argentina and the US while some phosphates will also be shipped to Central America with the balance going to Mexico.
Mexican DAP exports in March totalled 16,378t compared with 18,451t in March 2014, according to latest GTIS statis- tics. Of this total, 8,900t went to Ecuador while 6,700t was shipped to Australia.
On MAP, exports totalled 28,435t in March compared with 64,425t in the same month of the previous year. The major- ity of the shipments went to Australia (27,200t). Smaller volumes were shipped to the US, Central America and Latin America.

EuroChem has sold 10,000-15,000t of Lifosa DAP to eastern Europe at $500/t fob for June shipment. It has allocated a further 20,000-25,000t of Lifosa DAP to Europe, targeting the same price.
Its remaining Lifosa DAP availability for June, around 35,000- 40,000t, is being offered at $490-500/t fob depending on the destination. For Turkey, EuroChem is targeting $490/t fob but for all other destinations it is targeting $500/t fob.
EuroChem is sold out on MAP for June when it will ship 30,000t to Brazil, 2 x 5,000t to Europe and 35,000t to the local market.
DAP in April from its Kingisepp facility. This was all shipped out of Sillamae. PhosAgro shipped 20,000t DAP to India from Cherepovets and 3,000t to Germany.
On MAP, EuroChem's Belorechensk facility exported 11,000t to Italy from Tuapse and 42,000t from Kingisepp out of Sil- lamae. PhosAgro's Balakovo plant exported 4,000t to Europe out of Ust Luga while UralChem exported 6,000t of MAP including 2,000t to Hungary and 3,500t to Lithuania.
Italy
The DAP season is now finished with next application during autumn. The latest sales were around €495/t fca bulk for use as a raw material. This is equivalent to approximately €510/t fca bagged.
Spain
Turnaround at EuroChem’s Kingisepp and Lifosa DAP is un- derstood to have completed after maintenance was under- taken through the second half of May.
It is also understood that EuroChem will switch partially to NP/NPK production in June for July shipment.
PhosAgro still has one DAP/MAP cargo available for end-June loading and is being offered at $490/t fob.
Customs data shows that EuroChem exported around 25,000t

Fertiberia continues to offer DAP at $550-555/t fca Huelva but there is no demand at this level. Some traditional importers are holding off buying in advance for the autumn season this year, which an early sign that consumption will remain low.
Fertiberia’s 15-15-15 pre-season list price is €375/t delivered and it reports some early trade. Via Fertysem is pricing in line with this in the south amid limited demand.

Saudi Arabia
Ma'aden reports the sale of 25,000t of DAP to Pakistan at a netback price in mid/high-$470s/t fob for June loading.
Also in June, Ma'aden will ship a 39,000t cargo to India at a netback price in the mid-$470s/t fob and a second 35,000t parcel, also to India. Ma'aden is understood to be still in negotiations for a price for the second cargo.
The marketer has one more cargo available for June, which is being offered in Pakistan for mid/late-June loading at a price equivalent to the $480s/t fob.
Sabic meanwhile has sold a parcel of MAP for July shipment to South Africa. ETG took the cargo in the mid/high-$480s/t fob. Another MAP cargo for this market is currently under discussion.
Morocco
From a production of around 350,000t in June, OCP has sold around 60,000t of MAP and 20,000t DAP to European markets in a $505-515/t fob range. MAP destinations include Poland, Spain and Romania. There will not be any shipments under the new deal in Turkey until July.
For Brazil, OCP reports the sale of a total of 240,000t MAP, including one cargo for its own system. The sales have all been concluded around $500/t cfr, netting the mid/high- $480s/t fob Jorf.
There will be around 30,000t DAP for the domestic market and 35,000-40,000t mainly 12-24-12 for west coast Africa. A cargo of 15-15-15 is under discussion for the west coast.
Tunisia
Extraction at two out of GCT's four phosphate rock sites has restarted this week and transfer of rock to Gabes has resumed.
GCT's finished fertilizer plants, however, are still down as the producer needs to build up rock inventory before the plants restart, expected end-June.
Following reports of an 18,000-20,000t DAP shipment to Turkey in recent weeks, there is a freight inquiry for 17,000- 19,000t of DAP from Gabes to Samsun, Turkey for loading 28 May-7 June.
There is also a freight inquiry for 18,000t DAP from Gabes to Constantza, Romania for loading 27 May-6 June.
Given that GCT’s finished fertilizer plants are still out of ac- tion, it is thought that the above inquiries would be fulfilled from stocks.
South Africa
ETG is lifting a July MAP cargo from Sabic, purchased around $485/t fob. Discussions are ongoing for an August Saudi loader. OCP is also reported to be discussing a July MAP loader. There is thought to be demand for at least one more MAP cargo, possibly more for June-July shipment.
Jordan
JPMC is still reportedly running at around 50pc capacity. It is understood to be sold out for June and is now discussing July shipments.
Indian subcontinent
India
Coromandel is in the market for 35,000t of DAP and is tar- geting $470/t cfr with 180 days' credit. At presstime there were reports of offers in the mid-$470s/t cfr.
However most business this week has been reported in the high-$470s/t cfr to $480/t cfr. In this week's business, Wengfu reports the sale of 50,000t DAP to an Indian buyer at $480/t cfr. Meanwhile it is reported that Liven sold 50,000t DAP to IPL in the high-$470s/t cfr. The Kavo Alkyon has been nominated with an eta of 22 June at Mundra.
Kailin will ship two DAP vessels to India in June. The Coris is booked with 60,000t for Zuari while 40,000t will load on another vessel for Chambal.
Ma'aden intends to ship a second DAP cargo to India under contract in June. No price is understood to have been fixed yet for this cargo.
Projected arrivals for June are now around 850,000t bringing April-June arrivals to 2.4mn t. While this demonstrates In- dia’s early season need to replenish low stocks, it also means supplies are plentiful in the market. The overall outlook is still broadly positive for Indian demand to absorb another 3mn t of imported DAP in 2015, but there are some clouds on the horizon.

Firstly the Rupee has again depreciated to around Rs 64.2/$1. This both makes imports potentially more expen- sive and puts pressure on sellers to raise the MRP above the Rs 24,000/t threshold. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is hard to achieve currently, given ample supply and a late start to the kharif season. There is concern about how where the MRP settles. With the Rupee volatile importers are taking a short-term approach to buying. Some reports indicate demand for August is currently pretty thin.
In reality the lack of an official notification on the DAP subsidy is likely a technicality and importing will continue once the DoF makes announcement. Sources in India hint at delays to announcement being on account of some states ex- pressing concern over availability constraints in view of the proposed freight reimbursement to industry/importers.
Contradictory messages are being sent as regards the performance of the monsoon and the likely impact of any El Nino effect. At this stage it is still too early to tell. The traditional landfall of the monsoon over Kerala has been delayed and is now forecast to hit the region later this week according to the Indian Meteorological Department. Overall, total rainfall is now forecast to be "deficient", that is 88pc of normal according to a government statement. However, this only applies to total rainfall, and regional impacts are still hard to gauge.
Pakistan
Ma'aden has sold 25,000t of DAP in the mid-$480s/t cfr for June loading. The buyer is understood to be PakArab. It has now raised its offers to the $490s/t cfr for a mid/late-June cargo.
Reports of a second Saudi DAP cargo sold this week have yet to be confirmed.
It is widely reported that Quantum has sold a 35,000-40,000t cargo of Chinese DAP to Chawla for early June loading - this had variously previously been reported as being of Australian origin but never confirmed - also in the low-$480s/t cfr.
DAP offtake rose in April at the start of the kharif season to 68,000t, a rise of nearly 53pc year on year. Production exactly matched offtake at the Fauji plant with 68,000t reported. Imports hit 38,000t. With an opening stock of 139,000t, total availability was 544,000t. NFDC estimates total demand at 618,000t which indicates some shortfall in supply of 74,000t to be met with imports. However, the NFDC data shows no imports for May onwards and does not
Issue 15-22 | Thursday 4 June 2015
take account of various purchases made in May and early June which would eradicate the shortfall. Even so, supply is forecast to be thin for the onset of rabi and significant purchasing will begin again in July to build stocks.
Bangladesh
The Bangladesh government tender for 400,000t DAP for Q3 supply which closed on 31 May attracted 53 offers from local importers for a total volume of 1.556mn t.
Prices (on a cfr plus bags, bagging and l/c charges basis) for all offers ranged $479-534.14/t. Prices for the first 400,000t ranged $479-491/t.
Hubei Dongsheng backed the first three importers at $479- 481/t cfr. This price does not include local bagging, bags and other associated costs which local sources say would add another $10-11/t. The netback to China is understood to be around $460/t fob.
The next offers 4-12 indicate a price range of $489-489.79/t cfr with Chinese/Australian tonnage indicated. Xianfang is backing local importers at $490.25/t cfr which would take total offers to 400,000t. The tender is understood to be awarded in price ascending order until the total volume is secured. Trader sources say an award is expected on Sunday 7 June.
Most other offers were backed by Chinese producers. The Ma'aden offer was understood to reflect a price in the low/ mid-$470s/t fob.

Phosphoric acid shipments during May -June 2015
East Asia and Oceania
China
All eyes this week were on Chinese offers into the Bangla- desh tender for 400,000t DAP. There was considerable con- fusion as to where offers were, and on what basis they were made. Argus FMB understands that the first 120,000t of DAP offers at the lowest roughly $480/t cfr price were backed by Hubei Dongsheng at $460/t fob. These are the lowest offers by $10/t. The next round of offers reflect $470/t fob assuming backing is found. There seems little doubt that the majority of Chinese producers want to send a message to the Indian and Bangladeshi markets, and there is talk this week of offers as high as $480/t fob. In part this is designed for Indian consumption ahead of rabi import demand, but in reality India, given its current MRP, Rupee and monsoon concerns, is unlikely to move off the $480s/t cfr.
In truth, Chinese suppliers are comfortable. The June line up for India is substantial. Add at least 150,000t of DAP likely to ship to Bangladesh plus sales to southeast Asia and it is easy to argue suppliers are not under pressure.
In terms of actual business this week, YUC is understood to have sold a total of 67,000t of DAP to Southeast Asia at
$475-478/t fob for June shipment. Wengfu reports selling 3,000t DAP to Vietnam in the high-$480s/t cfr, reflecting around $470/t fob. It also reports selling 6,000t DAP to Thailand at a similar netback and 50,000t DAP to India in the mid/high-$460s/t fob.
Liven has meanwhile reportedly sold 50,000t Chinese DAP into India in the high-$470s/t cfr reflecting the mid-$460s/t fob China.
YUC has completed maintenance at its plant and is now in the process of ramping up production. During May, the pro- ducer was operating at around 50pc capacity but increase this to 80pc by next week. In June, it will produce DAP as well as 11-52 and 10-50 MAP.
On MAP, there is some 11-44 MAP available for July ship- ment, but concerns continue about going long on product loading July for arrival into Brazil. Traders say product is available in the low-$370s/t fob all the way up to $380/t fob. Most availability is for 2H July shipment. 10-50 prices are reported in a wide range from $410-430/t fob. One trader reports taking a position at $425/t fob for June.

Japan
According to latest GTIS figures, Japanese DAP imports in April fell by 57pc year-on-year to 8,140t. Of this total, 5,140t was sourced from China with the balance originating from Saudi Arabia.
DAP imports during January-April 2015, meanwhile, were up by 13pc year-on-year to 107,369t. The bulk of the deliveries came from China (56,003t), followed by the US (30,015t) and Saudi Arabia (12,250t).
Thailand
Wengfu reports selling 6,000t DAP to Thailand in the mid/ high-$480s/t cfr.
DAP imports in April totalled just 153t versus 17,887t in the same month of the previous year, latest GTIS data shows.
DAP deliveries during the first four months of 2015 were down by 70pc year-on-year to 29,429t, of which 26,896t was sourced from China and 2,521t from Russia.
Indonesia
A buyer is reportedly inquiring for 15,000t of DAP.
TSP
Bangladesh
A total of 27 offers were submitted under the government of Bangladesh's 200,000t TSP tender which closed on 31 May.
The total volume offered amounted to 375,250t with the prices ranging from $455-490.94/t cfr plus bags and bagging and other costs.
The first 200,000t of TSP have been offered in the range of $455-473/t cfr plus bags and bagging and other costs.
The lowest offer was of Fertinal/Mexican origin at $455/t cfr but reports indicate this origin was disqualified as this origin was not the MoA approved list - although the trader involved at press time sources said that no notification of an official disqualification had been received. OCP had been thought likely to be awarded around 96,000t in a $460-466.79/t cfr range but the Moroccan producer has since advised it may receive an award for 75,000t. One cargo of Lebanese was offered at $463/t cfr and another at $473/t cfr totalling 60,000t. The netback is estimated to be in the $405-410/t fob range. A total of 20,000-50,000t will be sourced from Tunisia (Salakta) at $473/t cfr and with Mexican possibly dis-
qualified Agropolychim Bulgaria completes the 200,000t line up at $474.90/t cfr. However, no award has officially been made and this is expected on Sunday 7 June.
Morocco
The netback from the likely awards in the Bangladesh tender are in the low-$400s/t fob allowing for $35-40/t freight and other costs. OCP reports it will likely be awarded around 75,000t, not the 96,000t previously reported. There are also two cargoes of TSP booked for July-September to BADC under the government-to-government agreement. Shipment may not start until July given the 90,000t booked for Brazil at $400/t cfr (netting the mid/high-$380s/t fob) and 12- 15,000t booked for European destinations.

A trader is understood to have sold 10,000t of Mexican TSP to Uruguay at $395-400/t cfr for June shipment.
China
Wengfu reports selling 5,000 TSP to Japan at $390/t fob.
NPK
Turkey
Turkish buyers appear to be favouring 20-20-0 over DAP due to its more attractive pricing while concerns over limited DAP supply following the outage at GCT is also playing a role in the switch.
Atrader has reportedly sold 6,000-10,000t of Greek 20-20-0 to a buyer at a price around $330/t cfr. The same trader is also thought to have sold 10,000t of Russian 20-20-0 to the same buyer. No price has been indicated for the latter sale.
Gubretas has also reportedly taken 25,000t of Greek 20-20-0 while Vertiqual is understood to have sold 6,000t to Turkey. No prices have been disclosed for these sales.
Some importers are inquiring for Chinese 20-20-0 which has been indicated at $315/t fob while Russian 20-20-0 is being indicated at $320/t fob. A cargo of 50,000t Chinese 20-20 is currently on the water under an old sale. Reports of fur- ther vessels under a contract totalling 150,000t have been refuted.

Company News
PhosAgro reports strong Q1 revenues and
EBITDA
PhosAgro has reported first quarter revenues of RUB50,224 mn ($808mn). This represents a 71pc year-on-year rise in rouble terms which has been supported by an improved pric- ing environment along with significant rouble depreciation. In particular, revenues were supported by higher average pricing for DAP/MAP and NPK exports, which were up by more than 96pc and 81pc respectively in rouble terms.
Its sales of phosphate-based products during the quar- ter increased by 7pc year-on-year to RUB42,860mn and by 5pc in volume terms. Specifically, revenue generated from DAP/MAP exports increased by 139pc year-on-year to RUB21,113mn. A further breakdown shows that revenues from MAP exports rose by 62pc year-on-year and those from DAP exports increased by 443pc.
The producer’s earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) also saw a significant increase, up 186pc, from RUB8,587mn to RUB24,590 mn while net profit increased by an impressive 64pc to RUB14,164mn.
Commenting on the outlook, PhosAgro's chairman and CEO Andrey Guryev said: "Looking ahead, I believe supply-de- mand fundamentals will be supportive of DAP prices. We are seeing substantial improvements in India, one of the most important buyers on the spot market. Combined with our continuous cost optimisation efforts, I expect PhosAgro to show strong performance for the rest of 2015.”
Brazil's Cibrafertil to acquire Agriter
Brazilian SSP producer and NPK blender Cibrafertil has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agree- ment with Agro Industrial Sao Luiz (Agriter) to acquire 100pc of Agriter's NPK fertilizer business.
Cibrafertil said it will benefit from Agriter's strategically located NPK plants, which provide easy access to main dis- tribution points in southern and centre-west Brazil. Agriter has five NPK blending facilities, which produced a total of 681,000t of various NPKs in 2014. There are two units in Paranagua in Parana state and one unit in Sao Francisco do Sul in Santa Catarina in the south region.
Agriter also has two blending plants, one located in Sorriso in Mato Grosso state and the other in Cristalina in Goias state in the central-west region.
Cibrafertil, which is owned by Texas-based Omimex Group, operates a plant in Camacari in Bahia state with capacity to produce 300,000 t/yr of SSP fertilizers.
Cibrafertil also produces a range of NPK fertilizers and has its production hubs in Luis Eduardo Magalhaes and Candeias in Bahia state, which is part of the Matopiba frontier agri- business region, which overlaps the northeastern states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui e Bahia.
The acquisition is subject to approval by Brazilian competi- tion regulator Cade.
