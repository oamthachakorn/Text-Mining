Market Summary
Granular urea market turns bearish
The price rally that started in mid-April has finally run out of steam and fob levels for granular urea have turned down this week. Apart from the US, which is operating in a paral- lel universe at present, sales are proving difficult in major markets. Buyers in Brazil appear to be gaining the upper hand after a prolonged stand-off and granular urea prices are weakening in Thailand as well.
Netbacks to the Middle East have eased to $302-310/t fob from these markets and Kaltim this week sold 90,000t to traders at $308/t fob when last week it was seeking over $320/t fob for the same product. Indications for granular urea from China are around $310/t fob, but no one is buying.
The US market has risen again this week, desperate buyers paying the equivalent of $400/t cfr for loaded barges and, more significantly, the equivalent of $340/t cfr for first half July. As a result, the US is pulling spot cargoes away from other markets, notably Brazil, as traders try to profit from the strength of US prices.

Prilled urea prices remain firm in China. Traders have paid
$303-308/t fob for upwards of 100,000t to cover Indian sales. Inventories are low at the main ports, forcing traders to load panamax vessels in two ports, and producers comfortable.
Figures from India this week show that sales rose 845,000t in the April-May while stocks dropped by half, suggesting there is an urgent need to import more urea. Speculation is mounting that the next tender will be announced shortly and is widely appreciated among Chinese producers.
Assuming Chinese prilled urea prices remain above $300/t fob for July, there is limited downside to granular urea in the AG for the month. AG suppliers enjoy a small freight advantage over China in shipments to India and any surplus urea could be sold there at netbacks above $300/t fob.

Black Sea
DniproAzot and OPZ are largely committed for June and are quoting $295-300/t fob for any remaining tonnage. Latest sales in Turkey reflect the low-$290s/t fob Yuzhny but are based on old positions. The 25,000t of prilled urea sold to NF last week at $298/t fob remains the highest-priced deal this month.
There is demand for prilled urea from Morocco, Spain and Italy for July, which should enable Ukrainian suppliers to maintain prices given the limited production in the country.
Salavat held a sales tender on 9 June and sold 5,500t of prilled urea to Avestra Chemicals for shipment via Tuapse.

Eurochem is negotiating prilled urea for July loading in Tua- pse but has not yet agreed any new business. Price ideas are around $295/t fob.
Baltic
Uralchem sold 20,000t of prilled urea to Mexico on 10 June at a price netting to the high-$280s/t fob Baltic. No other large sales are reported this week. Uralchem has mainte- nance planned at one of its urea plants starting at the end- June/early July, with another plant scheduled to go down at a later, unspecified date.
Trammo has fixed a tbn at $33-34/t to load 35,000t of Phosa- gro prilled urea 13-15 June in Kotka for four ports Peru.
Koch is loading 40,000t of prilled and granular urea in Kotka and Riga at present on a vessel fixed at $23-24/t for dis- charge in Santos and Paranagua, Brazil.
Europe
Turkey
Toros has bought 15,000t of Iranian granular urea from a trader at $316/t cfr with 180 days for prompt shipment. The balance of a 30,000t floating cargo is being offered in southern Turkey.
An industrial buyer has purchased 3,000t of prilled urea from Ameropa at a price netting to $291/t fob Yuzhny.
France
Interest in forward sales remains, but price ideas from major buyers are low – reflecting $280-285/t fob North Africa. The most recent sales took place at $320-325/t cfr equivalent last week, but would be difficult to repeat this week.
Middle East
One new spot sale has been reported this week at $310/t fob

for first half July shipment. The non-US price range has been assessed at $300-310/t fob, based on netbacks from key mar- kets at the lower end of the range.
June tonnage remains in the hands of some traders and still to be sold, with buyers in both Thailand and Brazil proving resistant to the latest offers. Producers are sold out for June and have a large line up of contract shipments for July, with the US prominent. We estimate that 2-3 spot cargoes are available for July, totalling 70-100,000t.
Oman
SIUCI is reported to have sold 30-35,000t of granular urea at $310/t fob for first half July loading. Keytrade is check- ing freight options for 35-40,000t of granular urea to load prompt in Sohar for Brazil, Mississippi River or Thailand.
Fertil
Checks on the jetty used to load urea in Ruwais have been completed and restrictions on vessel size have been relaxed. Fertil is now able to load vessels of 40,000t and above.
Africa
Algeria
Urea production restarted on 6 June at Sorfert's complex at Arzew, according to customers who have been notified by the Algerian company. The urea plant and accompanying ammonia unit had been down since 17 May.
Helm will load 3,000t of granular urea on the m/v Cedeira on 11 May for Spain. The larger quantities sold to other buy- ers will take some time to amass. Indagro has nominated the m/v Servet Ana to load 27,500t for the Americas and Nitron 14,000t on the m/v Franziska Bolten and 6,000t on the m/v Arne, all during June.
Ameropa completed loading 30,000t of granular urea from the AOA plant at the start of this week. The vessel is going to a destination in the Americas. AOA has stopped produc- tion now to make adjustments to the unit as part of the commissioning process and the schedule for loadings during June has not been finalised.
Egypt
OCI will load 25,000t of granular urea in the coming week

for the US. The price has not been confirmed but is believed to be $312-313/t fob.
The inconsistency of domestic urea production shows no signs of abating, despite the recent LNG imports aimed at easing the domestic gas supply shortage.
EFC went down at the start of the week and Mopco remains down. Helwan is also understood to be down, although this

could not be directly confirmed.
Alexfert restarted production at the beginning of the week and is operating at 75-80pc rates (around 41-44,000t/month). Alexfert is delivering all its urea to the domestic market.
Morocco
Buyers are in the market for 8-10,000t of prilled urea for June shipment.
Asia
Traders have sold small lots from old positions at $305/t fob netbacks; while the higher end is quoted for larger quanti- ties. Due to low inventories, traders are having to load panamax cargoes in two ports. Inventories at Chinese ports are estimated at only 400,000t.
Pressure is mounting more on granular urea as supply to the ports is increasing. Suppliers are still asking $310-315/t fob for inventories in ports but no one will pay that today. Gran- ular urea prices appear set to converge with prills in the next 10-15 days, at which point either support may emerge from buyers who can take granular for India, or granular may pull down the prilled urea price.
China
Prices appear to have peaked. Buyers are expecting lower prices because they doubt there is sufficient demand to come from the domestic market to maintain prices for July- August, but producers are content to sit and wait for busi- ness to come to them, unwilling to cut prices for now.
Prilled urea prices are supported by sales for India. Samsung is rumoured to have bought about 100-150,000t to cover sales to India and Pakistan and producers believe there are 160-180,000t of urea still to be covered for India; Agricom, Gavilon and ETA have still to nominate vessels for IPL.
Latest prices for prills are in the range $303-308/t fob.
nitrogen this week
Ameropa is in the freight market for 25,000t of granular urea to load in Basuo for Chile in June. It purchased the cargo from China BlueChem last week at $315-316/t fob. It will also load 35,000t of granular urea in north China in June. China BlueChem has a second half June Fudao cargo to sell but may decide to move the cargo to the domestic market if international prices slip.
India
Vessel nominations under IPL’s 9 May tender have risen to just under 600,000t out of 775,000t awarded. Three sup- pliers – Agricom, Gavilon and ETA – have still to nominate vessels from China.

There is no firm indication when India will tender next for urea, although speculation is already rife that one will be issued shortly. The sales and stocks figures for May shown below do imply that there is an urgent need to import more urea for the kharif season.
Sales rise, stocks fall in May
Preliminary figures for urea sales in India for the month of May show an increase of 304,000t, or 14pc, on May 2014 to 2.472m tonnes.
This follows an increase of 541,000t in April and means that sales are up 845,000t in the first two months of the year.
As a result, stocks are estimated to have fallen to 425,000t at the end of the month, compared to 836,000t at the end of May 2014.
Naphtha supply extended to urea plants
The three naphtha-based ammonia/urea plants in southern India have had supply extended for another three months to enable continued production, the government said this week.
Fertilizer minister Ananth Kumar said on Wednesday: “The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the continuation of production of urea from Madras Fertiliz- ers, Manali, Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers, Mangalore, and Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation, Tutico- rin, using naphtha as feedstock”.
The three plants have a combined capacity to make 1.5m tonnes/year of urea. Naphtha supply is being maintained to prevent a shortage of urea in the south until such time as the plants can be connected to gas supply.

AICL has issued a tender for 25,000t of bagged urea closing on 24 July. Offers should be on a cif Nepal basis for delivery to AICL warehouses and valid for 21 days. Delivery of the urea should be within 90-110 days after l/c opening.
South Korea
Dongbu tendered this week for 4,000t of granular urea and is reported to have bought at Chinese cargo at a price net- ting to $305/t fob.
Under its 4 June tender, Pungnong purchased 5-6,000t of prilled urea from LG International at $313/t cfr, reflecting around $297/t fob China.
Indonesia
Kaltim sold a total of 90,000t granular urea this week through private negotiations at a common price of $308/t fob for June/early-July loading in Bontang. The price is $3-4/t lower than in Kaltim’s previous sale. Sales were as follows:
CHS 30,000t Daewoo 6,000t Koch 40,000t
Samsung 20,000t
CHS and Samsung are expected load vessels for Central America. Koch is rumoured to be shipping 10,000t to Thai- land. Daewoo is covering a sale in Vietnam.
Thailand
Offer prices for granular urea are retreating in the face of indifference from buyers. Prices have fallen by about $5/t to the range $315-320/t cfr this week, with importers seeing the purchases in Indonesia at $308/t fob as evidence of a weakening market. Buyers are bidding at $310/t cfr for the next cargoes.
The 30,000t Iranian granular urea cargo sold to 2-3 buyers at $305/t cfr during May has been cancelled due to payment problems and the cargo sold in Turkey/southern Europe instead.
Vietnam
Daewoo is reported to have sold 6,000t of Indonesian granu- lar urea for June shipment.
Americas
US
Rice and corn top-dress application demand fuelled a rally in US urea prices this week. Barges have traded at the equiva- lent of $335-342/t cfr for first half July and the US is pulling in spot vessels, particularly those originally intended for Brazil. New vessels for the US include:
Ameropa/Kuwait 35,000t diverted from Brazil
Koch/Oman 35,000t June vessel declared for the US
OCI/Egypt 25,000t loading week commencing 15 June
Indagro/Algeria 27,500t confirmed for second half June
The strength of US prices and liquidity in Nola mean that there will be a large line up of vessels to load in July also.
July prices are eclipsed by those for prompt/loaded barges, however, which have traded as high as $370/st fob Nola, up by $15/st from the high end of last week’s assessment. Barges for loading in first-half July traded at $309-315/st fob Nola, compared to trades for that loading window at $305/ st last week. Prices for June-loading barges surged from an early-week low of $329/st fob Nola to $355/st fob.
The high end of this week’s $309-370/st fob Nola range represents the highest mark for the assessment since August 2014 and marks a $94/st rise over the last two months. The
US vessel arrivals of granular urea 2014-15
wide assessment range is due to the sharp drop in forward values. But rice demand is expected to keep prompt values supported at least through June, particularly with delays along the Arkansas River crimping stocks in that key distribu- tion hub.
Mexico
The buying group held a tender on 10 June for 20,000t of prilled urea and 5,000t of SAN for first half July shipment to the east coast. Uralchem took the award. Prices are reported in the high-$280s/t fob for the prilled urea and

$235-240/t fob for the SAN.
Brazil
Sales of granular urea are taking place under price formulas but there is a lack of fixed price business with which to as- sess the market.
Firm offers for June granular urea from the Middle East were in the $330-335/t cfr range earlier in the week for deliveries at Paranagua, Sao Francisco or Rio Grande against bids at $320/t cfr Paranagua and $325/t cfr Itaqui.
By midweek offers were adjusted down to $325/t cfr Rio Grande but yielded no new business. Bids were in the range $310-315/t cfr.
There is an overall perception among buyers that prices for granular urea will fall below the $310/t cfr mark in the sec- ond half of June, as more tonnes become available. Traders are doing their best to avoid overloading the market.
Ameropa has diverted a 40,000t Kuwaiti granular urea vessel to the US due to slow market conditions in Brazil. The cargo loaded in Kuwait in May and is floating. It is now reported that only three Qatari cargoes will load for Brazil in June rather than five. Traders are also re-assessing whether to ship more Algerian urea to Brazil.
A part-cargo of 10,000t of Russian prilled urea for June ship- ment has reportedly traded at $305-310/t cfr Santos, with an additional 5,000t at $310-315/t cfr for delivery at Recife. The vessel totalling 30,000t includes around 20,000t of AN.
Urea imports down one third January-May
Imports of urea fell by 33pc year-on-year in the first five months of 2015, a drop of more than 500,000t. Overall im- ports were 1.025m tonnes down from 1.55m tonnes January- May 2014. May imports were 179,000t, compared to 370,000t in May 2014.
Imports are forecast to fall back from last year’s record total of 4.4m tonnes due to the weaker real that has pushed up prices for imported fertilizers and poor outlook for crop prices. But the drop in imports in the first half of 2015 is larger than anticipated and may this trend may continue into the second half of 2015, given the resistance from urea buyers seen since mid-May.
Peru
Trammo has fixed a vessel to load 35,000t of prilled urea
13-15 June in Kotka for four port discharge. It sold the urea to Yara in May.
Chile
Ameropa is in the freight market for a vessel to load 35,000t of urea in Qinhuangdao, China, for 2-3 ports in Chile 10-15 June and 25,000t from Basuo. CHS will also load 25,000t
of Chinese granular urea for Chile in June. Buyers are now checking prices for July shipments.
Ammonium Sulphate/Nitrate
Mexico
Further to last week’s report, Mexican ammonium sulphate producers have contacted us to say that the market is not short and that they have sufficient production and inventory to cover market needs for the coming season. One said that it had nearly two months’ production in store in its ware- houses ready to meet buyers’ requirements.
ANIQ, the Mexican producers' association, said: "national production and existing inventories fully guarantee total domestic consumption for this agricultural season."
The four Mexican producers, Agrogen, Fertiquim, Fertirey and Univex, have a combined capacity to produce nearly 1.9m tonnes/year of ammonium sulphate, whereas the mar- ket is about 1.6m tonnes annually.
Imports from the US and China, which supplied about 350,000t in 2014, have been blocked since March by a provi- sional anti-dumping duty. A final determination on the case is expected later this month following a public hearing.
In April, an incident at one of Pemex’ facilities led it declare force majeure on some ammonia. Some domestic receiv- ers have been on allocation since then, but gas supply to another ammonia unit should be restored around 14 June increasing supply.
Brazil
Offer prices for European and US capro grade standard amsul for June shipment have moved up to $175/t cfr Paranagua and OCI is indicating $185/t cfr for July shipment/August arrival. The move follows sales of Chinese capro grade amsul for June loading in the mid-$160s/t cfr Rio Grande. One 25,000t vessel has sold at that level and smaller parcels have been sold in other ports.
Licensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP
Granular amsul prices have also moved up, with some small lots of European and US product reported at $235/t cfr Para- nagua for July shipment.
Russian ammonium nitrate for June shipment is on offer at $230/t cfr Paranagua from Fitco and others. One sale is reported at that level.
Turkey
OCI loaded 25,000t of amsul in Antwerp this week for Aliaga and Tekirdag on a vessel fixed at $18.25/t.
Russia
One producer sold 4,000t of steel grade amsul to a trader in early June at a price equivalent to $123-124/t fob Kherson. A 2,500t parcel of Russian steel grade amsul was sold via Novorossisk at $118-120/t fob equivalent.
OCI and Borealis in France but the increase will change that.
Lithuania
Achema has sold around 30,000t of AN to its usual custom- ers for September shipment to the UK and France. The price is €5/t higher than for August at close to €250/t fob in big bags.
Russia
Vertiqal is in the market for a vessel to load 11-12,000t of bagged AN in Novorossisk in the first half of July for Beira, Mozambique.
Eurochem will load 10,000t of AN in combination with 25,000t of granular urea in the Black Sea in July for the US Gulf. It is reporting a sale of 10,000t of AN to an African market at $220/t fob bulk for early-July shipment.
China
Sinopec sold 6,000t of capro grade amsul to Koch late last week at $133/t fob for end-June loading. Koch is being quoted up to $138/t fob for another 4,000t to complete the cargo. Luxi is reported to have sold 3,000t to another buyer at $136/t fob for June. The market remains tight for June and early-July, although some additional supply could emerge in July when factories complete there maintenance turnarounds.
Traders are selling parcels of capro grade in Brazil at $165/t cfr, netting back in the mid-$130s/t fob China from floating cargoes. Southeast Asian markets are paying up only slowly, however, with the sale this week in Thailand netting below current market levels.
Steel grade prices have fallen slightly this week, with good quality material offered at $128-129/t fob.
Thailand
TCCC has bought 10,000t of capro grade amsul from a trader in the low-$150s/t cfr for June shipment, freight from China is estimated at $20/t.
France
Yara raised its AN 33.5 and CAN 27 prices by €7/t on 10 June with immediate effect. The new official prices are €292/t and €237/t cpt bulk respectively. This is a relatively large monthly step up and suggests that uptake from distributors has been good at the new season starting price of €285/t cpt for AN. Yara’s CAN price was €2-3/t lower than those from
Ukraine
Ostchem has announced that it may start to produce AN again at its Cherkassy plant based on bought in ammonia so that it can supply the Ukrainian market with the product needed in the autumn. With Russian blocked by an anti- dumping duty, NF has a crucial position in supplying AN to Ukrainian farmers.
Morocco
Eurochem has sold 10,000t of AN via LDC to buyers in Mo- rocco at a reported price of $243/t cfr bulk. Freight from the Black Sea is estimated in the high-$20s/t.
UAN Solutions
US
Following import business as low as $216/t cfr and prelimi- nary fill business as low as $205/st fob Nola in recent weeks, the US UAN market has stabilized and prices for summer delivery have moved higher. However, with side dress ap- plications winding down in the Corn Belt there is little if any demand for prompt tons from Nola. Prevailing prices have now transitioned from in-season to fill values.
Offers for June and July loading UAN at Nola are now in the range of $210-215/st fob Nola. Meanwhile, Eurochem has sold 30-33,000t of UAN 32 at $235/t cfr for late-July/early- August arrival to two ports on the east coast. Agronova is in the market for a vessel to load 40,000t of UAN 32 in the first half of July for the US east coast. Price indications are

$235-236/t cfr.
Consensus among traders is that CF will announce its sum- mer fill programme over the coming weeks at about $215/st fob Nola, although there is a wide range of opinions on the price. Last year’s fill price was issued in mid-June at $235- 240/st fob Nola.
In the export market, Nitron has purchased two parcels totalling about 50,000t of UAN 32 from CF for June-July shipment to Argentina and Uruguay. Prices have not been confirmed but are rumoured to be in the range $185-195/t fob, based on the selling prices in South America.
Canada
One inquiry is circulating for 18-20,000t of UAN 32 for sum- mer shipment to outside the Great Lakes.
Argentina
Bunge is reported to have purchased 25,000t of UAN 32 from Nitron for July shipment in the mid-$230s/t cfr.
Russia
Eurochem has sold around 33,000t of UAN 32 for first half July shipment to the US east coast at a price netting back around $195/t fob Novorossisk.
Belarus
Grodno Azot will hold a sales tender on 12 June for 25,000t of UAN 32 for June shipment from the factory.
Egypt
Abu Qir is planning to resume UAN production during June and could have 25,000t available for end-June lifting.
France
The most recent sales took place at €193-194/t fca Rouen for UAN 30 for delivery in the second half of 2015, but suppliers have withdrawn offers at that level now and the only offers are for Lithuanian suppliers at €195-197/t fca for October-No- vember delivery. Helm is indicating €200/t fca for forward delivery but no one will pay that price at present.
The market is very quiet. An estimated 600-700,000t of UAN have been sold for delivery up to December, ahead of the same time last year, so there is no need for buyers to step in.
