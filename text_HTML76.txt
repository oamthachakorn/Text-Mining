ANALYSIS
Subdued are the phosphate markets, east and west
With the exception of Pakistan where there has been a flurry of interest, buying activity has been subdued across much of the globe over the past week. In India and Brazil where both markets should be at the height of their import season, the impasse between buyers and sellers continues.
Pakistan has seen further buying interest this week with a sale from China and Saudi Arabia reported but with a higher price paid for the Chinese material, thereby bucking the normal trend. Much of the Chinese DAP coming into Pakistan is sourced from the Hubei Yihua plant and is well respected in the marketplace and the gap in price between the various origins is beginning to narrow accordingly. Firmer freights from China have supported a drive for higher prices also.
Although indicating higher prices in Pakistan and achieving some increase compared with previous sales, Chinese suppliers are unlikely to achieve a similar increase in India. Indian importers continue to put pressure on suppliers to reduce prices from the $480/mt CFR level by $7-10/mt to a range of $470-475/mt CFR. The rupee has been particularly volatile this week, spiking to INR64.3 at the beginning of the week to INR63.6 against the dollar at presstime today. The latter rate raises importers' margins at $480/mt CFR (and a MRP of INR 24,000/mt) from 1% to 2% but this still excludes any provision for hedging or interest payments against delayed subsidies.
Much depends on the monsoon but in theory India still has substantial tonnes to buy for the Rabi season despite the large quantities already booked to date. Low stocks and low production levels have prompted the greater H1 volumes of import tonnage booked. It can slow down its import programme and is likely to do so as it watches the monsoon but will not want to delay too late to avoid a similar situation to 2014 when a last minute surge in demand coincided with the Chinese autumn season and prompted a spike in
price. Nevertheless China, although currently in the peak export season with no alternative afforded in the domestic season or indeed much outside the Indian subcontinent, can play the waiting game also and it still remains to be seen who buckles first.
The Brazilian market remains very quiet as farmers assimilate the new Harvest Plan with its additional funding but with the higher interest rates that go with it. The weak crop prices are a real problem and with a higher cost of credit, farmers may continue to cut back on phosphate usage. This week's ANDA data make gloomy reading with a drop of 26% in consumption of P2O5 in May, the largest monthly reduction to date this year and well below the level of May consumption in previous years. Here buyers are also resisting suppliers' attempts to drive prices higher for July and the impasse is expected to last for another week or more before one or other caves in.
Mosaic will continue to ship to India, and presumably add cargoes for Brazil once a price agreement is found. However, the key for the producer remains the domestic market even though seasonal demand has been met. Mosaic is expected to begin railing refill tonnes to its consignment warehouses in July, and these volumes will reduce its need to search for further export opportunities. So far competing phosphates from China or Morocco are not on the radar for the US Gulf, although Russian suppliers appear willing to accept US returns on small volumes.
Highlights of the Week
∙Two new sales reported for Pakistan in mid-upper $480s/mt CFR
∙Lithuanian DAP sold into Turkey at around $510/mt CFR
∙Phosacid negotiations start but no agreement
∙Demand in South Africa as Moroccan and Saudi tonnes sold
∙Mosaic will refil US domestic maw over summer.
Sulphur
∙Global spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards march, with higher indications particularly from the Middle East and China. Tasweeq's latest 35,000 mt tender was heard awarded in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB, and Chinese deals were reported as high as $165/mt CFR.
Ammonia
∙Lack of clarity over price direction continues to stall ammonia activity. Despite weak demand east of
Suez, prices edged up slightly on CJ Indonesia’s reported tender award at $448/mt CFR.
Short Term Outlook
The Brazilian market continues to disappoint and although there are some still anticipating a last minute surge in buying for the September season, current economics would suggest otherwise with more of the same hand to mouth buying expected going forward. With US domestic prices also attracting no import interest for the coming months, the attention will focus on the Indian subcontinent to provide much of the activity over Q3 and probably the direction for the market. Both Brazil and India are needed to support the market during this period but without much impetus from either, prices may falter. So much therefore depends on the monsoon, even just from a psychological standpoint, as we head into Q3 and the start of the next round of import activity.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US S Plains: Wet weather halts further phosphate use
Soybean growers in the South are behind in their planting work due to flooding, and distributors predict many of those farmers will focus on planting before worrying about applying phosphate and potash. In some areas fertilizer applicators will follow the planters, but distributors do not report much demand from retailers.
Nevertheless southern states to the east continue to attract new sales to retailers, and prices have not moved at the distributor level in a couple of weeks.
US Midwest: Little movement expected ahead
Distributors do not expect to move much more phosphate in the coming days and weeks. Postings for DAP remain around $460/st FOB. Some barges still are discharging at northern terminals, and the supply chain in the region is ending the season with more carryover than normal, according to players throughout the region.
US Tampa: Modest interest does little to support market
Mosaic reported a further 17,000 mt of DAP sales this week to multiple Latin American markets. All of the material will load in July and was sold at $470-474/mt FOB Tampa, a $1/mt lower range than the prior couple of weeks.
Markets in the Americas are generally relying on Brazil to set the price for any large purchases in coming weeks, but buyers in that market have not been able to reach a meeting of the minds with suppliers on price for forward purchases.
US NOLA: Lack of interest in prompt DAP
Prompt inquiries are rare at this stage for DAP and MAP, although indications reported from suppliers are $415-425/st FOB. There is greater interest in forward DAP barges that would be available in the Gulf during September. However, at least one importer responded with bids basis open origin material at $440/st FOB for that month. So far there is no support for that price.
US: DAP/MAP exports slightly better than steady
US DAP/MAP exports during May were down modestly compared to May 2014, but not enough to change the trend for the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year through May with shipments moderately ahead of the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.
May 2015 exports of DAP/MAP were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared to 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5. Increases and decreases in shipments to traditional customers varied over the month, with the largest decrease seen in shipments to Canada, which fell to 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5 in May of 2014. The largest customers for US DAP/MAP in May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5.
For the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, DAP/MAP exports reached 1.98 million st (1.8 million mt) P2O5, compared to 1.78 million st (1.61 million mt) P2O5. Much of the year-over-year gain can be traced to shipments to India, which rose to 362,462 st P2O5 from 231,088 st P2O5 over the relevant periods. Other key customers for US DAP/MAP during the current fertilizer year through May were Brazil at 472,167 st (P2O5) and Canada at 287,065 st P2O5.
Mexico: Fertinal committed through to September
Deliveries to Chile and the local market through June, July and August mean that Fertinal remains fully committed through to September. Production continues to return to normal.
Fertinal is currently loading around 35,000 mt DAP, MAP and TSP on the Western Feodora for Chile. The balance of June production, estimated at around 70,000 mt and mostly DAP with some MAP, will be delivered into the local market, split between commitments of around 15,000 mt to NW Mexico and close to 20,000 mt delivered by truck and rail to nearby customers.
For July Fertinal will load another 35,000 mt combination cargo for Chile with a second such cargo, due to load end July/early August. The balance of July's production, estimated at around 70-75,000 mt, will be delivered into the local market.
An estimated 40,000 mt will be delivered into NW Mexico in August and a further 35,000 mt Chilean vessel will load either late August or September. Depending on the timing of this last Chilean shipment, a trader has booked 30,000 mt Mexican MAP/DAP for likely shipment to South America.
Production levels have been slowly but steadily improving, rising from a monthly output of 65,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP in May up to around 70,000 mt in June and a further increase in July/August expected to reach nearer 75,000 mt.
The increase has been in part facilitated by the two supplementary rock cargoes booked from Senegal, covering the shortfall caused by previous technical issues in the mine curtailing production but which are now being resolved. The first of these cargoes arrived on the Cano at the end of May and the second will arrive on the Ultra Iris at the end of June. No further imported rock cargoes are planned at this time.
Price levels for Mexican DAP and MAP have firmed up to $475-480/mt FOB with the higher price achievable in Chile where Fertinal has a freight advantage over other potential suppliers. Mexcian TSP is priced at around $385-390/mt FOB.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Import interest wanes and prices stall
The Brazilian import market remains very quiet with buyers resisting moves by suppliers to raise the price for MAP 11-52-0/12-52-0 above $500/mt CFR to $505-510/mt CFR, as is currently indicated for Russian and Moroccan product. As such the price range for this week has been assessed at $498-500/mt CFR.
OCP is currently in discussions with buyers for July shipments but as yet no tonnes have been placed.
Demand for Chinese 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 has started to ease off in China as few traders want to take positions for cargoes from mid July onwards for fear of both port congestion and demand worsening through August/September. As such prices in China for new sales of 11-44-0 for H2 July onwards have dropped off to $370-375/mt FOB giving landed prices sub $400/mt CFR depending on freight. For near term delivery into Brazil, prices are still in the low $400s/mt CFR.
YUC is producing granular 11-52-0, essentially for the Brazilian market, with its earliest shipment by the end of June and one cargo per month available through Q3 if needed.
Heavy congestion is being reported at Paranagua this week with delays of between 10-30 days reported at the fertilizer quays where a total of 24 vessels are expected, including 4 carrying MAP. At Santos, there is a
delay of 11 days with 10 fertilizer vessels expected. Delays at the fertilizer terminals at the other main Brazilian ports are currently less than 5 days.
Brazil: ANDA data show 26% drop in May P2O5 use
The latest ANDA data show a 19% drop in January-May P2O5 consumption with a 26% decline in May itself against 2014. The actual volume of P2O5 consumed over the full five months was the lowest since 2011.
Imports of all phosphate fertilizers into Brazil fell by 27% year on year January-May with DAP down by 36% and MAP, SSP and TSP all down by 26-27% compared with the same period a year earlier. The import volume for this period was also 19% down on 2012.
By contrast, Brazilian production of phosphate fertilizers rose by 4% in the first five months compared with the same period last year. Both MAP and TSP output increased by 7% year on year.
Looking at the demand/supply balance we can see that the availability to date appears to be in balance with demand. More costly credit lines and lower crop prices continue to cast a cloud across the whole fertilizer market. Brazilian corn prices continue to fall below cost of production levels, and are likely to move lower as
the safrinha crop harvest rolls on. This is likely to see full season corn planting fall yet again once fieldwork begins in September and will continue to impact demand across the nutrients.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
FSU: Turkish sale netback in mid $480s/mt FOB Baltic
EuroChem sold 25,000 mt Lithuanian DAP into Turkey for early July shipment at around $510/mt CFR cash duty free. With a freight rate in the mid $20s/mt, the netback is in the mid $480s/mt FOB Baltic.
Negotiations are ongoing for further sales into Turkey for July/August.
Sales to nearby and domestic markets have left Belorechensk sold out until 15-20 July. For Kingisepp, a cargo for mid July is now available. EuroChem is indicating $505-510/mt CFR for July shipment to Brazil. At current freights this would netback to $484-489/mt FOB Baltic excluding trader's margin but Brazilian buyers continue to balk at paying above $500/mt CFR.
EUROPE
Turkey: Sale of 20,000 mt Lithuanian DAP
EuroChem has sold a 25,000 mt cargo of Lithuanian DAP into Turkey for early July shipment, in combination with 15,000 mt AS. The price for the DAP is heard around $510/mt CFR duty free cash and the buyer, although not confirmed at presstime, is believed to be Gubretas.
Gubretas would normally be receving regular supplies from Tunisia at this time but the DAP plant at Gabes is yet to restart production after the two month stoppage. An initial 20,000 mt DAP delivery was supplied by GCT at the end of May out of stocks at the Tunisian plant but until the plant resumes steady production, further deliveries into Turkey will remain suspended.
Buying has been subdued in Turkey since the IFA meeting when a flurry of DAP and NP cargoes were booked. To date up to 280,000 mt DAP has been booked. Assuming that the full quantity of 100,000 mt is shipped from Morocco, a further 100-120,000 mt DAP is still theoretically required, ideally for Q3 shipment, and buying activity should start to pick up over the coming weeks. Cargoes from Jordan and Lithuania, both duty free, are likely to cover any outstanding demand not met from Tunisia.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Saudi Arabia: New sales to Pakistan
Ma'aden sold a cargo to Engro/Pakistan over the past week in the mid $480s/mt CFR for late June/early July shipment. As reported last week, Sabic also has a cargo booked for Pakistan, to United Agro, for July shipment, also priced in the mid $480s/mt CFR, giving an estimated netback into the mid $470s/mt FOB RAK.
Saudi DAP has become more competitive in Pakistan, priced at or even below prevailing Chinese prices from Hubei Yihua and as such, the Saudi market share has risen this year to just over 55% of the import market to date.
Sabic reports two sales of MAP for July shipment to South Africa both priced in the mid $480s/mt FOB. The first 25,000 mt cargo is for loading on July 3 and the second 30,000 mt cargo on July 15. Netbacks on South African business from RAK are currently more attractive than for sales to Brazil.
This brings Sabic's sales for July to date to 85,000 mt DAP/MAP excluding any cargoes to its regular customers in India. As such Sabic is said to be sold out for July and indicating in the $490s/mt CFR India WC and Pakistan for August.
Tunisia: Little change at Gabes
The latest reports suggest that DAP production is yet to resume at Gabes due to further disruptions to rock supplies. Even though rock production has been resumed at the mines, there are still pockets of unrest disrupting the transport from the mines to some of the downstream plants. GCT had hoped to restart phosphoric acid production at the complex by the start of Ramadan but this does not appear to have been achieved as yet.
Morocco: OCP targets Brazil and Europe for July
Brazil and Europe, including Turkey, will be the target markets for Moroccan DAP and MAP in July. Price indications for Brazil are in the range of $505-510/mt CFR whereas for Europe OCP is quoting the same range as for June, around $510-515/mt FOB Morocco.
As yet no sales for July have been booked in either market but OCP sold a second 30,000 mt MAP cargo to South Africa for end-June loading at a price said to be close to $490/mt FOB.
Demand in Southern Europe is starting to pick up and with no DAP currently coming out of Tunisia, additional sales opportunities for Morocco will be present over the coming weeks.
For the Turkish market, OCP booked the first 30,000 mt DAP vessel against its agreement with Toros for up to 100,000 mt for June-September shipment. The vessel will load end June/early July.
Plans to load an 80,000 mt MAP/DAP vessel to the US in July are still under discussion and will depend on demand in the US. Prices at NOLA are still unattractive to potential off-shore suppliers, equating to around $450/mt CFR.
As previously reported, OCP will ship a panamax to China at some time in Q3 against its government- government agreement but the actual date has not yet been fixed.
NPK sales to Nigeria are also under discussion for July and as yet no tonnes are believed to have been booked.
OCP will ship 75,000 mt TSP against awards in the recent Bangladesh private sector tender for Q3 shipment. As reported previously, the netback on this business is in the low $400s/mt FOB Morocco.
The new 1 million mt DAP/MAP plant is still in the commissioning phase and is still scheduled to start commercial production in early Q3.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Bangladesh: Awards dominated by China
Although the final supplier details remain unconfirmed, awards for the 400,000 mt DAP in the Ministry of Agriculture's recent private sector tender will be mostly covered from China. Just one cargo has been awarded to Quantum/Australia.
Netbacks for the lowest-priced DAP offered from the Hubei Dongsheng plant are sub $460/mt FOB, but this is not reflective of the Chinese market today and is believed to be a result of trader positioning rather than actual netbacks offered by the producer.
Most of the offers were at around $490/mt CFR which would give a straight netback to China in the upper
$460s depending on freight and excluding margins. The netback on the Australian cargo is reportedly in the low-to-mid $470s/mt FOB Townsville.
Shipment has been requested by September.
India: Imports reach 1.45 million mt DAP in April/May
The latest data released by the Department of Fertilizers show DAP imports for the first two months of the current fertilizer year, April/May, of 1.449 million mt. The breakdown by origin is as follows:
854,000 mt from China
338,000 mt from Saudi Arabia
172,000 mt from Russia
55,000 mt from the US
30,000 mt from Jordan
In terms of importers over the April/May period, IFFCO and IPL received 383,000 and 279,000 mt respectively or some 46% of the total to date. Chambal, Kribhco and Zuari each took between 138-165,000 mt with the balance accounted for by TCL, Mosaic, Deepak, Shriram, PPL, MCFL and CIL.
In terms of NP/NPK imports over the same two month period, IPL imported 124,000 mt with Deepak and Kribhco at 44,000 mt and 38,000 mt respectively.
Of this total, 148,000 mt NP/NPKs were sourced from Russia and the balance of 58,000 mt from China.
India: Up to 2.5 million mt DAP imports still needed
Additional DAP cargoes have been added to the June line up over the past week bringing the new total to just over 1.2 million mt. Official DoF data show a further 1.45 million mt arriving through April/May (see separate update for further details). Together with the cargoes arriving through Q1, the total quantity imported for the Kharif season is now just short of 3 million mt.
Fertilizer Week estimates that about 1.5 million mt remains outstanding against the MoU agreements for the current fertilizer year (excluding the recent PhosAgro agreement which combines NPKs and DAP). Whereas
these agreements are not set in stone, we can assume that this quantity or thereabouts will be shipped over the forthcoming months to build up support for the Rabi season.
Rabi consumption over the past four years has averaged 4.7 million mt. Taking the 1.5 million mt MoU tonnage together with domestic production between July-March of an estimated 2.7 million mt (based on 300,000 mt/month average), total availability will be around 4.2 million mt.
Much depends on the level of Kharif consumption and the stocks that will remain by September. But given a healthy drawdown on inventory, this volume of 4.2 million mt would theoretically be insufficient to cover potential demand for the Rabi and leave some opening stock for the following year. It also assumes
a comparatively robust domestic output which in reality may not be sustained through the whole period, particularly if H2 phosacid prices remain on the higher side.
Therefore additional spot imports over and above the MoU tonnes could be needed of as much as 1 million mt (up to 2.5 million mt in total with MoU tonnes) through H2 but with the overall quantity dependent on how the monsoon eventually progresses. Ideally the bulk of these tonnes should be shipped July- September. Doubts over the monsoon at this time last year led to a delay in purchasing and a consequent surge in last minute imports during September/October, coinciding with the Chinese domestic market and consequently pushing prices up.
In 2014, a total of 1.23 million was imported into India in Q3, rising to 1.63 million mt in Q4, compared with 2.1 million and 747,000 mt in Q3 and Q4 2013 respectively.
Importers will prefer to avoid a late surge this year but will also want to delay the next tranche of spot buying to a) guage the behaviour of the monsoon and b) push prices down in the near term to provide some cushioning against the current rupee volatility.
The rupee has traded between 64.2 and 63.7 against the US dollar over the past few days as the currency markets speculate on US interest rates and the US Federal Reserve's next move.
Given a rate of INR 64 flat against the dollar and a maximum retail price of INR 24,000/mt, an import price of $480/mt CFR provides importers with a margin of barely 1% and does not include any provision for hedging or interest payments against delayed subsidies.
Importers therefore continue to push for numbers closer to $470/mt CFR which would provide a basic margin of 3%. Suppliers from China are resisting any move from current values, particularly in the light of the recent firming in freight rates.
Pakistan: Engro buys Saudi DAP in mid $480s/mt CFR
Engro has purchased a cargo of DAP from Ma'aden at a price in the mid $480s/mt CFR for end June/early July arrival. Pakarab is linked with a Chinese cargo in the high $480s/mt CFR and Fauji is also expected to finalise a cargo for June/July shipment by the end of the week. Against its recent enquiry, it received prices in the mid-high $480s/mt CFR, mostly of Chinese origin.
Engro will have had three DAP cargoes loading in May/June, two from Ma'aden and one Chinese cargo from Trammo. The reason for the decision to buy a third cargo was to lock in additional prompt tonnes for delivery by July 1 ahead of the proposed import tax increase. The threat of such an increase has since receded as reported last week in Fertilizer Week.
Suppliers have increased their price ideas into Pakistan for July with Chinese offers now in the high
$480s/mt CFR, having moved up from the low $480s/mt CFR for June. One of the arguments cited by suppliers of Chinese DAP is the higher freight, now being indicated at around $19/mt, up by $2-3/mt on previous rates.
Saudi tonnage has become as competitive as Chinese in some instances and as a result, out of the cargoes booked for 2015 arrival, over 55% has been souced from Saudi Arabia to date with 35% from China. This is a reversal of the trend seen last year which saw the market dominated by Chinese imports.
Including the Fauji cargo not yet confirmed, close to 440,000 mt DAP has been booked for shipment into Pakistan this year and represents close to half the import quantity required for the year.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Higher prices achieved in Pakistan
Firmer freights have been one of the main arguments cited by Chinese suppliers in price discussions in Pakistan for July cargoes. One sale has been reported this week in the upper $480s/mt CFR Karachi, up from the low $480s/mt CFR previously, which at current freights of around $19/mt would netback to the high $460s/mt FOB, still within the current price range published in Fertilizer Week.
Current prices for sales into South and Southeastern Asia, excluding India, are in the range of $467-470/mt FOB. For India the range is between the low-upper $460s depending on whether to EC or WC and size of vessel.
In India meanwhile the stalemate on price continues with buyers still pushing for a reduction of around $7- 10/mt in line with the rupee depreciation and suppliers maintaining a firm price nearer $480/mt CFR.
Of the 1.2 million mt in the line up to arrive into India in June, approximately 870,000 mt will have been shipped from China, a substantial quantity compared with previous years. It not only reflects the earlier start to the Indian DAP campaign due to lower opening stocks but also the increased flexibility afforded to Chinese suppliers following the removal of the export window.
One question frequently asked is how much DAP the Chinese producers can store at the ports. This is particularly relevant given the current situation in India at the moment with buyers holding off while they gauge the progression of the monsoon and at the same time put pressure on the price.
Prior to 2014 producers were bound by the rigid export windows and therefore tried to push as much into bonded warehouses as possible ahead of the closure of the export windows. The time taken to transport product along the Yangtse river, for example, and into the ports, was also much longer, requiring more planning by producers.
This year there is no need for the bonded warehouses and the speed and efficiency not only of the transport to the ports but the throughput at the ports has meant that for many producers it is merely a few days from leaving the plant to being available for export at the seaports.
A lower volume of other commodities has also freed up capacity at the ports for fertilizers. As such producers can be more flexible and act at relatively short notice on export orders. This is partly why inventory levels reported at the ports this year have been comparatively low. In terms of actual storage, it is estimated that as much as 1 million mt DAP could be stored if necessary.
Availability for 11-44-0 from mid July onwards has increased as traders back away from taking positions for the Brazilian market for H1 July onwards. As such prices have weakened to the $370-375/mt FOB range for this period.
YUC has confirmed the production of granular 11-52-0 and will load its first cargo at the end of June and will have around one cargo per month thereafter if demand is there.
FEDERATED STATE OF ASIA
Vietnam: Chinese cross-border tonnes dominate
Chinese cross-border DAP is priced at around $475-480/mt CFR in bags, a level too cheap for product coming through the seaports to compete with. As such interest in bringing any vessels into Vietnam through the official import channels remains extremely limited.
TSP
EUROPE
Bulgaria: Iran takes 75% of TSP exports
Q1 data, as reported by GTIS show Bulgarian TSP exports at 95,000 mt and amost exclusively shipped into Iran. This brings the total export volume to all destinations for the 12 months ending March 2015 to 250,000 mt of which 187,000 mt, or 75%, were shipped to Iran.

INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Sri Lanka: MoA issues new TSP tender
The Ministry of Agriculture issued a new tender for 28,000 mt TSP, plus urea and MOP, closing on June 29 for delivery in bags by the end of September.
Against the MoA's earlier tender that closed on June 9 for 18,000 mt TSP, an award is due to be confirmed within the next 2 days to Swiss Singapore for the full quantity. Swiss Singapore offered the lowest price in this tender at $339.33/mt CFR and $341.30/mt CFR with 180 and 270 days credit respectively.
PHOSPHORIC ACID
NORTH AMERICA
US: Phosacid exports got boost in May
US phosacid exports in May jumped 27.5% from one year earlier to 35,396 st (32,086 mt) P2O5, from 27,770 st (25,193 mt). However, the gain did not substantially change the trend over the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year that has closely mirrored the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.
The jump in May 2015 can be accounted for by the shipment of 8,079 st (P2O5) to Brazil, compared to no exports to that country one year earlier. The lion’s share of US phosacid exports in May were accounted for in the 16,886 st loaded for India.
For the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, US phosacid exports were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared with 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5 in the previous year.
The main customers for US phosacid in the current fertilizer year to the end of May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5. Canada has taken significantly less phosacid during the current fertilizer year through May compared with the prior year at 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Phosacid negotiations stall
Negotiations started this week in Dubai between OCP and its joint venture partners for Q3 contract shipments into India. Buyers are looking for a sizeable reduction in price against the current level of $805/mt P2O5 CFR while OCP is expected to be looking for a small increase or at least a rollover. These initial discussions did not however result in any agreement.
Bangladesh: BCIC issues tender for 50,000 mt phosacid
BCIC, on behalf of the DAP fertilizer Company (DAPFCL), issued a new tender for 50,000 mt solution phosphoric acid (52-54% P2O5) closing on July 29 for shipment in five lots of 10,000 mt solution to the CUFL jetty at Chittagong as follows: 1st , 2nd, 4th weeks of November, 1st and 2nd weeks of December.
PHOSPHATE ROCK
EUROPE
Poland: Update on Senegal rock project
In the 12 months ending March 2015, Grupa Azoty imported almost 230,000 mt rock from its mining concession in Senegal, almost double the volume imported in the previous 12-month period. It plans to reach 300,000 mt in the current calendar year.
The company is close to completing the feasibility study on the phosphate project. In a recent statement the chairman indicated that a decision on whether to proceed with extending the concession will be taken shortly, on completion of both the feasibility study and an environmental report. The existing mine is small with limited resources so to reach the group's aim of becoming self sufficient in rock, the development of a larger mine is necessary for which the cost has been estimated at PLN 500-600 million ($135-160 million). Police's annual rock requirement is currently around 1 million mt rock.
It is also working with the Senegalese government with a view to supplying fertilizers into Senegal and in February shipped 10,000 mt NPKs.
Bulgaria: Record rock imports
Agropolichim imported 152,400 mt phosphate rock in Q1 comprising 72,300 mt from Morocco, 55,000 mt from Syria and 25,000 mt from Jordan. While the volume from Syria was down on recent years, the quantity imported from Morocco increased.
Revamping work at Agroplochim's Devnya plant has led to increased demand for phosphate rock. In the 12 months ending March 2015, Bulgaria imported just over 600,000 mt phosphate rock, a record 12
month volume according to GTIS data.

EUROPE
Europe: NPK suppliers soon to set new prices
The European NPK market continues to see little activity but with demand building and significantly higher netbacks for producers sending NPKs to Asia, suppliers are expected to set higher prices in Europe shortly.
European NPK buyers are bidding around the $310-320/mt FOB level for Baltic Sea for 15-15-15, but suppliers see these prices as far too low and new prices are likely to be at least $335/mt FOB or the
equivalent when producers set their new season offers. For now, Baltic Sea 15-15-15 continues to be quoted in the range $320-335/mt FOB.
Belarus: NPK exports flat January-April
Belarus exported 211,000 mt NPKs between January and April, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.
Belarus sent 76,000 mt to Lithuania (with much of this volume re-exported), 60,000 mt to Poland and 36,000 mt to Ukraine, where import duty for Belarussian NPKs was suspended in August last year.
In the first quarter, Belarus exported 184,000 mt NPKs, a 10% increase year on year but in the month of April NPK exports fell 38% to 29,000 mt, with the majority of the exports going to Ukraine.
Belaruskali continues to expand its NPK production capability after launching its first NPK capacity in April, 2013. Last year the potash producer exported 181,700 mt NPKs, with 27,900 mt coming from its RU-1 facility and 153,800 mt from its RU-3 facility, which ramped up production capacity during 2014 to around 240,000 mt.
The company is planning to ramp up NPK production to as high as 720,000 mt/year in the coming years through the introduction of new NPK lines.
In 2014, Belarus exported almost 600,000 mt NPKs of which 34% went to Lithuania, 29% to Poland and 17% to Ukraine.

Nigeria: Industry suffers over lack of subsidy decision
Nigeria's fertilizer industry is currently paralysed by a lack of clarity over the future subsidy regime since President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29.
The current subsidy is 50% under the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) shared between the federal and state governments, according to the Fertilizer Producers & Suppliers Association of Nigeria (Fepsan).
"We have no idea of the rate and when it will happen," Fepsan Executive Secretary Ahmed Rabiu Kwa told Fertilizer Week. Suppliers are apprehensive and are holding off even though the farming season has begun, he said.
Nigeria currently imports 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 from a range of suppliers for use mostly on cereal crops. The industry body estimates potential NPK demand growth at 10% per annum and assesses the average NPK import price currently at $350/mt CFR.
OCP is currently discussing July shipments for Nigeria but nothing has yet been booked.
Fertilizer re-exports to neighbouring countries are prohibited by law.
