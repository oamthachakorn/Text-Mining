MARKET ANALYSIS
Potash market shows signs of stability on Chinese contract
By Tom McIvor
After recent declines global potash spot prices have stabilised this week as players analyse the impact of the new Chinese contract.
When BPC surprised the market by signing a $10/mt increase to
$315/mt CFR in China ahead of the other major suppliers last week, some had argued that the increase was not enough to stem falls in the spot markets. Still, the majority of sources expect the new price will support the spot markets and at least provide a floor for suppliers to push against.
Producers have now begun to go on the offensive and aim to secure increases across the spot markets. In Brazil, where recent price falls have been most evident, this week prices are stable at $335-350/mt CFR. While the current price remains well below suppliers’ previous target of $380/mt CFR, suppliers want to return to regular $350/mt CFR levels shortly as spring buying builds up.
In Southeast Asia, there have been some price increases this week on the Chinese contract news but suppliers remain well below their continued target of $350/mt CFR. In Malaysia, prices are not quoted below $315/mt CFR this week and suppliers want to bring Malaysian prices up towards the $330-335/mt range. In Indonesia, a tender for 100,000 mt MOP should signal whether prices can increase above the $330/mt CFR level seen in recent Indonesian tenders while in Vietnam some deals have been confirmed as high as $345/mt CFR.
Granular potash prices continue to be quoted at €300-310/mt CIF in Northwest Europe. Suppliers are pushing for prices as high as €320/mt FCA, which with current exchange rates would represent roughly $350/mt.
US NOLA prices weakened a little more this week and can now be seen as low as $350/st FOB, around a $20/st fall since the start of 2015 while fertilizer application has begun in the Midwest but prices remain in the wide range of $375-400/st FOB.
In China, port wholesale prices fell this week and are expected to move down towards the new Chinese contract price in the coming months. Values are seen in the FCA range of RMB 2,080-2,200 ($335-354)/mt for standard product, a fall from RMB 2,100-2,200/mt. Large volumes are expected to arrive into the country in the coming months and 1.4 million mt was imported in January and February this year.
All of the major suppliers are expected to also sign Chinese contracts at the $315/mt CFR level and quantities should be agreed within the next couple of weeks. BPC says it is currently in talks for firm volumes of at least 700,000 mt while Uralkali expects to sign firm volume quantities at a similar level to last year. BPC shipped roughly
1.8million mt to China in 2014 and is likely to ship at least 2 million mt in the coming year.

Despite a new benchmark potash price low in China, players still await news on India’s next 180 days contract. IPL is believed to be entering talks with major suppliers in the coming weeks but some do not expect to sign the contract until the second half of April as Indian players await news on the Nutrient Based Subsidy and with a set of holidays in the first half of the month.
IPL is expected to start negotiations seeking a rollover but it is likely that the new deal will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, roughly $330-335/mt CFR. Uralkali was last heard looking for at least a $20/mt increase on the current $322/mt with 180 days credit.
BPC has now made its voice heard. The company’s decision to undercut Canpotex and Uralkali’s price target for the Chinese contract has enhanced its standing when a little over a year ago there were major questions over how Belaruskali would respond to the collapse of its union with Uralkali.
The former cartel structure and price discipline of the major players has weakened and with new companies such as BHP Billiton set to join the market in the next five to ten years, competition is on the rise.

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.

INDIA
Indian NPK production could rise on higher phosacid price
India’s H1 2015 phosacid contract was signed at $805/mt CFR this week, an increase from $765/mt CFR in H2 2015.
With high phosacid prices a key reason for increased NPK production in India during 2014, the large price increase may cause even more Indian producers to switch from DAP to NPK production in the coming year to reduce costs.
However, with a slightly higher potash price expected when the H1 2015 contract is signed in the coming weeks, and if ammonia prices continue to fall in India, then producers may look to focus on products that can utilise lower ammonia costs, such as DAP.

Separately, PhosAgro is believed to have sold two cargoes of 10-26- 26 to India at $440/mt CFR, one to IPL for April shipment and the other to Deepak Fertilisers for March shipment.
IPL also bought roughly 60,000 mt of 16-16-16 from Acron for March shipment.
Indian NPK prices for 10-26-26 remain in the range of $435-440/mt this week.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
CHINA
China’s NPK imports near 200,000 mt in 2015
China imported 192,351 mt of NPKs in January and February, more than double the 85,446 mt imported during the same period in 2013, according to GTIS data.
China received 45% of the NPKs from Yara, while 24% came from Russian producers and 12% from Belgian producers. Romanian and Finnish producers also sent volumes exceeding 10,000 mt.
Chinese NPK demand was very strong in 2014 but NPK imports fell to 1.1 million mt from 1.3 million mt in 2013, partly due to increased domestic supply. With some small Chinese NPK plants down during March due to environmental concerns, NPK imports in March may have also had to increase compared to normal.

Field work begins in US Midwest
Fertilizer applications have begun in the Midwest, but the price range for granular potash remains a point of contention.
Some suppliers west of the Mississippi River report sales continued at $375/st FOB, while buyers elswhere in the region reported price demands as high as $410/st FOB. While field work is starting slowly, ground conditions are improving and the next two weeks should see substantial application work and further shipments to retailers to meet demand.

Malaysia’s full-year NPK exports more than double
Malaysia exported 220,564 mt of NPKs in the full year 2014, more than double the 98,504 mt it exported in 2013, according to GTIS data.
More than 200,000 mt of the exports went to Indonesia, with small volumes also going to Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
Malaysia imported 331,141 mt of NPKs in the full year 2014, largely flat against its 2013 imports.
The country’s trade flow was similar to previous years with NPKs from Belgium and Holland making up roughly 40% of the exports. Indian, Russian, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Norwegian, Chinese and Swiss producers all sent volumes exceeding 10,000 mt to Malaysia in 2014.
Palm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and following flooding in the first quarter of 2015, NPK imports may fall in upcoming January and February data compared to 2014.
Buyers holding out for lower prices again
The re-opening of much of the upper Mississippi River over the prior two weeks is revealing demand for spot granular potash barges.
However, up river buyers, as well as traders along the Arkansas River are bidding as low as $340/st FOB New Orleans this week, despite reports of business at $355/st FOB in the prior couple of weeks.
Meanwhile, indications from BPC suggest it will not begin another round of potash exports to the US before Q3, presumably targeting arrivals in time to move north as fill sales over the summer.

BRAZIL
Brazil prices at stable low following Chinese contract
Brazilian potash prices are not quoted below $335/mt CFR this week as news of the new Chinese contract may have signalled an end to the freefall in values.
The spot price in Brazil has fallen by $35-40/mt since the start of 2015 amid a seasonal lull in demand and weak real exchange rates.
While imports fell 19% in the first two months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, suppliers hope that with spring buying season building up and a benchmark low set on the Chinese contract, prices will soon begin firming.
Prices in Brazil are now seen in the range of $335-350/mt CFR, a significant distance from suppliers’ price target in Q4 2014 of $380/mt CFR but sources say that suppliers are looking to firm the price back to $350/mt CFR in the coming weeks.
EUROPE
European potash prices yet to reach targets
Some potash suppliers have yet to reach their target price in Europe but recent exchange rate improvements have meant that potash deals are now seen in a similar price range to both Brazil and US NOLA.
Prices are quoted at €300-310/mt CIF after Uralkali joined SQM and ICL at a price of €315-320/mt FCA for gMOP recently. Suppliers are seeing more deals at €315/mt FCA but are yet to achieve €320/mt FCA deals.
Even the €315/mt price translates to $347/mt at current exchange rates, slightly above the current average potash price in Brazil and roughly $5/mt below the average US NOLA price, meaning that the European price is not as comparatively weak as seen in previous weeks.
In the twelve months ending March 12, the euro fell 32% against the dollar but in the last two weeks there has been a 4.2% recovery, slightly improving the return for potash suppliers in Europe.

ICL explores NOP plant option
ICL is considering an NOP plant to increase its production of soluble fertilizers and food-grade phosphoric acid, the company said in a statement.
The company’s plan is part of its previously announced ‘Next Step Forward’ growth strategy in order to deal with what it considers increased demand for specialty fertilizers and to secure more of ICL’s internal needs.
ICL has started a project to study the best locations for a new NOP plant based on considerations like the supply of raw materials, logistics and proximity to customers.
ICL has also launched a GBP 50 million expansion plan at the Cleveland Potash mine in the UK, according to media reports. The company plans to build a granulation plant which could be operative in three years, turning fine polyhalite into granules for agricultural use.
The company’s Dead Sea Works and Bromine operations in Israel continue to be suspended due to strikes over lay-offs and a two-week negotiating period between unions and ICL goes on.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
INDIA
NFL tenders for 50,000 mt of potash
India’s National Fertilizers Ltd. issued a tender for the import of 50,000 mt of MOP, which closes on April 13.
The tender is for H1 May delivery in two shipments of 25,000 mt across multiple Indian ports.
It is likely that an agreement over the next Indian H1 potash contract will be signed before the closing date so offers should be based on the new price.
RCF also has a tender for 145,000 mt of MOP which was extended last week to close March 31, from March 18, in order to have an idea of the new contract price. The H1 2014 contract price is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit and the new contract is likely to be signed by early April.
MMTC potash tender extended
India’s MMTC extended the closing date on its import tender for 145,000 mt potash and another 200,000 mt at the company’s option.
The new closing date is March 27, rather than March 16.

26 March 2015
Last week, India’s RCF extended the closing date on its tender for 145,000 mt potash along with 120,000 mt of optional tonnage to March 31 from March 18.
Both tenders will be a strong indicator for the new Indian contract price, which is expected to be settled around the start of April. The current Indian contract is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit.
Of MMTC’s firm quantity, 75,000 mt is for April delivery, 30,000 mt for May delivery and 40,000 mt for June delivery at Indian ports.
New Indian contract awaiting NBS rate
IPL is believed to be entering talks with major suppliers in the coming weeks regarding the new Indian H1 2015 contract price but
some suppliers are not expecting to sign the major deal until the second half of April.
With the new Chinese contract signed at a $10/mt increase following a significant delay, Indian players should enter talks shortly, but buyers want confirmation that the Nutrient Based Subsidy will be unchanged for potash. The new NBS should be in place in the next couple of weeks.
IPL is expected to start negotiations seeking a rollover but it is likely that the new deal will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, roughly $330-335/mt CFR. Uralkali were last heard looking for at least a $20/mt increase on the current $322/mt with 180 days credit deal.
Demand for potash is expected to remain high in the coming year and news of a higher Indian phosacid contract price may push more fertilizer companies in India to increase MOP imports and produce more NPKs rather than DAP. Current MOP import estimates for the upcoming fertilizer year are 4.5-5 million mt.
There are just two potash shipments scheduled for the coming week. A 22,486 mt shipment from BPC to Chambal and a 17,856 mt shipment from Canpotex to TCL.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
CHINA
China imports more than 600,000 mt of potash in February
China imported 629,208 mt of MOP in February, 18% more year on year and its largest February MOP imports since 2007, according to GTIS data.
During the month, China imported 236,046 mt from BPC, an increase from just 46,944 mt in February 2013. The country also imported 148,851 mt from Uralkali via rail, 124,277 mt from Canpotex, 57,680 mt from APC, 38,320 mt from ICL and 23,445 mt from K+S.
So far in 2015, China’s MOP imports are up 34% compared to the same period in 2014, at 1.4 million mt.
Fresh cargoes have continued to arrive into China in recent weeks. 12 vessels with nearly 400,000 mt arrived or are scheduled to arrive in March while at least 300,000 mt is due in April, according to sources.
Much of the volumes have been sent to bonded warehouses

mt rather than its normal 40,000 mt. Following settlement of the Chinese H1 2015 deal, these larger inventories should begin returning to normal.
Quantities for the new contract have yet to be agreed by BPC but are expected to be in the coming week or so. BPC said this week that it is currently in talks with three buyers for firm volumes of at least 700,000 mt altogether.
The other major suppliers are expected to also sign contracts at the $315/mt CFR contract price in the coming weeks. Uralkali currently expects to sign firm quantities at a similar level to last year.
INDONESIA
Sinar Mas tenders for 100,000 mt
MOP
Indonesia’s SMART (Sinar Mas) tendered for 100,000 mt of potash, according to sources.
The tender closed last week but a decision is unlikely until the first week of April.
All major suppliers are said to have made an offer as part of the tender and they continue to target $350/mt CFR, according to sources. Still, an offer may have already been made at $335/mt CFR, which could be a sign that the tender will be awarded at around $330/mt CFR.
The last major Indonesian tender, by Petrokimia Gresik’s for 100,000 mt, was awarded at roughly $330/mt CFR.
In September 2014, Sinar Mas tendered for 100,000 mt in a deal which was awarded to Canpotex, which regularly provides potash to Sinar Mas.
Sinar Mas is a local tender, supplied by local distributors from their inventories and as such it requires pricing on a delivered basis to each of their plantations, making it difficult to determine the actual price offered by the local participants.
China's domestic potash prices slide after contract settlement
China's port wholesale prices have fallen this week following news that BPC settled its Chinese H1 2015 contract as $315/mt CFR, an increase of $10/mt.
Prices are seen in the FCA range of RMB 2,080-2,200 ($335-354)/mt for standard product, a fall from RMB 2,100-2,200/mt. Deals for the white 62% K2O product are currently being made below RMB 2,220/mt with unconfirmed deals as low as RMB 2,150/mt.
Most buyers continue to expect large volumes to arrive in the coming months after 1.4 million mt entered the country in January and February.
Some buyers have been building inventories in recent months, for example one medium NPK plant built up MOP stocks to 100,000
MALAYSIA
Malaysian potash imports reach 1.6 million mt in 2014
Malaysia imported 1.6 million mt of potash in the full year 2014, a 29% increase on its 2013 imports and its largest recorded yearly imports, according to GTIS data.
The country imported more than 600,000 mt of potash from Canpotex, which slightly increased its overall volumes to Malaysia but lost almost 10% of its market share as Uralkali and BPC increased their sales to Malaysia. Uralkali more than tripled its volumes to Malaysia in 2014, sending 338,778 mt while BPC more than doubled its volumes, sending 288,470 mt.

Weekly Market Report
26 March 2015
In December, Malaysia imported 65,496 mt of potash, a fall of 41% compared to December 2013. The country imported 18,499 mt from Uralkali and 28,495 mt from BPC.
The increase in potash imports is largely due to increased palm oil output in 2014, which rose 2.1% during the year to 20.09 million mt according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. In 2015, palm oil output is expected to continue its increase but at a much slower level due to recent flooding and weaker commodity prices.
Southeast Asian prices may firm on new Chinese deal
There are indications that Southeast Asian potash markets may be poised for a slight recovery following a first quarter dip after suppliers failed to regularly achieve their target of $350/mt CFR.
Prices in the smaller MOP market of Vietnam have been quoted as high as $345/mt CFR, a $10/mt increase from last week and a new Indonesian tender from Sinar Mas for 100,000 mt of potash is believed to have received offers in the range of $335-350/mt CFR.
Uralkali have signed one 25,000 mt cargo of standard and granular MOP to Vietnam at around $335/mt CFR while BPC signed two shipments to Vietnam of 35,000 mt each, with an average price of around $345/mt.
On the other hand, Malaysian prices are still quoted as low as
$315/mt CFR with bids recently made as low as $295/mt CFR due to the weak ringgit and agricultural commodity price. The region is also out of season.
Uralkali said it has sent a cargo to Malaysia as a regular deal with a regional NPK producer but was unwilling to announce the
price. Canpotex, Uralkali and BPC have signalled a price push in Malaysia, according to sources, and hope to move back up towards the $330-335/mt CFR range.
Next month, both Malaysia and Indonesia will reintroduce a palm oil export tax. While palm oil output is expected to improve slightly in the countries next year, a new report from the US Department of Agriculture's Kuala Lumpur bureau expects there will be a minor decline in Malaysian palm oil exports next season.
Overall Southeast Asian potash prices are seen higher than last week at $315-345/mt CFR rather than $310-335/mt CFR with the wide range due to weak prices in Malaysia and indications of prices in the $330-345/mt range in the other Southeast Asian markets.
BPC’s new Chinese contract price is 2-3% lower than the current average Southeast Asian spot price. With Southeast Asian spot prices often as much as 7% higher than the Chinese contract price, the new deal may also help to strengthen prices in the region ahead of the new Malaysian tender season in late April/early May.
SOP
EUROPE
European SOP prices up ahead of Q2 price discussions
European SOP prices have seen a slight increase to €450-470/mt FCA, following recent MOP price increases in the European market to offset the weak euro.
MOP producers are about to start discussions over Q2 prices and an increase in MOP prices will likely also force up SOP prices in the next quarter amid tight SOP supply until the second half of 2015.
The SOP prices represent normal short-term contract deals in the region as limited supply has meant spot deals are almost impossible to complete. K+S may have closed spot deals as high as €500/mt FCA according to some sources but these unconfirmed deals are not representative of the wider market.
Tessenderlo expects increased SOP production in the second half of 2015 once it has converted its plant in Ham, Belgium, to a stand- alone SOP unit while other suppliers may also bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year.
