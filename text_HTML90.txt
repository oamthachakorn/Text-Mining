ANALYSIS
Sulphur market shows cautious optimism
The sulphur market demonstrated further price rises without signs of dramatic increases. The current market tone is one of cautious optimism.
Aramco posted a price of $144/mt FOB for July, up $2/mt from June. The seller then reportedly fully sold out for the month a day after finalising the price. Some in the market had been expecting a slightly higher level in the $145-148/mt FOB range, although CFR levels have not yet increased to levels that can support such a level.
Market participants will be awaiting settlement of Tasweeq's next 35,000 mt tender, which closes next week.
There were also higher prices in China, with both domestic port prices and international prices reported higher. However, some concerns persist over Indian demand for Chinese phosphate exports weakening and a potential negative effect on sulphur demand from Chinese phosphate producers.
Indian prices were assessed stable with little new activity, but future business will likely have to be at higher levels given increases elsewhere.
JPMC's latest 50,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded in the low $160s/mt CFR, up from the mid-$150s/mt CFR achieved on its previous tender.
European Q3 contract negotiations have yet to begin, but no great change if any is expected.
Elsewhere, Brazil's May imports of sulphur plunged 37% year on year, leaving the total for the first five months roughly stable.
Highlights of the week:
∙Aramco posts $144/mt FOB for July
∙Chinese prices inch up further
∙Tasweeq issues latest tender
∙JPMC tender heard in low $160s/mt CFR
∙Brazil's May imports drop 37% on year
∙European Q3 contracts expected roughly stable
MARKETS
SULPHUR
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: May imports plummet 37%
Brazil's May imports of sulphur dropped 36.7% to 119,177 mt, leaving total imports for the first five months of the year roughly stable at 798,517 mt.
As with previous months this year, the May volumes came mostly from Kazakhstan and the USA, which supplied 38,500 mt and 38,298 mt.
The UAE supplied 37,446 mt, its highest monthly volume to Brazil since March 2012.
EUROPE
Med: Market stable but some regional variance heard
Mediterranean prices remain assessed at $130-135/mt CFR for lots of less than 10,000 mt, though sources have indicated that prices up to the $140s/mt CFR may be achievable in Turkey.
Sulphur burners in the region have indicated relief that sulphur prices in Q2 have been lower than in Q1, while sulphuric acid sales prices have been stable, allowing improved margins following more difficult months.
Elsewhere, a vessel was sought to move 19,000-20,000 mt lump sulphur from the Black Sea to Abu Qir, Egypt 18-19 June.
Europe: No major change anticipated for Q3 contracts
European market players mostly expect a rollover in Q3 sulphur contracts, though there are those pushing for settlements either side of this outcome.
Settlements for Q2 ranged from a rollover to a decrease of $5/mt or less, but the assessed settlement range for barge/railcar contracts remained $158-170/mt CFR, as no settlements were reported outside of this range. The main reason for the reductions was weakness in the euro relative to the dollar, which had left European buyers paying more for their contracts in euro terms.
Some sellers are likely to want to take advantage of current positive sentiment in global sulphur markets and push for an increase, while buyers are likely to want further decreases, as they report good availability.
Official negotiations have yet to begin, and market participants are hopeful that talks will not drag on as long as Q2 discussions did.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Jordan: JPMC tender heard in low $160s/mt CFR
JPMC's latest tender for 50,000 mt, which closed June 2, was reportedly awarded in the low $160s/mt CFR.
The buyer's previous tender for 50,000 mt, which closed on May 7, was awarded at around $155/mt CFR.
Meanwhile, it is understood that JIFCO is not currently seeking sulphur volumes. It last purchase was at $154-155/mt CFR. The JIFCO plant is currently running at around 95%.
Elsewhere, a vessel was sought to move around 25,000 mt of granular product from Bandar Abbas, Iran to Aqaba, Jordan.
Qatar: Tasweeq issues latest 35,000 mt tender
Tasweeq's latest 35,000 mt tender closes June 16, according to market sources.
The seller's last tender closed May 19 and was awarded in the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB.
Tasweeq's posted selling price for June volumes is $141/mt FOB, while recent spot sales from the Middle East have been reported in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB.
Saudi Arabia: Aramco posts $144/mt FOB for July
Aramco Trading posted a new contract price for July loading at $144/mt FOB Jubail, up $2/mt from its June price.
The buyer has reportedly already sold out for July volumes one day after finalising the July price.
It is also understood to have concluded a sale for 35,000 mt in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB.
The new price represents delivered prices to China around $160s/mt CFR.
Aramco previously increased its price by $2/mt to $142/mt FOB for June.
The price is further evidence of improved sentiment in global sulphur markets, but also reflects that dramatic price increases are not currently supported.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Prices unchanged on lack of fresh business
Indian prices continue to be assessed at $155-165/mt CFR given a lack of firm new indications, but prices at the lower end of this range are unlikely to be achievable on future deals given price movements elsewhere.
Although some buyers in India pegged prices at $155-60/mt CFR, traders thought $165-168/mt CFR would be more realistic.
Meanwhile, RCF awarded its 10,000 mt tender that closed May 15 to MRPL, which offered at INR 8,485/mt EXW.
India: MMTC issues 15-25,000 mt sulphur tender
MMTC has issued a tender for 15-25,000 mt for arrival at Cochin July 6-10.
The tender closed on June 9.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Domestic prices inch up further
Domestic prices for sulphur in China increased further this week, and there were also reports of higher prices on import business.
Spot offers for granular product at ports climbed to RMB 1,200-1,250/mt FCA, with transactions at around RMB 1,220/mmt FCA or above.
Traders were disappointed with the Aramco price for July, as they had been expecting a higher level to boost the current upward trend in prices. The $144/mt FOB price is equivalent to RMB 1220-1240/mt at port, matching current market prices.
Port inventories remained below 1 million mt at around 940,000 mt. Domestic producers also increased their prices.
Sinopec's Puguang increased its Wenzhou port price by RMB 10/t to RMB 1,200/mt FCA and its ex-factory price by RMB 20/mt to RMB 1,190/mt EXW. Sinopec's other refineries also increased prices by RMB 20- 50/mt.
On international sales, one trader concluded a deal for 50,000 mt at $159.80/mt CFR, at the upper end of the assessed range. There were also unconfirmed reports of a small cargo sold at $165/mt CFR. Sources reported bids from buyers as high as $160/mt CFR, demonsrtrating an increasing willingness to pay higher prices.
