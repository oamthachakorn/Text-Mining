ANALYSIS
Chinese strategy to support prilled prices pays off
The Chinese strategy to hold off on sales of prilled urea below $290/mt FOB is still working, and has provided producers with improving returns again this week. Sales are reported above the $300/mt FOB marker for prills to cover traders short on sales in India via the IPL tender and to Pakistan in the recent TCP sessions. Prilled values are now rapidly approaching those for granular urea.
Unlike prills, traders were generally cautious to short Chinese product in recent weeks, and attempts by sellers to secure traditional premiums for regular Chinese granular have not been successful. Superior Chinese product such as the China Blue granular does however still trade at premiums above $10/mt on prills.
A softer sentiment is definitely apparent for granular urea in the region, evidenced not only by limited buying interest in China, but also via low bids for the 60,000 mt premium quality product from Kaltim in Indonesia this week.
A shift in concentration from prilled to granular urea will obviously occur if regional values of the two grades should closely match, as enduser markets favour Chinese granular over Chinese prills.
The overall market for granular urea nevertheless depends increasingly on sustained values in the US barge market, but these were also southbound for forward positions this week.
Finding the trend for granular urea barges in the US has been problematc all year, as traders continually sold forward tons substantially lower than the prompt market. This pattern was repeated this week, as spot granular urea barges changed hands in the $330s-$340s/st FOB New Orleans while 1H July barges sold around $305/st FOB. This pattern has made the US less attractive than other markets for granular urea, which ultimately has led to thin supplies on a prompt basis for the last couple of months.
In Europe, buyers remain cautious and the majority of importers of granular product are yet to get on the band-wagon for significant quantities for August and beyond. Some buyers have nevertheless opted to hedge the forward market by purchasing parts of envisaged requirements close to current values. These decisions were undoubtedly influence by erratic output in North Africa in recent weeks.
Brazilian importers that were off for a holiday June 4 continued to play a waiting-game this week, evidently feeling convinced that a buyer's market will return in July. Procurement anywhere close to the offers in the high $330s/mt CFR currently on the table is not regarded an advisable move by the importers, despite repeat reports of Middle East cargos originally intended for Brazil being diverted to the US and Australia.
Prilled values were not only gaining in China. Limited availability out of the Black Sea following Group DF's decision to suspend urea output from Cherkassy triggered a 25,000 mt purchase by NF Trading to load in June to cover quantity-commitments via NF Italia, mainly to industrial clients. The $298/mt FOB Yuzhnyy price suggested in the deal did raise some eyebrows in the trade, as offers for smaller quantities from Yuzhnyy were available to load in June some $5/mt lower.
On the demand side, planting in the US slowed this week, with corn approaching completion. The US set 2015 blending volumes at 13.4 billion gallons, below market expectations and well below the 15
billion gallons that were legislated.
The Brazilian government has finally released the details of the 2015/16 Harvest Plan. President Dilma Rousseff announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the support programme, to BRL 187.7 billion ($59.8 billion), termed a 'generous surprise' by the Agriculture Minister Katia Abreu. While the overall level of support is deemed generous, it may not be entirely supportive for domestic fertilizer purchasing.
Farmers rely heavily on subsidised interest rates in production loans to purchase fertilizers. Funding allocation for these loans has been upped 7.5% y-o-y, to BRL 94.5 billion ($30.12 billion). For medium sized producers, production loan interest rates have been set at 7.75% per annum (p.a.), while larger producers who take a bulk of the funding will see rates of 8.75% p.a. These rates are close to market expectations. Last year interest rates were 6.5% p.a. Most of the funding increase has gone towards loans that will be available at market interest rates that are around 17-23% p.a.
While the 20% funding increase may seem favourable on the surface, it is unlikely to provide any significant support to fertilizer purchases. Brazilian delegates at the recent IFA conference voiced concerns over the availability of credit.
The Indian Meteorological Department continues to be downbeat on its monsoon forecast, this week lowering likely rainfall levels to 88% of normal (93% last week). Indications are for 66% chance of a 'deficient' monsoon and only a 6% chance of a 'normal' season.
Highlights of the week
∙Offers to TCP in Pakistan plentiful, but at high prices compared to India`
∙Kaltim fails to achieve targets in June 3 sales tender for 60,000 mt granular
∙US granular settles into more modest price-range
∙Chinese prilled values surge close to granular on trader shorts
∙New Indian urea tender yet to be announced but is suggested imminent
∙Pakistan's ECC clears more imports, but tenders yet to be floated
∙Brazilian importers reject high offers as news on increased credits emerge
∙Algerian exports continue and output to normalize shortly
Short term outlook
Mixed. Market perception remains for significant oversupply in Q3 and into Q4, but cuts in output and pockets of regional shortages could well support current values into July. Forward length point to significant downward adjustments in prices, but the timing of the corrections is still open for debate.
Continued price-strength beyond July 15 does however appear questionable and traders are already evaluating timing for possible short positions. Once and when over the "edge", urea values will undoubtedly suffer from lack of market liquidity, suggesting that downward corrections may be quite substantial.
MARKETS
UREA
NORTH AMERICA
US Southern Plains: Conditions still drying out
Retailers are adding to their urea positions but relatively little product has moved to the ground this week, mostly due to the soggy conditions. Once corn acres are more supportive for application equipment, a surge in demand is expected that distributors will find difficult to meet.
New tows have not been able to start up the flooded Arkansas River for a week and another week of at least slow movement is anticipated. As a result, truck values generally remain around $390/st FOB in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
US: April plunge in arrivals aided recent price strength
Even though the plunge in US urea imports during April was expected, much of the marketplace did not forecast quite such a decline as was reported this week by the US Department of Commerce. April arrivals fell to 695,753 st (631,183 mt) from 1.06 million st (963,427 mt) one year earlier. Apparent denial on the part of many traders about the April volumes likely fueled the strong prices seen in May's barge market.
Most of the decline in arrivals was spread relatively evenly across traditional suppliers to the US. Somewhat surprisingly the decline in shipments from Caribbean suppliers Venezuela and Trinidad was the most stark, with just 4,439 st arriving in April 2015 versus 151,704 st in April 2014. The largest suppliers to the US duiring April of this yea included Qatar at 170,685 st, UAE at 145,916 st and Canada at 127,139 st.
For the first 10 months of the US fertilizer year through April, US urea imports were 7.23 million st (6.56 million mt) versus 6.61 million st (6 million mt) for the prior year period. Key subscribers for July-April of this year included Qatar at 1.42 million st, China at 1.37 million st and Canada at 798,691 st. While the year- over-year totals still show a significant surge in US imports this year, the April shortfall and long-held anecdotal views that the US needed to make up for a severely depleted supply chain at the start of the fertilizer year suggest that US supplies are relatively snug given typical spring demand.
Canada: Urea imports and exports on the rise
Canadian exports of urea in April were up by 88.5% and January-April exports were lifted by 14.7%. January-April imports were up by 36%.
April exports of 142,000 mt were destined almost exclusively to the US, as was the January-April volume of 401,000 mt.
April imports of 104,000 mt were up by 10.2% on April 2014. The US accounted for 42,000 mt, down by 8.7%, while deliveries from Russia of 28,500 mt were up by 59%.
January-April imports of 281,000 mt were up by 36% on 2014, but arrivals from the US of 98,000 mt were off by 6.9%. Germany accounted for 34,000 mt, up by 53% while arrivals of 32,000 mt from Bahrain lifted imports from that nation from zero in the prior year. Russia accounted for 31,000 mt, Qatar for 21,000 mt, UAE for 19,000 mt and Kuwait for 17,000 mt.
US NOLA: Trades and prices pick up
The high end of the granular urea barge market started the week and generally held at $345-348/st FOB, but prompt barges also traded as low as $335/st FOB. Offers for 2H June barges were as high as $340/st FOB, but most trades occured at $316-320/st FOB. Forward business for 1H July is substantially discounted at $305/st FOB.
Meanwhile, full tows will not be able to move up the Arkansas River to Tulsa Oklahoma for as long as two weeks while flood waters ease.
There are reports that EuroChem's June cargo that was due in the Gulf June 11 now will not reach the Southwest Pass to the Mississippi River until June 16. A Koch cargo out of Oman previously expected in the first half of this month now appears likely to discharge at the end of the month. Finally, traders report CF Industries temporarily stopped making new truck sales out of Donaldsonville Louisiana plant this week in order to catch up on its barge commitments, but the company has not posted any news relating to the rumor.
Mexico: Interest in prilled and granular urea
Mexican importers indicate interest in additional volumes of granular urea for the West Coast (WCM) and there is also open interest in prills for the East Coast (ECM).
Indications from buyers for WCM granular are around $325/mt CFR, but importers appear in no hurry to cover, citing prospects of further price-concessions in coming weeks. Offers are well above $330/mt CFR despite the slight weakening in recent netbacks to Chinese producers.
Importers of prills for ECM are yet to concede demands from sellers of prills from the FSU based on FOB values from the Baltic and the Black Sea in the upper $290s/mt FOB and are aiming some $15/mt below indications around the $320/mt CFR marker.
Mexican imports of urea in March were up by a full 125% to 120,000 mt. Chinese product accounted for 58,000 mt, up from zero in March 2014. Deliveries from Russia of 49,000 mt were up by 5% to 49,000 mt.
Q1 imports of 215,500 mt were nevertheless only up by 8% on the prior year, but imports from China registered an increase of 254% to reach 119,000 mt. Arrivals from Russia were down by 34.4% to 82,000 mt and shipments from Qatar were down to zero from 33,000 mt in Q1 2014.
US Midwest/N Plains: Retailers travel farther for urea
Granular urea is in tight supply from the Dakotas to Illinois, although pricing has only moved modestly higher in recent days. Buyers in the Dakotas have been willing to shop for truckloads from Missouri and Iowa rather than risk delays possible when ordering by rail. As a result business in the last few days in the Dakotas has occured up to $400/st DEL this week, up $5/st from last week's high. On the other hand warehouse pricing in Iowa and Minnesota continues at $370-375/st FOB.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Peru: Urea imports through Q1 up significantly
Peruvian imports of urea identified by customs via GTIS in the first quarter of 2015 of 119,000 mt were up by 86.6% following a massive increase of 262% to 63,600 mt in the month of March. Deliveries in March from China of 43,400 mt were up from zero in March 2014 while Russian arrivals of 20,200 mt were up by 15%.
China also dominated Q1 imports with deliveries of 70,200 mt, up from zero in Q1 2014. Arrivals from Russia were however down by 26% in the quarter, to 48,200 mt.
Colombia: Imports of urea down significantly in Q1
Imports of urea by Colombia as identified by customs via GTIS in March were down by 22.6% on March 2014 to 24,400 mt. This brought the Q1 total to 71,000 mt, down by 35.4% on the prior year.
The imports in March and in the first quarter of the year were about equally split between supplies from China and Venezuela.
Renewed interest in imports of granular urea emerged this week for a cargo in combination with a requirement in El Salvador. Indications from sellers for Chinese product in the upper $330s/mt CFR for two ports on the west coast did not elicit significant buying interest.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Ukraine: Urea exports continue to trail prior years
Exports of urea from Ukraine continue to suffer from cutbacks in output from Group DF units and the overall instability in the country. March exports identified by customs via GTIS of 168,600 mt were down by 16% on March 2014, and Q1 exports of 436,000 mt were down by 13.9%.
March shipments of 85,000 mt to Turkey were down by 24%, but the 25,000 mt loaded for Spain was up from zero in March 2014. Shipments to Italy of 17,600 mt were off by 51%.
Turkey accounted fror 209,000 mt out of the Q1 volume, up by 9.5% on Q1 2014. Shipments to Spain were up from 6,600 mt to 59,000 mt while deliveries to Italy were down by 25.3% to 58,000 mt.
Black Sea: Prilled price up on NF purchase
Trading in prilled urea remains limited out of the Black Sea, mainly on limited availability following the closure of the Group DF plants, as reported last week. The cut in Cherkassy output triggered a purchase by NF Trading this week from a trader at a suggested $298/mt FOB Yuzhnyy for 25,000 mt to load for Italy mid- June to cover prior commitments via NF Italia originally planned to load from own production.
The price indicated is viewed with some scepticism in the trade, given offers in the beginning of the week some $4-5/mt lower.
Shipments from Yuzhnyy/TIS in May worked out marginally above 146,000 mt and the lineup for June is so far limited to about 14,000 mt loading on the Abdullatif (11,000 mt for Keytrade) and the C. Pioneer (3,300 mt for Wittraco).
EUROPE
France: Some more forward interest for July, August
Suppliers of granular urea to France for forward positions suggest that trades for July and August delivery have been concluded in the low €320s/mt FCA this week. Buyers still contend that cover for August can be obtained below €300/mt FCA.
The prompt market is void of activity, and is therefore assessed at par with last week around the €325/mt FCA marker. This implies a delivered value around $350/mt CFR into the French Bay given the stronger euro in recent days, suggesting netbacks to Egyptian producers below $315/mt FOB for an intermediary to generate a margin. Sales of July posititions would provide producers with returns around $310/mt FOB if loaded from Egypt.
Turkey: Q1 2015 imports below 2014
Turkish importers of urea for direct application are largely holding off on purchases due to the higher values perceived for Black Sea material following the closure of Group DF output of urea. Open interest is essentially limited to industrial users such as Kastamonu that tenders June 4 for 3,500 mt for June delivery.
Turkish imports of urea in Q1 2015 as identified by customs via GTIS of 356,000 mt were meanwile off by 5.5% on the first quarter of 2014. This despite March imports of 152,000 mt that were up by 9% on the prior year.
March imports from Ukraine of 81,000 mt were up by 23% on March 2014 and deliveries from Iran of 40,500 mt were up by 266%. Arrivals from Russia were down by 66% to 15,000 mt and China accounted for 12,000 mt.
Q1 arrivals from Ukraine of 175,000 mt were up by 19% and deliveries from Iran of 105,000 mt were up by a full 471%. China accounted for 34,300 mt, up from 1,600 in Q1 in 2014. Shipments of 15,000 mt from Russia were down by 89.6% and arrivals from Romania of 9,500 mt were down by 68% compared to Q1 2014.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Offers available despite cuts
Traders suggest that indications of availability of granular urea around the $320/mt FOB marker are available from Egyptian producers despite continuing cuts in output due to erratic supply of natural gas.
Limited prompt trades in granular urea are reported in key European outlets, but indications of interest in forward positions in France and Mediterranean markets would provide sellers with returns around $310- 315/mt FOB for cargoes loading in June when allowing for storage plus financing costs.
Algeria: Sorfert to restore urea output shortly
Algerian producer Sorfert indicated it expects its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up to commercial output shortly. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.
The producer completed loading of 15 vessels in May for contract-holders Helm, Indagro, Keytrade, OCI, Trammo and Ameropa for a total close to 100,000 mt despite the outage and the force majeure declaration that ensued. Indagro was in the freight market this week for a vessel to load 25,000 mt for the US Gulf in June 6-8 laydays from Arzew.
Operations at the first 1.3 million mt/year AOA granular urea line are reported regular with additional nominations made for carriers to load for Europe and Brazil.
Middle East: Producers still bullish on limited supply
Middle East producers cite limited availability for the next 30-45 days in support of quotes for sales outside contract commitments around $315/mt FOB despite lower bids from traders.
Returns on open business in key spot markets such as Brazil are yet to exceed $305/mt FOB, and Brazilian buyers appear in no hurry to secure additional tonnage given inbound carriers with unsold quantities on board.
Despite the rebound in US spot prices this week, forward barge values at New Orleans that would apply for vessels arriving in about two weeks around an even $320/st FOB are indicative of delivered values of $346/mt CFR, suggesting producer netbacks after deduction of freight and transaction charges marginally above $320/mt FOB. End-June/early July trades around $305/st FOB New Orleans reflect returns at $305/mt FOB Middle East.
Firm offers in paper markets for full July positions from the Middle East were posted June 4 at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $295/mt FOB against bids at $285/mt FOB.
Egypt: Natural gas shortages reflected in exports
Shortages of natural gas continue to impact urea exports from Egypt identitified by customs via GTIS, with the Q1 2015 volume down by a full 80% on 2014 to 154,000 mt. March exports of 37,500 mt were down by
84% with deliveries to France cut by 80% to 34,000 mt. Shipments to Greece of 2,600 mt were down by 88%.
Q1 shipments to France of 93,500 were off by 79.2% while cargoes loaded from Italy totaling 19,500 mt were down by 86%, and shipments to Greece dropped by 62.3% to 19,000 mt. Deliveries to Spain were down from 64,000 mt to 2,000 mt.
South Africa: Urea imports through April down on 2014
South African imports of urea identified by customs via GTIS from January through April of 99,300 mt were down by 36.1% on the same period in 2014.
Qatar accounted for 61,600 mt, down by 13.7% on the prior year while deliveries from Saudi Arabia of 28,000 mt were off by 58%. Shipments from the UAE of 7,200 mt were up from zero in the same period in 2014.
April imports of 25,000 mt were mainly sourced from Qatar, and were down by 49.3% on on April 2014.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: GTIS identifies March imports at 729,000 mt
Indian imports of urea in March as identified by customs via GTIS of 729,000 mt were up by 248% on March 2014. This lifted Q1 imports to 2.34 million mt, up by 144% on Q1 2014.
March imports from China of 438,000 mt were up sharply on the 38,000 mt imported in March 2014 and imports from OMIFCO in Oman of 314,000 mt were up by 33% on the prior year. Imports from Iran in March 2015 of 75,000 mt were up from zero in March 2014.
China accounted for 1.72 million mt of the 2.34 million imported in Q1, up by 335% on the prior year. Deliveries from Oman were up by 5.25% to 522,000 mt and shipments from Iran totaled 75,000 mt. Provisional data from the Fertilizer Association of India for April imports as posted in the May 20 update suggested a 872,000 mt volume.
A May 27 statement issued by the Indian Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers contended that supply of urea for Kharif is "adequate and comfortable", citing an increase in imports of 1 million mt and a similar increase in domestic output. A follow-up tender to secure cover to complement the relatively limited tonnage prodcured via the April 10 STC tender and the May 9 IPL session is nevertheless expected early June to make up for the estimated shortfall in availability for Kharif.
Pakistan: TCP awards Dreymoor and Samsung
Pakistani importer TCP has issued Letters of Intent to Dreymoor and Samsung at the prices offered by the traders in the May 29 and June 1 tenders, respectively.
Dreymoor was awarded the 50,000 mt in the May 29 session at $318.63/mt CFR while Samsung took the 50,000 mt in the June 1 tender at $318.53/mt CFR.
TCP has yet to receive final instructions to proceed with tenders to cover the 150,000 mt urea approved by the ECC for import pursuant to the awards made in the above tenders, but is expected to float three sessions for 50,000 mt each at the end of June/early July.
Pakistan: June 1 TCP tender attracts 13 offers
The June 1 TCP tender for 50,000 mt prilled or granular urea for prompt shipment attracted offers from 13 suppliers, each offering the full tonnage.
Samsung reduced its $319.92/mt CFR price in the May 29 session to $318.53/mt CFR and was the lowest in the June 1 tender. Dreymoor was second June 1 at $318.54/mt CFR, followed by Liven at $325.38/mt CFR and by Ameropa at $327.43/mt CFR. Transglobe was at $329.21/mt CFR, Swiss at $329.43/mt CFR, Indagro at $329.74/mt CFR, and Quantum at $329.75/mt CFR. Keytrade, Daewoo, Fertisul, CHS and Trammo were all above $330/mt CFR.
The Samsung offer was down by a mere $0.10/mt on the winning Dreymoor offer in the May 29 tender.
Pakistan: May 29 TCP tender attracts eight offers
The May 29 TCP tender for 50,000 mt prilled or granular urea for prompt shipment attracted offers from eight suppliers, each offering the full tonnage.
Dreymoor submitted the lowest offer at $318.63/mt CFR, followed by Samsung at $319.92/mt CFR and by Keytrade at $332.50/mt CFR. Ameropa was at $332.76/mt CFR, Quantum at $332.90/mt CFR, Liven at $334.38/mt CFR, Transglobe at $334.50/mt CFR and CHS at $338.37/mt CFR.
The Dreymoor offer reflected a netback to the trader marginally below $300/mt FOB from China basis freight for a large carrier on TCP terms estimated at $15-17/mt and transaction costs including L/C confirmation charges around $3/mt.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Malaysia: Mixed signals in exports through February
Malaysian February urea exports identified by customs via GTIS of 100,000 mt were off by about 12% on February 2014, but the January- February volume of 187,000 mt was up by 9% on the first two months of 2014.
February exports to the Philippines were up by 114% to 39,500 mt while deliveries to the US of 30,000 mt were off by about 50% on the prior year.
The Philippines accounted for 92,000 mt of the 187,000 mt shipped in January-February, up by 196%, while
Australia went from zero to 33,000 mtin the two months. Shipments to the US
were off by 50% per the above while deliveries to Thailand of 15,000 mt were down by 68% on the prior year.
Thailand: Urea imports up in April, Saudis supply bulk
Trade in granular urea in Thailand remains subdued due to the wide spread in price ideas tabled by sellers and buyers. Quotes in the mid- $330s/mt CFR are countered around an even $320/mt CFR, at best, and importers appear content to wait for price-concessions from suppliers.
A trader is in the freight market for a vessel to load 25,000 mt granular urea from Tianjin or Jinzhou in China to Bangkok/Kohsichang in June 10-20 laydays.
Imports of urea by Thailand in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 207,400 mt were meanwhile up by 3.2% on April 2015. Saudi Arabia accounted for 103,000 mt, Qatar for 44,000 mt, Malaysia 31,000 mt and Oman for 22,000 mt.
January-April imports of 551,000 mt were nevertheless off by about 14.6% on the first four months of 2014. Saudi Arabia remained the number one supplier with 251,000 mt, but that volume was down by 14.6% on the prior year. Arrivals from Malaysia were up marginally to 97,000 mt while deliveries from Qatar of 89,000 mt were off by 19.6%. Shipments from Indonesia of 30,000 mt were up by 20% on the prior year.
China: Offers for prilled urea up further for export
Domestic values for prilled and granular urea in China were largely in line with last week, but quotes for prills for export were up. Offers for prills for prompt export are at $305-308/mt FOB while quotes for regular Chinese quality granular were maintained marginally above the $310/mt FOB marker.
Mainstream domestic trades in prilled urea at RMB 1,680/mt ($271/mt) EXW in northern China were at par with last week. Trades were recorded in Shanxi at RMB 1,620/mt ($261/mt) FCA.
Domestic buyers are still competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export as high as RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $307/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporters.
Domestic values for granular urea for export were relatively flat at RMB 1,780-1,800/mt CPT northern ports, with the high end indicative of an export price at $315/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. A 7,000 mt sale to Namhae in South Korea this week is however reported at a netback to the seller assessed around
$308/mt FOB. China Blue meanwhile indicated returns marginally above $315/mt FOB for its premium quality product.
The softer tendency in regional export values for granular urea was also evident in the June 3 tender in Indonesia that attracted bids no higher than $302/mt FOB Bontang against the reserve set by Pupuk Kaltim at $325/mt FOB for the premium-quality grade. Kaltim has since adjusted its reserve to $313/mt FOB and is in discussions with traders.
Inventories in Chinese ports for export have increased on last week, but not substantially. Yantai inventory is assessed at 270,000 mt this week compared to 220,000 mt last week. The inventory consists of about 180,000 mt granular urea and 90,000 mt prills. Arrivals into the port have however slowed to about 5,000 mt/day from about 10,000 mt/day last week. Qingdao inventory is assessed at a mere 25,000 mt.
Indonesia: Kaltim scraps sales tender
Pupuk Kaltim elected to scrap the June 3 tender for the sale of 60,000 mt granular urea for June lifting from Bontang. The producer had set the reserve (minimum) price for the tonnage at $325/mt FOB, but failed to attract bids close to that number.
The highest bid received was from CHS at $302/mt FOB, with FertComm second at $300/mt FOB. These were down on the single bid at $305/mt FOB received by Kaltim in the May 22 tender for the sale of 30,000 mt that was also scrapped.
The producer has since adjusted its reserve down to $313/mt FOB and is in discussions with traders. Production of ammonia at Kaltim V is meanwhile close to rated capacity and urea is running around 80% of capacity.

ANALYSIS
AS market remains firm as values edge upwards
Ammonium sulphate
Steady momentum is keeping the AS market stable to firm with prices edging upwards. Chinese caprolactam grade product is on offer at $133-134/mt FOB for June shipment although not much business is reported concluded.
Steel grade AS supply squeezed by demand from NPK producers and reduced steel production, is now pegged in the high $120s/mt FOB.
Brazil keeps showing interest in Chinese AS with prices now quoted at $165-170/mt CFR, but deals have not been fixed. Accessing lines of credit has stalled potential purchases and despite the Brazilian government’s 2015/16 Harvest Plan outlining a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the agriculture support programme, there is not much optimism. Depressed demand is likely to continue considering higher interest rates, inflation and domestic corn prices which are at six month lows.
In the Black Sea KuibyshevAzot sold 3-4,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for June shipment to AFT in the high $140s/mt FOB. The destination of the cargo was unknown at press time. Steel grade AS is reported available from Kherson at $135/mt FOB or above for July.
UAN
Sales into France have been driving UAN market activity with a large volume of UAN-30 for summer fill secured by distributors at €193-194/mt FCA Rouen over the past week. Farmers are taking positions on much of this tonnage before prices rise further.
Abu Qir is thought to holding off issuing a new UAN-32 tender until market values move up further.
Ammonium nitrate/CAN
The June 3 OCI annnouncement of a €225/mt CIF price for Germany and Benelux and the €233/mt CIP price in France came as no big surpise given Yara's May 26 drop in the price for CAN to the same number for June deliveries in Germany
Exports of AN from the FSU remain limited, but the changes in credit availability announced in Brazil this week did offer some potential relief, even if the preferential interest rates announced were above most expectations in the country.
Importers in Turkey still cite offers for AN at attractive forward prices, but have yet to opt to purchase early rather than wait for the traditional summer lull. The cutbacks in Ukranian availabilty via the Group DF closures of output at Cherkassy and RivneAzot might however trigger additional purchasing interest.
MARKETS
UAN
NORTH AMERICA
US NOLA: Barge demand should revive very soon
UAN-32 barges should be in greater demand in coming days. Ground conditions in the Midwest are improving, which should allow for more application work and allow for more in-season refill business. However, suppliers in the interior warn that their retail customers are looking for lower prices on new spot business. This may lead to further reductions from the low end of last week's barge range of $230/st FOB New Orleans.
US: UAN imports still surpassing prior year figures
UAN imports to the US during April were down modestly from one year earlier, at 253,400 st (229,883 mt) versus 281,339 st (255,229 mt), but for the first 10 months of the US fertilizer year, imports continued well ahead of the prior year at 3.07 million st (2.78 million mt).
According to the US Department of Commerce, the major suppliers of UAN to the US during April were Trinidad and Tobago at 75,533 st, Canada at 55,000 st and Russia at 60,794 st. Most of the decline in the April 2015 arrivals versus April 2014 shows up in the Russian volumes, which fell from 146,646 st.
Key suppliers during July-April followed the historical trend led by Russia at 1.04 million st, Trinidad and Tobago at 688,161 st and Canada at 423,347 st.
US Midwest: UAN applications return this week
UAN demand is substantial in the Midwest, especially in Illinois and Indiana. Retailers are finding spot outages as they respond to farmers' efforts to apply UAN on corn fields that have begun to dry out after frequent rain over the prior month. Spot values are unchanged from prior weeks, as substantial volumes of pre-paid UAN still are arriving, and distributors said they are not confident that they can raise prices for UAN from recent quotes of $9.22-9.63/unit FOB.
EUROPE
France: Distributors buying more summer fill UAN-30
A large volume of UAN-30 for summer fill has been secured by distributors at €193-194/mt FCA Rouen over the past week. Farmers are stepping in and taking positions on much of this tonnage as prices are expected to edge up further in the coming days.
Given such large sales, it is possible that buyers now can hold back from securing much more product in the following weeks especially if prices continue edging upwards.
AS
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Buyer interest in AS maintained and prices up
Brazilian interest in AS is maintained although no large deals are reported concluded. Prices are now quoted at $165-170/mt CFR.
As reported last week, low corn prices and difficulties getting credit in the country have stalled potential purchases. The Brazilian government’s 2015/16 Harvest Plan revealed June 3 outlined a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the agriculture support programme to R$187.7 billion, but it may not be entirely supportive for domestic fertilizer purchasing. Depressed demand is likely to remain considering higher interest rates, inflation and domestic corn prices which are at six month lows.
Safrinha corn harvesting has begun and early yield indications have been excellent. This will continue to pressure corn prices, with farmer selling said to be very slow, another downside for AS demand.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Russia's KuibyshevAzot books AS sale
KuibyshevAzot is linked to the sale of 3-4,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for June shipment to AFT in the high $140s/mt FOB. The destination of the cargo was unknown at press time.
Steel grade AS is reported available from Kherson at $135/mt FOB or above for July.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: AS shipments continue formidable growth
Chinese ammonium sulphate (AS) exports for April 2015 grew by almost 100% year-on year at 550,503 mt, prompted by a substantial leap in demand from Indonesia.
Shipments to Indonesia reached 204,641 mt in April, an increase of 348% on the previous year owing to a number of tenders.
Exports of AS to the US during that same month grew to 44,990 mt compared with zero in 2014.
Total Chinese AS shipments for January-April reached 1.6 million mt, up 39.6% on the previous year.
Demand continues to be strong into June with Brazilian importers expected to ship in greater quantities.
Chinese caprolactam grade AS prices are quoted at $133-134/mt FOB for June shipment. Steel grade product is now pegged in the high $120s/mt FOB due to demand from buyers running compaction units and reduced Chinese steel output.
AN
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Buyers still hold off on AN procurement
Brazilian buyers are in no hurry to venture into new purchases of AN following deals up to an even $225/mt CFR, and have rejected proposals from suppliers above $235/mt CFR without countering.
CAN

NW Europe: OCI posts CAN in line with Yara
OCI posted summer deliveries of CAN in Germany, Benelux and France this week in line with the May 26 Yara posting applicable for June deliveries. The producer priced June deliveries of CAN in Germany and Benelux at €225/mt CIF inland ports and posted deliveries in France at €233/mt CIP, effective immediately. A monthly increase of €5/mt will apply on all prices for July and August, respectively.

ANALYSIS
Values move little on supply demand balance
Stability prevails with available ammonia supply and demand balanced. The scenario appears unlikely to change over the coming month.
Most market activity continues to centre on the Black Sea as Trammo mopped up 40,000 mt from suppliers OPZ, NF Trading and DniproAzot for use against business in Turkey and Israel. The trader reports deals were fixed above $390/mt FOB, although its recent reported 7,000 mt sale to Turkey’s Bagfas was said to provide Black Sea netbacks nearer $380-385/mt FOB.
On-going US supply disruptions are likely the reason Koch secured an additional 40,000 mt Yuzhnny tonnes from OPZ and Ameropa for loading on the Jenny N at the end of June. These tonnes were suggested secured around the $390/mt FOB mark or marginally below.
Downward price pressure on such values remains as OCP continues to push for prices below $400/mt CFR for July. The buyer claims its tanks are more or less full and is in no hurry to buy additional tonnage. Tunisian demand is still limited owing to recent strikes and the suspension of phosphates fertilizers output. There are initial signs that production may gradually to normal thereby stimulating additional ammonia demand, but this may take another month at least.
East of Suez, stability also reigns, with sales by Sabic to Mitsui and Fertil to Trammo concluded within the current Middle East range keeping the market balanced. Both cargoes will likely be used against contract commitments in Asia given regional buyers’ overall lack of interest in spot tonnage. This is much the same situation for Marubeni after securing 15,000 mt from Malaysia’s Petronas, with the parcel being used for contract deliveries in Japan and South Korea despite attempts to conclude a spot deal.
Indian ammonia demand continues to provide little cheer for suppliers although prices remain stable at $415- 450/mt CFR. Spot demand is virtually non-existent except for a small parcel sold to Tata Chemicals by Trammo at the high end of the range.
The outlook is more positive in the US where Mosaic intends to run at high rates through the summer and should not have any reason to cut its ammonia consumption. It has recently lowered one of its key indicators for the US domestic DAP market and continues to be content to follow the lead of other suppliers overseas.
Domestic US ammonia consumption appears to be meeting expectations, based on anecdotal reports. Inland ammonia values are creeping down though, likely influenced by wet weather that may cut into ammonia's side-dress business for the US corn crop.
Highlights of the week:
∙Trammo buys 40,000 mt ex-Yuzhnny above $390/mt FOB
∙Koch buys 40,000 mt from OPZ and Ameropa around $390/mt FOB
∙Trammo sells 6-7,000 mt to Bagfas at $413/mt CFR
∙Fertil sells 10-15,000 mt to Trammo within publish Middle East range
∙Mitsui secures 23,000 mt from Sabic under formula pricing
∙Trammo sells under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals around $450/mt CFR
∙Marubeni buys 15,000 mt from Petronas under formula pricing
Short term outlook
Values are set to remain flat on regular supply and buying.
Ammonia versus DAP
With MAP shipments to Brazil taking priority this month out of Morocco plus a good line up of DAP and MAP into Europe, demand for ammonia should remain solid through June. A similar trend is expected for July with MAP and DAP expected to remain the dominant products once more. Renewed demand should start to surface from Tunisia as rock supplies to the downstream plants are resumed and GCT strives to meet potential DAP commitments in Turkey and southern Europe for June shipment onwards.
Caprolactam versus ammonia
Caprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.
MARKETS
AMMONIA
NORTH AMERICA
US Tampa: Bearish DAP signals weigh on ammonia
Summer pricing for US domestic DAP and MAP may well fuel Mosaic and other US phosphate producers' determination to hold the line on ammonia costs, and perhaps even pursue a cheaper deal for July in coming weeks. Mosaic is maintaining an aggressive price stance in order to continue selling into the domestic and Latin American markets in coming weeks, and it may expect its ammonia suppliers to support that program with a reduction in the current $450/mt CFR Tampa price tag.
US: April imports gain thanks to FSU cargoes
US ammonia arrivals in April increased marginally to 564,287 st (511,918 mt) from 515,269 st (467,449 mt) one year earlier, as FSU cargos more than made up for a decline in discharges from Trinidad and Tobago.
According to the US Department of Commerce, April supplies included 359,341 st from Trinidad and Tobago, down from 368,802 st during April 2014. On the other hand imports from the FSU jumped to 88,025 st from 44,063 st over the same months. Another key supplier in April of this year was Canada at 98,261 st.
The April volume brought US imports during the first 10 months of its fertilizer year to 4.87 million st (4.41 million mt). The largest ammonia suppliers to the US during July-April remain Trinidad and Tobago at 3.2 million st, Canada at 933,878 st and the FSU at 437,137 st.
US Midwest: Slightly lower price tag for side-dress use
Midwest distributors have been more aggressive with ammonia pricing in recent days, with quotes around $600/st FOB from inland terminals east of the Mississippi River and indications cloer to $590/st FOB from terminals along the upper river system and rail quotes from the Dakotas to Iowa. Much of the corn ground still was drying out on both sides of the Mississippi River this week, but warm and dry winds increased optimism that ammonia side-dress applications would restart by the end of the week.
US California: Drought remains a drag on sales
Ammonia in California is down at least $20/st from prior weeks, but weaker indications are unlikely to drive trade. The state continues to suffer from a three-year drought. While the state's farm output and fertilizer consumption exceeded expectations despite the lack of rain, suppliers believe farming will inceasingly be limited to areas that can tap into deep wells. Farmers that rely on rainfall will be able to do less and less, further limiting the need for ammonia and other products. Recent quotes for ammonia are cited around $570- 580/st DEL.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Black Sea: Trammo and Koch busy once again
Trammo has secured 40,000 mt from Black Sea suppliers NF Trading, OPZ and DnieproAzot, suggested above $390/mt FOB. The tonnage will be lifted on the Marycam Swan and Touraine this month against business in Turkey and Israel.
Trammo’s recent 6-7,000 mt sale to Turkey’s Bagfas for mid-June delivery reportedly provides Black Sea netbacks nearer $380-385/mt FOB.
Koch secured a further 40,000 mt from OPZ and Ameropa to load June 20-25 on the Jenny N, also suggested fixed at $390/mt FOB or marginally below. Early indications are that the vessel will head to the US given on-going reports of production issues at Koch’s US facilities.
EUROPE
Turkey: Trammo sells another cargo to Bagfas
Trammo is linked to the sale of 6-7,000 mt to Bagfas at $413/mt CFR for mid June delivery this week, reflecting a slight weakening in values. Trammo will use the Sylvie which has finished loading in Rouen for the transaction
Petkim said it will likely issue an enquiry for 6,000 mt spot cargo at the end of June for mid July delivery.
Gemlik, meanwhile, has no ammonia available for export at present with all plants running well.
Toros and Trammo have signed a five year ammonia supply agreement, formalizing their existing relationship. Trammo will supply ammonia to Toros across the producer's sites in Samsun, Ceyhan and Mersin over the five years on a regular basis for the majority of Toros' annual requirement.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Algeria: Sorfert I ammonia and urea units back up soon
Algerian producer Sorfert indicated it expects its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up to commercial output shortly. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.
Tunisia: Recovery in fertilizer production continues
Ameropa confirmed it will be directing either the Gas Cobia or Gas Manta with 23,000 mt to Tunisia this month as AN production continues.
There was further optimism this week that Tunisian fertilizer output is slowly getting back on track. Phosphate rock production at the Kef Eddour mine has resumed and phosphate rock will then be supplied to the downstream plants. This will in turn boost ammonia demand.
Morocco: Imports up as OCP takes another NF cargo
Moroccan ammonia imports for March 2015 at 61,623 mt ran 8.7% ahead of the same time last year, prompted by low ammonia values and greater tank storage capacity.
Year-to-date figures are up 7% at 219,359 mt helped by a strong import month in February.
This year has seen OCP diversify its ammonia supply sources with product arriving from the Black Sea and Algeria. It has also secured ammonia directly from Black Sea suppliers such as NF Trading and chartered vessels from traders to bring the cargo to Jorf Lasfar.
The Gaschem Stade is expected back in Yuzhnny June 9 to load another 23,000 mt Rossosh material for OCP with the buyer claiming the deal was was struck around $400/mt CFR. This has not been confirmed by the supplier.
Saudi Arabia: Sabic concludes another spot deal
Sabic has sold 23,000 mt to Mitsui under a formula pricing arrangement for mid July loading. The vessel has not yet been nominated but ther cargo will be directed to the Far East for use against Mitsui's contract commitments in the region.
UAE: Fertil books ammonia sale with Trammo
Fertil has sold 10-15,000 mt ammonia to Trammo within the current Middle East index range. The cargo will be lifted in July on the Brussels against contract business in the Far East.
Its 760,000 mt/year Fertil I urea line and the 430,000 mt/year ammonia line were shut down last month for maintenance and were due to restart at the end of May. This has now been pushed back to June 9-10.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: No improvement in demand, and prices stable
Indian ammonia demand remains lacklustre and prices are still pegged at $415-450/mt CFR.
Trammo said it sold under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals for prompt delivery to Haldia off the Tobolsk at the high end of the Indian index price.
IFFCO is set to receive a 40,000 mt contract cargo from Ameropa off the Clipper Mars at the end of June.
India: FACT issues ammonia tender closing June 5
FACT has issued a new ammonia import tender for 7,500 mt closing June 5. Shipment is requested 26-30 June Cochin.
This follows the scrapping of its May 11 tender for 2x7,500 mt due to high priced offers. The buyer said it is seeking offers in the low $400s/mt CFR in the latest session.
FACT had hoped to restart its Udyogamandal ammonia facility this month but this has now been postponed until June 1.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Malaysia: Marubeni secures Petronas cargo
Marubeni is linked to the purchase of a 15,000 mt Petronas cargo for July lifting on the Bunga Kemboja under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo will likely be used against contract commitments in the Far East.
Last week Koch bought a 16,000 mt Petronas ammonia cargo for June lifting on the Bunga Kemobja, also under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo is to be used against Koch’s contract with SFC in Korea.
South Korea: Namhae pushes back spot ideas to September
Namhae had now fixed its contract delivery schedule up to the first half of August and will likely push back any enquiries for tonnage outside contract volumes to September.
Around 8,000 mt will be discharged in Ulsan next week by Mitsubishi off the Sanko Innovator, followed by a 15,000 mt parcel from Yara off the Nordic River that was recently secured under a spot deal at $433/mt CFR.
Sentiment that prices may weaken further in the region owing to poor industrial demand remains, although Middle East buyers contend prices should firm in response to limited spot cargo availability.

ANALYSIS
Weaker tone as buyers resist suppliers' price push
Attempts by suppliers over the past two weeks to achieve prices above $500/mt CFR for June business in Brazil have met with resistance and as such the balance of OCP's June allocation has been sold at the same price of $500/mt CFR.
In India, suppliers' determination to either maintain or even increase price levels for new business will face strong resistance with the renewed weakness seen this week in the Indian rupee's value against the US dollar.
The new Harvest Plan annuonced this week in Brazil is not expected to prompt the much needed push to domestic demand currently sought by the market. Initial reactions were positive but delving a little deeper it would appear that the terms offered are perhaps not as favourable as initially thought leavign market sentiment little changed. Although volumes are now moving with a steady stream of Chinese lower grade cargoes continuing to load through June and some 230,000 mt confirmed sold out of Morocco, it may do little to lift the general malaise pervading the market.
In India the sentiment is no better with this week seeing the rupee fall to INR 64 against the US dollar, the IMD revising its monsoon forecast down further and a five day delay in the start of rainy season all combining to place further pressure on prices going forward. Suppliers meanwhile citing demand from other Asian markets, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as potential alternatives in South America are looking to either maintain price levels, as in the case of China or else seek an increase.
There is still the potential for further price increases in the short term if demand in Brazil picks up for June/July creating a temproary tightness in supply with a short window still a concern. For the Indian market only a reversal in the rupee's fortunes can feasibly drive the price upwards. At current exchange rates and an MRP of INR 24,000/mt, a price of $480/mt CFR barely gives a margin of 1% and this does not take into account any additional cost of hedging or interest payments. Therefore attempts by Saudi suppliers to move the price to $490/mt CFR will be strongly resisted by importers not wishing to see their already frail margins disappear altogther.
While earlier indications for US DAP fill numbers were as high as $440/st FOB New Orleans, a sharp downturn this week and a $15/st lower indication for Central Florida railcars from Mosaic suggests cheaper options may be on their way. Mosaic has tried to keep its Tampa and New Orleans price tags roughly in line in recent months, but that may prove difficult if prices in Brazil continue to gain. Spot sales by traders would put New Orleans about $9/mt below this week's export range of $471-475/mt FOB Tampa.
Mosaic's aggresive stance on pricing has the desired effect of making potential imports over the summer look an increasingly unattractive proposition. Having said that, OCP is still planning an 80,000 mt vessel in July even though landed prices into the US, based on current prices, equate to the low $450s/mt CFR US Gulf. For Chinese suppliers, even the lower prices being indicated in India offer a more tempting alternative to the US.
Elsewhere attention has focussed on Bangladesh where this week's private sector tender attracted offers totalling over 1.5 million mt DAP plus TSP. The DAP prices reportedly offered on a CFR price seem to bear little relation to the FOB prices being quoted by suppliers. If all the costs indicated are taken into account, the netbacks to China would be far below $450/mt FOB against suppliers' indications above $460/mt
FOB. Some clarity will emerge over the coming few days as final quantity allocations are confirmed and real price levels become clearer.
On the supply side, more mines are resuming production in Tunisia but some disruptions to transport are still being reported.
Highlights of the Week
∙1.5 million mt DAP offered in Bangladesh tender; OCP to get largest TSP allocation
∙OCP sells additional 150,000 mt MAP into Brazil but at same price of $500/mt CFR
∙Saudi suppliers indicate higher prices in $490s/mt CFR for Indian sub-continent
∙US domestic prices weak after $15/st drop in Central Florida railcars
∙More mines re-opened in Tunisia
Sulphur
∙Further signs of slightly higher prices were evident in sulphur markets this week, as Adnoc increased its OSP by $5/mt to $145/mt FOB for June and recent Middle East sales were heard in the high $140s/mt FOB. In addition, domestic Chinese prices climbed on relatively tight availability. However, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphate demand and its likely effect on Chinese DAP exports, and Indian sulphur buyers also suggested lower price ideas this week.
Ammonia
∙The ammonia market is stable, supported by regular Black Sea buying from Trammo and Koch at around $390/mt FOB.
MARKETS
DAP/MAP
NORTH AMERICA
US: Boost to April DAP/MAP imports
US DAP and MAP imports got a boost in April compared to one year ago, adding to the gains for the 10 months through April that saw substantial arrivals from China through the latter part of 2014.
April DAP arrivals in the US were 216,973 st (196,837 mt), up from just 25,641 st (23,261 mt) one year earlier. Morocco discharged 158,689 st in the US in April, up from just 23,363 st one year earlier. Russian DAP accounted for 56,109 st versus almost nothing in April 2014.
For the first 10 months of the fertilizer year through April, US DAP imports were 736,435 st (668,089 mt), up from 119,770 st (108,655 mt) in April 2014.
Almost all of the gains came from the two largest suppliers to the US during the current fertilizer year. While most of its tons arrived in Q3 and Q4, China emerged as the second largest DAP supplier to the US at 282,936 st (255,678 mt), up from a paltry 903 st (844 mt) during the prior year period. Morocco raised its July-April US deliveries to 383,649 st (348,044 mt) from 254,384 st (230,776 mt) a year earlier.
MAP imports in April were just 66,409 st (60,246 mt), down moderately from 72,541 st (65,809 mt). Russia at 38,528 st and Morocco at 24,211 st accounted for the bulk of the April MAP arrivals.
The first 10 months of the current US fertilizer year through April saw MAP imports remain well ahead of the prior year period. China at 254,227 st versus 2,643 st over the relevant months and Russia at 308,530 st versus 156,593 st accounted for most of the year-on-year gains. The other key MAP supplier to the US this year was Morocco with 383,649 st.
US NOLA: DAP falls on lack of interest
DAP barge values moved down this week, as efforts by traders to find buyers at $420/st FOB apparently failed, although many market players predicted new business could be completed near that level.
At this stage there is very little need for further prompt barges in most major domestic markets. Reports of summer cargoes from Morocco and elsewhere are not believed by all, but they are weighing on traders' price ideas.
At least one major trader is offering a consignment programme to domestic distributors basis open-origin DAP/MAP. It is not clear how popular such a programme would be versus a flat price programme, as inland distributors would have to give up DAP storage capacity with little certainty about their costs.
US Midwest: Modest DAP demand remains
The wet weather has delayed some phosphate applications, primarily for soybeans, according to regional distributors. In addition, hay cutting will pick up shortly, allowing for further phosphate applications on that
crop. Nevertheless, the bulk of the seasonal sales are over and distributors are sitting on their hands with regard to summer fill for now.
Market sources do report some consignment offers from traders offering open-origin DAP/MAP for delivery over the summer, but it is unclear whether this has attracted substantial interest. Prior spot DAP sales in the region occured around $460/st FOB.
US Gulf: Mosaic more aggressive at home and abroad
Business reported by Mosaic this week shows the producer getting more aggressive with its domestic and overseas pricing. The company reported Central Florida rail pricing down $15/st June 3 from prior weeks to $430/st FOB.
At the same time the company reported 38,000 mt of DAP, MAP and MicroEssentials sales to South American markets for July shipment, including a cargo understood to be destined for Argentina. The price tag for the DAP/MAP was cited at $471-475/mt FOB Tampa, with the low end of the range $3/mt under late- May sales by Mosaic.
This would give a equivalent price range of $487-491/mt CFR for sales into Brazil, some $10/mt below the latest round of Moroccan MAP sales for June and well below recent price indications circulating in the marketplace of between $495-500/mt CFR Brazil.
US S Plains: Phosphates done ahead of flooding
Flooding that has prevented field work across much of the Southern Plains is easing, but most of the season's phosphate applications were completed prior to this week. Quotes for DAP are unchanged from Arkansas River terminals at around $460/st FOB.
Mexico: Fertinal comfortable through June/July
Fertinal will load 35-40,000 mt DAP, MAP and TSP this month with the balance of June's production directed into the local market. In July a second Chilean combination cargo will load. The balance of July's production will either go to Bangladesh in the form of 30,000 mt TSP or most probably for shipment to the US.
The TSP cargo offered into Bangladesh through Helm this week has been theoretically disqualified as Mexico is not included in the list of approved suppliers. The tonnes were offered at the most competitive price in the tender, at $455/mt CFR with bags and bagging. There remains an outside chance that the offer could be re-instated although at presstime no such decision had been made known.
As reported in Fertilizer Week on May 13, Fertinal has had some production limitations at the plant stemming from issues curtailing supplies from its the rock mine. It was therefore forced to come into the spot market for two Senegalese rock cargoes. The first cargo has been loaded and shipped with the second to follow imminently. Production at the Lazaro Cardenas plant has been running nearer 70% during this period, nearer 60-65,000 mt/month DAP/MAP TSP, but normal production is expected to be resumed by the end of this month.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Argentina: US DAP sold for June
The US tonnes sold this week by Mosaic are believed to include a cargo of DAP for Argentina, sold around the $505/mt CFR level and giving a netback into the mid $470s/mt FOB Tampa.
Russian tonnes have been on offer at around $515/mt CFR but as with Brazil, there is some resistance to the higher numbers.
Brazil: Buyers resist paying above $500/mt CFR
Suppliers' attempts to achieve higher prices for June cargoes, above $500/mt CFR, have met with resistance. Both OCP and PhosAagro were quoting $510/mt CFR at the end of the IFA meeting last week in Istanbul, but OCP has since confirmed new sales at the old price of $500/mt CFR.
OCP has now sold a total of 230,000 mt MAP (including a small quantity of DAP) for June shipment, all at $500/mt CFR. The price range therefore remains unchanged for granular 11-52-0, at $495-500/mt CFR Brazil.
Price levels for granular 10-50-0 in China are being indicated at around the $430/mt FOB level by suppliers which would equate to the high $450s and more but again this is meeting resistance from the buyers whose price ideas are still nearer the low-mid $450s/mt CFR. For the 11-44-0, the price range in China remains in the mid $370s/mt FOB with suppliers looking to achieve $380/mt FOB. However, buyers are again not keen to pay much above the low $400s/mt CFR level.
Brazil: Harvest Plan may not be as good as it looks
The Brazilian government has finally released the details of the 2015/16 Harvest Plan. President Dilma Rousseff announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the support programme, to R$187.7 billion, termed a 'generous surprise' by the Agriculture Minister Katia Abreu. While the overall level of support is deemed generous, it may not be entirely supportive for domestic fertilizer purchasing.
Farmers rely heavily on subsidised interest rates (production loans) to purchase fertilizers. Funding allocation for these loans has been upped 7.5% y-o-y, to R$94.5 billion. For medium sized producers, production loan interest rates have been set at 7.75%, while larger producers (who take a bulk of the funding) will see rates of 8.75%. These rates are close to market expectations. Last year interest rates were 6.5%. Most of the funding increase has gone towards loans that will be available at market interest rates which are around 17- 23%.
While the 20% funding increase may seem favourable on the surface, it is unlikely to provide any significant support to the already slow fertilizer buying. Brazilian delegates at the recent IFA conference voiced concerns over the availability of credit. While this announcement will provide some relief, depressed demand is likely to remain, considering higher interest rates, inflation and domestic corn prices which are at 6 month lows. Safrinha corn harvesting has begun and early yield indications have been excellent. This will continue to pressure corn prices, with farmer selling said to be very slow, another downside for fertilizer demand.
EUROPE
Turkey: Q3 spot import demand to depend on Tunisia
To date a total of between 200-250,000 mt DAP has been booked for arrival into Turkey during 2015. This represents between 50-60% of Turkey's annual DAP requirement. Demand for imports going forward, for the balance of around 150-200,000 mt DAP, will very much depend on GCT's ability to supply tonnes against any new contract with Gubretas.
Production at the rock mines in Tunisia has now been resumed and downstream production will follow shortly suggesting that, all being well, GCT will start to supply DAP to Turkey from end June/beginning of July and continuing through Q3 and potentially into October as planned.
The last two years have seen a contract agreed for 160-180,000 mt DAP between GCT
and Gubretas. Assuming a similar amount this year, a further 140-160,000 mt may be still oustanding, following the 18,000 mt shipped at the end of May. Prior to this latest stoppage, GCT was producing as much as 55-60,000 mt DAP per month at Gabes.
Further spot demand for Turkey will be limited according to the eventual quantity shipped by GCT. Based on potential production rates through the coming months and other commitments in southern Europe, GCT might be expected to supply nearer 120,000 mt between July-October which would give an overall total for the year to date secured for Turkey of between 320-370,000 mt, not too far off its full requirement. Additional Jordanian DAP may still be required for southern Turkey.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Saudi Arabia: Price indications in the $490s/mt CFR
Sabic and Ma'aden have revised up their price ideas to the $490s/mt CFR for new business to the Indian sub-continent.
Sabic claims to be sold out for June and is now quoting the $490s/mt CFR for July business. It is also offering MAP for South America and South Africa and reports a sale at $485/mt FOB for July shipment. It is quoting the $490s/mt CFR for DAP sales into both India and Pakistan. Buyers in India however continue to quote far lower numbers for new business citing weaker rupee and monsoon concern.
Ma'aden is also quoting the same price for late June/early July shipment to Pakistan. The last sale booked out of Saudi Arabia was the Ma'aden sale to Pakarab, finalised at the IFA meeting for June shipment in the mid $480s/mt CFR giving a netback in the mid $470s/mt FOB RAK. Ma'aden will load a second cargo to Pakistan this month against an earlier sale to Engro in the mid-upper $480s/mt CFR.
Ma'aden is also looking at potential MAP opportunities for June/July shipment.
Morocco: Brazilian buyers resist higher prices
OCP has now confirmed the sale of a total of 230,000 mt MAP, including a very small quantity of DAP, for June shipment into the Brazilian market all priced at $500/mt CFR. OCP had hoped for an increase to $510/mt CFR for the second tranche of June sales and had indicated as much last week but this was not achieved. There is clear resistance at $500/mt CFR on the part of buyers in Brazil.
Europe will provide the other major outlet for June tonnes following sales of 90,000 mt MAP and DAP into both West and East European markets. OCP claims $515/mt FOB on sales of DAP to Spain while the overall range of price is quoted between $505-515/mt CFR for June.
Price levels therefore will remain essentially unchanged with Brazilian sales continuing to reflect the lower end of the range.
A further 25,000 mt NPKs plus some DAP have been sold into Western African markets this month including Ivory Coast and Benin, the latter market taking 12-24-12+boron. The domestic market will take around 30,000 mt DAP/NPKs, mostly DAP.
In total this will amount to 345,000 mt DAP and around 30,000 mt NPKs.
No US cargoes are planned for June but OCP is still aiming to ship an 80,000 mt cargo into the US market in July, split between PCS and Koch. A cargo for China is also planned for July but this may be pushed later in Q3.
OCP offered around 110,000 mt TSP in the recent private sector tender in Bangladesh for June-September shipment. It is anticipating getting awards totalling 75,000 mt at netbacks between $402-405/mt FOB Morocco. Additional tonnes could be placed but as yet final quantities have not yet been confirmed.
Negotiations will start for Q3 phosphoric acid contracts in two weeks.
Tunisia: Rock production at Metlaoui resumed
Further to last week's report that CPG had resumed production at Kef Eddour, production has since also re- started at Metlaoui. Unions are reported to have agreed to halt the strikes and blockades to enable production to resume but on condition that talks will continue to resolve the situation in Gafsa, according to local press reports.
Production at CPG's other mines is being re-started gradually and rock supplies will be resumed to GCT's downstream units accordingly. However reports from Tunisia itself indicate that the transport system remains an issue in Gafsa with sit-ins still being reported in key areas.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
Pakistan: DAP demand/supply balance update
A total of 300,000 mt DAP has been booked for arrival in 2015, around 25-30% of Pakistan's annual import requirement. No new cargoes have been booked since the two confirmed in the last Fertilizer Week report, for Chawla and Pakarab, from Quantum/China and Ma'aden respectively.
Engro specifically has not booked any new DAP cargoes since the two booked and already reported prior to the IFA meeting. With five cargoes now scheduled to arrive in June, there is little interest in prompt tonnage and the next wave of volume buying is more likely to be for July shipment to cover any shortfall in August/September demand.
July-December represents the peak period for DAP off-take in Pakistan. As such, steady demand for imports can be expected from July onwards to cover the balance of import requirements for 2015 - estimated at around 500,000 mt for July-October shipment. Good domestic off-take from July onwards could prompt imports of up to 600,000 mt.
The budget will be formally presented on June 5 but no policy changes are now expected that will adversely affect demand for DAP.
In the meantime Ma'aden has revised its price ideas for Pakistan up to the $490s/mt CFR for late June/early July shipment.
A round up of all sales booked to date is as follows:
India: New rupee, weak monsoon will weigh on price
The renewed weakness in the rupee this week, falling to just above INR 64 against the US dollar (as at presstime), and the ever gloomier reports on this year's monsoon will further concentrate importers' efforts to achieve a reduction in DAP prices for the next round of business.
As such some buyers are now indicating price ideas even below $460/mt CFR while Chinese suppliers are still keen to maintain a level nearer the recent price level of $480/mt CFR. Sabic has even raised its price ideas to the $490s/mt CFR for new business into India for July. Nevertheless, the general feeling is that some concession will be made in the coming weeks, with a reduction of $5-7/mt.
CIL has meanwhile floated an enquiry for 35,000 mt DAP with a price idea of $470/mt CFR with 180 days credit.
On June 2 the IMD issued its second long-range forecast for this year's monsoon, revising it down further from its initial forecast of 93% of the long period average (LPA) to 88%. The northwest of India is predicted to be worst affected with just 85% of the LPA expected. This region takes in states like Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, all the main DAP consuming states.
At the same time the onset of the monsoon that traditionally hits the coast of Kerala on May 31 is now expected to be delayed by five days in turn delaying the start of the kharif off-take season for DAP by the farmers.
India: More than 2.2 million mt DAP booked
An estimated 2.26 million mt DAP has been booked to date for the Indian market for the current fertilizer year as illustrated in the table below. Although the latest shipments are not priced, the level for these cargoes is in the region of high $470s-480/mt CFR for Chinese product, depending on supplier and the low $480s/mt CFR for non-Chinese.
India: DFPCL closes enquiry for 20-20-0+13S
Deepak Fertilizer closed an enquiry June 3 for 30,000 mt 20-20-0+13S and 10,000 mt AS for June shipment with offers to remain valid to June 8.
Bangladesh: Latest update on private sector tender
Further to the report of June 2 on the MoA's private sector tender for 400,000 mt DAP and 200,000 mt TSP for shipment by September, the DAP will be sourced from China and Australia, as originally expected.
The first 120,000 mt DAP, reportedly from Hubei Dongsheng, should be priced at a straight netback to the mid $450/smt FOB, according to the tabulation of offers. However the supplier has indicated a price of nearer $465/mt FOB.
Most of the lower offers for the Chinese DAP are priced in the $460s/mt FOB while the Australian DAP is understood to be priced at $475/mt FOB.
With regard to the TSP, Helm's offer of 30,000 mt Mexican TSP ex Fertinal submitted at the most competitive tabulated price of $455.00/mt CFR, was initially disqualified as it was not included in the MoA's original list of approved suppliers.
As it stands currently, the 200,000 mt TSP looks likely to be covered from OCP/Morocco, LCC/Lebanon, Salatka/Tunisia and Agropolichim/Bulgaria with FOB values back to Morocco in the low $400s/mt. The split would change accordingly if Mexican TSP were to be reinstated.
Initial awards will be made shortly with final quantity allocations to be finalised by early next week.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: DAP under pressure but MAP stays firm
Lowest offers in this week’s tender in Bangladesh mostly equate to a netback in the low $460s/mt FOB. However, the lowest price offered by Hubei Dongsheng should theoretically give a straight netback to $455/mt FOB but this is said by the industry to be unreflective of the market today in China.
Nevertheless, renewed pressure will start to weigh on prices in the Indian market with further rupee weakness this week combined with the IMD’s latest downgrade of this year’s monsoon. This has already led some importers to indicate numbers as low as the mid $450s/mt CFR. These two variable factors are expected to result in some correction in price going forward, possibly around $5-7/mt, which will impact Chinese FOB values accordingly.
For MAP the market remains relatively strong with both local and export prices showing signs of firming. Good demand for NPKs this year, often running at a discount to DAP in the local market, has prompted steady demand for powdered MAP. Prices have firmed up by around RMB100/mt over the past couple of weeks as a result.
Granular MAP for export, have also remained very firm with suppliers pushing for an increase to $375/mt and even $380/mt FOB for 11-44-0 and to $430/mt FOB for 10-50-0. As yet these higher numbers are not yet being seen in delivered values into Brazil prompting some resistance amongst buyers. Availability will remain tight through June and intoe arly July but thereafter demand from Brazil will slow down significantly. Tonnes are needed by September and with a 40 day shipment period from China plus
expected congestion of up to 30 days or even more in Brazilian ports, importers will not wish to risk product arriving too late.
Vietnam: No interest in DAP as season draws to an end
The current season for DAP is nearly over and buying activity is slowing down accordingly. Offers on the border are in the region of $470/mt CFR in bags. Trader offers through normal channels are closer $495/mt CFR but there is little interest at this level.
The volume of DAP imported between January and April this year totalled just short of 250,000 mt, in line with last year. Demand in the last few weeks has been slow as pressures from the agricultural sector have weighed down on fertilizer market. Additional supplies have also been made available from the domestic industry.
to
the
The new production at Vinachem's Lao Cai plant which started production in December is finally filtering through into the market and reflected in higher domestic output. Latest figures for April show an increase of over 50% in DAP production between January and April this year. The volume produced in April reflects a combined operating rate at the two DAP plants of around 80%.
PHOSPHATE ROCK
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Egypt: Rock prices unchanged amid quality concerns
The FOB prices of Egyptian phosphate rock remain largely unchanged since the start of the year and concern about the quality of rock supplies is understood to be hampering demand, according to a number of traders.
Just short of 130,000 mt is booked to arrive at Indian ports from Egypt between the end of May and June 10, on a total of four vessels.
Fertilizer Week's assessment of the rock price FOB bulk Egypt (60-68% BPL) is unchanged at $62-75/mt.
The one recent highlight for Egypt has been the export of the country's first higher-grade (32% P2O5/70% BPL) rock, drawn from stocks at the Red Sea Mine for April loading at Safaga. The mine is still not producing though there is still availability from an inventory estimated at about 100,000 mt.
The cargo of rock, estimated to be around 40,000 mt, was understood to have been sold by Misr Phosphate into India at $94/mt FOB.
Egypt has taken steps to become more competitive in the global phosphate rock market by redistributing some mining licences. The country has previously only exported lower-grade rock, with a maximum P2O5 content of 30%.
NP/NPKS
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Ukraine: NPK imports at five-year low
Ukraine's Q1 NPK imports were 195,000 mt, a 21% fall year on year and the lowest Q1 imports since 2010 as conflict continues with separatist rebels in the east of the country.
Imports from Russia saw the biggest drop, some 24%, at 165,000 mt or around 50,000 mt less than the same period in 2014. Belarusian deliveries fell by 18% year on year to 21,000 mt.
The figures come as an International Monetary Fund mission to the country announced that the Ukrainian economy appears to have shrunk by a worse-than-expected 9% in Q1 2015.
In the full year 2014, Ukraine imported 791,642 mt of NPKs according to GTIS, down by 9% on 2013. Russian NPKs accounted for 85% of the import market last year with 13% of all imports supplied from Belarus.
EUROPE
Europe: NPK prices quoted lower
Activity remains slow in the European NPK market, but with suppliers largely sold out through June after selling product to other markets, sources are confident that higher prices can soon be achieved for the multi- component fertilizer in Europe.
Indications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 have fallen slightly to $320-335/mt FOB while 16-16-16 prices are down by $5/mt to $335-345/mt FOB. OCP quotes European prices for 15-15-15 at $350/mt FOB but deals at this level are unconfirmed at this point.
With high levels of NPK activity in Southeast Asia, India, China and Africa so far in 2015, most suppliers say their order books are largely full through June and the prices quoted are July tonnes.
India's IPL is now increasing NPK imports after signing a three-year deal to buy 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs, DAP and NPS during the IFA conference last week. The deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26.
It is unclear whether PhosAgro plan to reduce NPK sales into Europe in the coming few years in the wake of the new deal in India but in November 2014 the company said it plans to more than double NP/NPK/NPS sales to Europe by 2020.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: Thailand's NPK imports drop 23%
Thailand imported 306,000 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 23% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS.
In the first four months of this year Thailand imported the same volumes of NPKs from Russian producers as in 2014 (224,000 mt) but it saw a 64% reduction in Yara imports.
Malaysia imported 58,000 mt of NPKs in January and February, doubling its imports over the same period in 2014. Russian producers supplied 22,000 mt and Indonesia shipped 13,000 mt.
Malaysia exported the same volume (58,000 mt) of NPKs with 92% going to Indonesia.
Palm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and may have an impact on overall NPK imports across the region.

ANALYSIS
ICL strike ends, US prices continue to slip
The potash market is largely unchanged this week as suppliers attempt to push up prices in Brazil, despite increased supply following resolution to the strike at ICL's Dead Sea Works and continuing weakness in the US spot markets.
ICL agreed a deal with striking workers late on May 28 after three months of strikes which could have cost the company as much as 1 million mt in possible production. The new deal reduces staff at its Dead Sea Works and Bromine operations as part of the company's on-going efficiency plan. Workers have already returned to operations at DSW.
Indian buyers are said to be agreeing quantities for the current fertilizer year with ICL now that the strike is over and a volume announcement is expected within the next two weeks from the Israeli producer. Potash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.
The US spot market has further weakened this week with Agrium believed to be offering June-September availability to Midwest buyers at around $370/st FOB. Overall prices are believed to have fallen to as low as $365/st FOB in the Midwest and offers in the next few months are said to include price protection, indicating that further price falls could be imminent.
The US imported 4.3 million mt of potash between January and April, 24% higher than the same point last year. With Canpotex reducing re-exports through Portland along with higher imports from Uralkali and new material from BPC so far in 2015, the US is proving to be an increasingly competitive market.
The Chinese domestic market is out of season and purchasing activity is slow. The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($323-332)/mt FCA but the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, has fallen to RMB 2,100 ($339)/mt FCA from RMB 2,130/mt FCA.
Europe is also out of season and prices are quoted at €300-310/mt CIF while Southeast Asian potash prices are flat at $310-350/mt CFR, but more Malaysian tenders have been awarded at $310-312/mt CFR levels.
BPC continued a strong month for deals after announcing that it has been awarded 80% of the volumes (192,000 mt) in a Bangladeshi tender this week. The company agreed an increase in volumes to India during IFA Istanbul and was recently awarded RCF's tender for as much as 265,000 mt, with firm deliveries to be made this month.
Suppliers are pinning their hopes on Brazil for the coming months if they want to reverse the weak price levels seen so far in 2015 across most markets. Prices currently remain at $330-340/mt CFR for Brazilian potash with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. In coming weeks major suppliers plan to push for increases to as high as $345-350/mt CFR for June/July deliveries, before again increasing prices for August/September delivery if possible.
Achieving their targets in Brazil should help suppliers recover losses in other key potash markets later in 2015. However, with Brazilian and US spot potash prices currently $40-50/mt lower than those at the end of 2014, the question is whether price discipline amongst suppliers remains strong enough.

Corn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index
Explanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.

NORTH AMERICA
Canada: Potash exports up by 1 million mt
Canada exported 1.7 million mt potash in April, a 3.5% increase year on year, according to GTIS data.
As a result, Canada has exported 6.5 million of potash in the year to date, 17% or 1 million mt more than the same period in 2014. Between January and April, 3.5 million mt was sent to the US and 903,000 mt was re- exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.
The country exported 922,000 mt to the US in April, with 237,000 mt re-exported through Portland.
Including the exports from Portland, in April Canpotex exported 404,000 mt to Brazil, 222,000 mt to China, 152,000 mt to Indonesia and 67,000 mt to India.
Between January and April, including the exports from Portland, Canpotex exported 856,000 mt to Brazil, 664,000 mt to Indonesia, 575,000 mt to China, 358,000 mt to India and 468,000 mt to Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand combined.
US: April potash imports flat but re-exports down
The US imported 1.0 million mt of potash in April, largely flat year on year, bringing its year-to-date imports to 4.3 million mt, 24% higher than the same point in 2014, according to GTIS data.
Canadian producers sent 922,000 mt to the US in April, with 237,000 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic. Despite imports being flat in April, re-exports fell 10% adding high competition and excess supply to the US market.
The US also imported 92,772 mt from Uralkali during April, a 44% increase from the Russian producer year-on-year.
In the year-to-date, the US imported 4.3 million mt of potash with 903,000 mt re-exported as part of the Canpotex agreement. 3.5 million mt came from Canada, 378,000 mt from Uralkali, 140,000 mt from BPC and 133,000 mt from ICL.
US NOLA: Barge market anticipated fill market
Granular potash barge values fell in prior weeks, effectively anticipating aggressive fill marketing from Canadian and offshore potash suppliers in the US.
The $325/st FOB New Orleans business completed in prior weeks thanks to excessive barge supplies in the Gulf likely figured into suppliers deciding on summer fill values.
Canada: Returns to Saskatchewan sellers lower from
US
Returns to Saskatchewan potash producers are down substantially since the start of the spring, thanks to recent offers from some producers into the US for fill programs that began this month.
At press time indications for Canadian granular potash were as low as $370/st FOB in the US Midwest, suggesting a return no better than $340/st FOB mine in Saskatchewan. Even these returns may come under pressure if cheaper offers of overseas material already in play force Canadian producers to match up.
US Midwest: Potash fill offers include price protection
Offers for granular potash available to Midwest retailers during June-September include price protection, an assurance typically only employed by suppliers when they find their customer base is certain there will be cheaper values in coming months.
Agrium is named by market sources as offering June-September availability to Midwest buyers at around $370/st FOB, with price protection through October. Subsequently, a trader offered potash from overseas for June pickup from terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $365/st FOB. Price protection for this offer runs through September.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil: Potash prices stable ahead of suppliers push
Brazilian potash activity is expected to be quite strong through June and July but there have been limited deals this week as buyers return to Brazil from IFA Istanbul last week.
Suppliers are confident that with high demand in the coming weeks and price discipline, prices can be pushed up from the weak levels seen so far in 2015 and are banking on Brazilian increases to help push up other spot markets later in the year.
Prices currently remain at $330-340/mt CFR for Brazilian potash with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. In coming weeks major suppliers plan to push for increases towards as high as $345- 350/mt CFR for June/July deliveries before again increasing prices for August/September delivery if possible.
In some good news the Brazilian government has announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the harvest support programme. Brazilian delegates at IFA voiced concerns over the availability of credit so the announcement may help ease those worries but depressed demand is likely to remain in Brazil, considering higher interest rates, inflation and low corn prices.
Colombia: Potash imports at 100,000 mt in Q1
Colombia imported 100,000 mt of potash in Q1, an 8% increase year on year and the highest Q1 imports since 2011, according to GTIS.
During the quarter, Colombia imported 55,000 mt from Canpotex, 25,000 mt from Uralkali and 13,000 mt from K+S.
Recent deals from BPC and Uralkali to Colombia are believed to have been made in the mid $340s/mt CFR.
Colombia imported 486,595 mt of potash in 2014, a 30% increase year on year with Canpotex and Uralkali providing almost 80% of the imports.
EUROPE
Europe: Market out of season, prices largely stable
The European market is largely stable this week and out of season. Prices are quoted €300-310/mt CIF to Northwest Europe for granular deals.
Some sources continue to highlight tight supply, particularly for standard potash, with most suppliers sending large volumes to China and India under the new contracts.
European prices are unlikely to see major changes until the market begins to build again in July.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: Potash imports rise as OCP ups NPK production
Morocco imported 57,000 mt of potash in Q1 2015, an increase from just 8,000 mt in Q1 2014 as OCP builds up its NPK production, according to GTIS data.
The imports are more than OCP's entire MOP imports in 2013 and already over half of the 109,035 mt of MOP imports in 2014. During the quarter, Morocco imported 26,000 mt from ICL's Spanish operations, 15,000 mt from Uralkali and 14,000 mt from APC.
Concurrently, Q1 NPK exports from Morocco jumped to 88,000 mt from just 6,000 mt in Q1 2014 with large volumes delivered to Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Benin. In 2014, OCP exported 313,000 mt NPKs, with more than 75% going to the African markets.
The Moroccan giant recently embarked on a major expansion with hopes of tripling its fertilizer output in 10 years. OCP also plans to increase its overall capacity of NPKs with the first of its new DAP/MAP/NPK plants expected to start commercial production in late June/early July at Jorf Lasfar. The fully integrated plant will have a capacity for 1 million mt DAP/MAP/NPKs.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: ICL soon to announce Indian agreements
Buyers in India have been in talks with ICL this week following news that the strike at its Dead Sea Works operations has come to an end.
Zuari has confirmed that it has already agreed volumes with ICL, along with APC, BPC, Canpotex and Uralkali totalling 700,000 mt. ICL's total list of quantity agreements should be announced in the next week or two and will likely be similar to the 700,000 mt it sent in the last fertilizer year.
Deepak Fertilisers has confirmed that it agreed to buy 60,000 mt from Uralkali while Chambal bought 100,000 mt from BPC and is currently in the process of buying another 100-120,000 mt, most likely from Uralkali.
Potash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.
Around 50,000 mt of potash is scheduled for arrival in the next week to India, inlcuding a 33,000 mt shipment from APC to IPL and an 18,000 mt shipment from Canpotex to TCL.
Bangladesh: BPC awarded 80% of private tender
BPC will deliver 192,000 mt of potash to multiple importers as part of the Bangladesh Ministry of Agriculture private tender that closed on May 31.
BPC won the volumes at an average price of $344/mt with 180 days credit, excluding the price of bags, a spokeswoman for the company told Fertilizer Week.
The MoA received offers from 21 importers representing different international suppliers.
The potash part of the tender is for as much as 240,000 mt and shipment in September, with individual importers able to submit offers for a maximum of 24,000 mt MOP but suppliers not limited in the number of agents they may use.
The 21 importers offered quantities between 10,000 and 24,000 mt and prices between $327.50/mt and $348.50/mt. These prices are quoted on a CFR basis including another $10/mt for bagging and other charges.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: More tenders awarded at lower prices in Malaysia
Further tender awards have been announced in the $310-312/mt CFR level for Malaysia with prices unlikely to see any increases until the market builds back up in August/September.
Most of the larger tender awards were made during last week's IFA Istanbul conference and action should be quite slow in the near term in Malaysia.
Indonesian potash is believed to be priced below the $325/mt CFR level with some sources quoting deals as low as $315/mt CFR. Quotes from the smaller markets such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand are made at $330-350/mt CFR.
As a result, potash prices are currently seen at $310-350/mt CFR across Southeast Asia.
China: QSL on track for 5 million mt production
QSL Potash, created by the merger of the two largest subsidiaries of QSL in March, is believed to have produced more than 1.4 million mt of potash between January and the end of April.
The level puts QSL Potash on track to produce 4.5 million mt potash in 2015, allowing the whole group to reach its planned production of 5 million mt this year.
The merged entity was created to improve management, efficiency and help increase production. Together their production levels represented roughly 86% of the 4.3 million mt produced by QSL in 2014.
China: Domestic prices dip further during off-season
The Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow. Port wholesale prices are largely stable with some slight falls at the top end of prices.
The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($323-332)/mt FCA but the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, has fallen to RMB 2,100 ($339)/mt FCA from RMB 2,130/mt FCA.
Arrivals of seaborne volumes remain at a stable high following recent contract agreements but some sources have suggested that border rail deliveries may be cut back in the coming months.
In Q1, average potash rail deliveries from Russia are believed to have been around 175,000 mt but this rate is said to have fallen to 136,000 mt in April, with the new level expected to remain for May and June.
Rail side spot prices into northern China are quoted as unchanged despite the recent $10/mt seaborne contract price increase, they remain at $300-305/mt CPT, but Uralkali has been boosted in the last six months by significant falls in the rail tariff to China after a switch to a less-costly route to Zabaikalsk on the border and the weak ruble.
Japan: Potash imports at five-year high
Japan imported 180,946 mt of potash between January and April, a 7% increase on the same period in 2014 and the highest January-April imports since 2010, according to GTIS.
Japan imported 138,000 mt from Canpotex, or 77% of its entire imports, while 20,000 mt was imported from Uralkali. Canpotex concluded its H1 potash contracts for Japan in December 2014 at an average price of over $410/mt CFR depending on grade, an agreement for the second half is likely to be made shortly.
While Q1 imports were down on 2014, in April Japan imported 68,000 mt or five-times the imports in April 2014.
Japan's full-year 2014 imports were 534,365 mt, a 12% year-on-year increase, with 73% of the imports coming from Canpotex.
Malaysia: Early 2015 potash imports up 50%
Malaysia imported 273,606 mt of potash in January and February, a 50% increase year on year and the highest January-February imports since 2003, according to GTIS.
During the period both Canpotex and Uralkali increased volumes by 8% and 10% respectively but BPC saw the largest increase, sending more than 60,000 mt compared with just 7,000 mt in the same period during 2014. ICL's Spanish operations sent 27,400 mt and APC sent more than 25,000 mt.
The figures confirm high levels of competition in Malaysia, which coupled with strong inventory levels and currency depreciation, has held down prices in the key Southeast Asian country.
Malaysia imported 1.6 million mt potash in the full year 2014, a 29% increase on its 2013 imports and
its largest on record. The increase is largely due to higher palm oil output in 2014, which rose 2.1% during the year to 20.09 million mt, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. In 2015, palm oil output is expected to continue its increase but at a much slower rate due to recent flooding and weaker commodity prices.
SOP
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Archean plans to start SOP exports this month
Archean Group's Rann of Kutch Gujarat project began production of SOP in April after a lengthy overrun, the company told Fertilizer Week.
The project, which is set to produce 100,000 mt/year of SOP before ramping up towards as much as 400,000 mt/year, was planned for operation in the second half of 2011.
However, development of the project has been slow and key environmental approvals were not awarded until earlier this year.
Archean plans to sell material to export markets from June onwards and it is targeting sales for Europe and Asia but it is yet to sign any firm agreements over exports.
NPKS
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Ukraine: NPK imports at five-year low
Ukraine's Q1 NPK imports were 195,000 mt, a 21% fall year on year and the lowest Q1 imports since 2010 as conflict continues with separatist rebels in the east of the country.
Imports from Russia saw the biggest drop, 24%, with Russian producers sending 165,000 mt, around 50,000 mt less than the same period in 2014. Belarusian producers sent 21,000 mt, 18% less than last year.
The figures come as an International Monetary Fund mission to the country announced that the Ukrainian economy is likely to have shrank by a worse-than-expected 9% in Q1 2015.
In the full year 2014, Ukraine imported 791,642 mt of NPKs according to GTIS, down by 9% on 2013. Russian NPKs accounted for 85% of the import market last year with 13% of all imports supplied from Belarus.
EUROPE
Europe: NPK prices quoted lower this week with limited activity
Activity remains slow in the European NPK market, but with suppliers largely sold out through June after selling product to other markets, sources are confident that higher prices can soon be achieved for the multi- component fertilizer in Europe.
Indications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 have fallen slightly to $320-335/mt FOB while 16-16-16 prices are down by $5/mt to $335-345/mt FOB. OCP quote European prices for 15-15-15 at $350/mt FOB but deals at this level are unconfirmed at this point.
With high levels of NPK activity in Southeast Asia, India, China and Africa so far in 2015, most suppliers say their order books are largely full through June and the prices quoted are for deals from July.
India's IPL is now increasing NPK imports after signing a three-year deal to buy 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs and DAP during the IFA conference last week. The deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26.
It is unclear whether PhosAgro plans to reduce some NPK sales into Europe in the coming few years in the wake of the new deal in India but in November 2014 the company said it plans to more than double NP/NPK/NPS sales to Europe by 2020.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
Southeast Asia: Thailand's NPK imports drop 23%
Thailand imported 306,000 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 23% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS.
During the period, Thailand imported the same volumes of NPKs from Russian producers as in 2014 (224,000 mt) but it saw a 64% reduction in Yara imports.
Malaysia imported 58,000 mt of NPKs in January and February, doubling its imports for the same period in 2014. Russian producers sent 22,000 mt and Indonesia sent 13,000 mt.
Malaysia exported the same volumes (58,000 mt) NPKs with 92% going to Indonesia.
Palm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and may have an impact on overall NPK imports across the region.

FINANCIALS
Uralkali extends pre-export facility by $100 million
Russian potash producer Uralkali has signed a $100 million increase on its $530 million pre-export finance facility with the Bank of China.
The facility has now increased to $630 million and there is an option to increase the loan amount by another $170 million to a total of $800 million.
The loan agreement, which was agreed in April, is with eight international banks, including Societe Generale, Commerzbank, Industrial Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank.
The interest rate on the deal is LIBOR plus 330 bps margin with a loan maturity of four years. Uralkali plans to use the loan for general corporate purposes, including helping fund its ambitious $4.5 billion expansion plans to raise capacity by 30% over the next five years.
The news comes a week after Uralkali investors tendered for 11.89% of shares in its recently-announced share buyback. The deal sees Uralkali buy $1.12 billion in stock rather than the $1.5 billion it had planned.
Uralkali may now have enough offers to buy shares in order to delist from the London Stock Exchange. With some shareholders believed to see the company as undervalued, Uralkali may now look to take the company private.
Acron Q1 net income up on weak ruble, efficiency measures
Russian fertilizer producer Acron's revenues and net profit increased in the first quarter due to efficiency measures and the weak rouble despite a decrease in sales volumes in its key products.
Acron posted a 59% increase in revenues to RUB 27.7 billion ($445 million), due mainly to a collapse in ruble exchange rates at the end of 2014, as well higher year-on-year dollar-denominated prices for complex fertilizers.
The company's net profit increased to RUB 7.1 billion from RUB 1.4 billion in Q1 2014 with Acron saying that its Oleniy Ruchey mine achieved record operating results of 100,000 mt of apatite concentrate during March.
On a dollar basis using Acron's average exchange rate across Q1 2015 and Q1 2014, revenues fell to $444.7 million against $496.3 million, but net profit increased to $113.6 million from $41.1 million.
The company said the output of its key products was 1.6 million mt, down 2% year on year, and its sales of key products fell 4% to 1.5 million mt due to maintenance at its Novgorod-based facility.
Acron noted that costs of goods sold increased, mainly due to higher comparative potash prices, which are pegged to the dollar exchange rate. The company also posted an exchange loss of RUB 1.4 billion from the revaluation of its assets, loans and liabilities.
PhosAgro boosts Q1 net profits on higher production
Russian fertilizer producer PhosAgro increased net profits in its first quarter on a dollar basis to $228 million from $55 million the previous year as production, sales volumes and most prices increased.
The company said total fertilizer production increased 8% year-on-year due to efficiency measures, with its phosphates operations recording a 4% increase in sales volumes to 1.3 million mt. Its nitrates division saw a 3% fall in sales volumes to 412,500 mt.
First quarter revenues were up 71% on a rouble basis but due to the massive depreciation of the currency against the dollar at the end of 2014, revenues are down on a dollar basis to $808 million from $841 million.
The company said it received higher realised prices on a rouble basis for DAP/MAP and NPK exports during Q1. Average DAP prices in Q1 were $483/mt FOB Tampa, up 2% year on year.
On a rouble basis, revenue from DAP/MAP sales more than doubled and revenue from phosphate rock sales increased 22%, but sales volumes decreased 27% due to higher internal consumption. NPK export sales more than doubled.
PhosAgro saw a net loss in Q4 from revaluation of USD and EUR denominated loans but a clean slate in 2015 coupled with higher production has given the company a good start to the year.
In February, PhosAgro commissioned a new phosphate-potash-sulphur fertilizer production line with capacity of 100,000mt/year and the company said it now intends to invest further in expansion of the number of NPK and other fertilizer grades it produces.
In the upcoming summer season PhosAgro expects significant buying activity from India and Brazil and it noted that it now expects India's 2015 DAP imports to reach 5.5-6 million mt in 2015, at least a 2 million mt increase on last year.
During the IFA conference this week, PhosAgro agreed a three-year deal to sell 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs to India.
The deal between PhosAgro and IPL is over a three year period suggesting around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26 but also including DAP and NPS.
PhosAgro has not shipped any NPKs to India in such sizeable volumes since 2012 when it exported an estimated 250,000 mt through Ameropa against its contract with IFFCO.
The company said in a conference call May 29 that individual sales as part of the contract would be made on a spot basis. At today's prices and freights, Indian netbacks on Russian DAP are in the low/mid $450s/mt FOB Baltic, significantly lower than potential netbacks from Brazil at current price levels of $500/mt CFR.
Despite the current weak rupee, PhosAgro forecasts significantly higher NPK demand outweighing domestic output in the coming years due to high internal production costs. During 2014, domestic NPK production rose by 13% to 7.8 million mt and so far in 2015, domestic production has risen further.
The new PhosAgro deal could also have an effect on potash demand in India. If domestic NPK production slows due to the imported NPKs then the recent trend of higher potash buying could slow.
FREIGHT/SHIPPING
K+S begins modifications at Port Moody
German potash producer K+S and Pacific Coast Terminals Co. have begun modifications to the existing bulk handling facility in Port Moody, Canada, in order for the site to take potash from the Legacy project.
K+S Potash Canada is currently on track and on budget to start potash production in late 2016 at the CAD
4.1billion Legacy solution mine in Saskatchewan. The company plans to ramp up production to two million mt/year by 2017 before a gradual extension of the annual capacity to 2.86 million mt of potash products.
The handling facility stores and transports potash products arriving by rail and will allow K+S access to its international clients from the Legacy site. Completion of the modifications is planned for late 2016.

ICL comes to agreement with striking workers
After three months of strikes at Israeli fertilizer producer ICL's Dead Sea Potash Works and Neot Hovav Bromine operations in Israel, an agreement has been reached and employees will return to work immediately, ICL said in a press release May 29.
Management at ICL have now signed an agreement with Israel's General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) and unions representing ICL Israel employees. The deal provides a new framework for ICL's restructuring plan and allows for a reduction in the workforce at both production facilities.
According to the final terms, the labour reduction at ICL Dead Sea Works and ICL Neot Hovav will total 248 employees, 210 of which will be through an early retirement plan.
The strike, which began in mid-February, cost ICL $164 million in lost revenues in Q1 and net income was hit by $76 million. The company said the impact of the strike will be higher in Q2 due to depleted inventories of bromine during the quarter.
ICL said that while the strike was costly it considers it to have been 'a worthwhile investment in the future of its plants in Israel' and the economic benefits of the strike will 'significantly exceed its costs'.
The company said that DSW facilities have been less competitive in the past few years due to lower potash prices and high labour costs in Israel, while an 'unfriendly business environment… by the previous Israeli government' led to higher taxes and royalties.
The strikes are likely to have cost ICL as much as 1 million mt in production from the Dead Sea Works so far in 2015. The company has managed to make divestments to boost its net income in Q1 and covered some of its lost sales volumes by increasing production at its Spanish and UK operations.
The company also still managed to agree its major Chinese potash contracts for 2015, with buyers agreeing that volumes which ICL fails to provide in the first half of the year due to the strikes can be replaced by extra volumes in the second half of the year.
Ending the strike comes just in time for ICL to agree a new contract with its Indian buyers, after Belarusian potash producer BPC agreed its volumes during the IFA Conference this week. Last year ICL agreed roughly
700,000 mt in quantities to its Indian customers and the company is likely to have already conducted discussions over new contracts during the conference in anticipation of the end to strikes.
Despite it already being nearly two months into the new fertilizer year in India, potash demand is expected to increase in the country and ICL should be able to agree similar quantities to its Indian buyers.
TRADE
ICL may owe Haifa over potash pricing
Israeli fertilizer producer ICL may have to make a provision in its Q2 financial statements to pay as much as $70 million to Haifa over potash pricing in 2012-13, Israeli publication The Marker reported on May 2.
The most recent ruling in on-going arbitration proceedings regarding potash pricing from ICL to Haifa for its NOP requirements has found that settlement over payments between the two parties needs to be made for between 2011 and 2013.
An examiner for the court ruled that a refund should be paid by Haifa to ICL's Dead Sea Works operations for 2011 but that for both 2012 and 2013, Haifa can request returns from ICL to meet a court formula agreement over pricing.
In early 2014, an Israeli court ruled that quarterly sales prices for potash to Haifa would be based on a formula rather than a set price by ICL.
ICL may now be liable to pay $60-70 million to Haifa, according to The Marker.
In ICL's 2014 financial report it said that the company was unlikely to have to pay significant amounts in respect to 2009-2013 and no provisions were included in the 2014 figures.
ICL says it is reviewing the court ruling and intends to petition the court against it over the 2012-13 decision. The company also noted that it was is reviewing any provision that may need to be made in its Q2 financial statements.

ANALYSIS
Sales prices climb but market participants cautious
Further signs of slight price increases were evident in sulphur markets this week, particularly on Middle Eastern FOB levels, but market participants including sellers are cautious about prices rising too quickly and leading to a subsequent slump.
Adnoc increased its OSP by $5/mt to $145/mt FOB for June, following Tasweeq’s $2/mt increase of its QSP to $141/mt FOB.
In addition, recent spot sales out of the Middle East have been reported from the low $140s/mt FOB to the high $140s/mt FOB, and KPC’s most recent 30,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded at $146/mt FOB this week, up from the low $140s/mt FOB of its 20,000 mt tender last week. Availability is understood to be tight, and sellers report enquiries for both spot volumes and contractual top-ups.
Market participants are waiting for Aramco to finalise its July price on June 10. An increase is expected, though the scale of the increase has yet to be determined.
In addition, Middle Eastern sellers are hoping to finalise all Q3 contract talks next week in advance of Ramadan, and these talks will also provide indications of the market direction.
Domestic Chinese prices also climbed, as domestic availability was relatively tight. Sources also suggested that buyers in China were demonstrating a greater willingness to accept import prices in the high $150s/mt CFR than last week.
However, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphates demand, as monsoon delays and the weak rupee add further impetus for declines in Chinese phosphate export prices, and this may make Chinese phosphate producers more cautious about buying sulphur. Indian sulphur price ideas were also heard lower on the week, and the country's Q1 imports were down 3.8% despite March imports climbing 28.2% from a year earlier.
OCP remains out of the sulphur spot market at present as it is content with term contracts. The country’s Q1 imports climbed 8.8% on the year.
Elsewhere, the US imported another 27,500 mt of sulphur form Kazakhstan in April, further demonstrating that US sulphur buyers are implementing their previously-stated strategy to bring in solid sulphur from overseas and re-melt in the US Gulf.
Meanwhile, Fertilizer Week published its June short-term forecast, which suggests a similar trend to the previous month’s iteration, although forecast levels are lower overall given a greater than anticipated decline in May prices.
Highlights of the week:
∙Adnoc increases OSP to $145/mt FOB for June
∙KPC's latest 30,000 mt tender goes at $146/mt FOB
∙Middle East spot reported in mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB
∙Chinese domestic prices climb further
∙Market concerned over Indian phosphate outlook
∙Moroccan Q1 imports up 8.8%
∙US brings in further Kazakh sulphur in April
∙Fertilizer Week published latest short term forecast

SULPHUR
NORTH AMERICA
US: Further solid sulphur brought in from Kazakhstan
The US imported another sulphur cargo from Kazakhstan in April, bringing in 27,500 mt from the FSU country. This further demonstrates that US sulphur buyers are implementing their previously-stated strategy to bring in solid sulphur from overseas and re-melt in the US Gulf.
Mosaic’s 1 million mt/year sulphur melter at its New Wales Florida phosphate complex, planned as a way to benefit from global sulphur availability, is expected to start in Q4 2015. It will reduce the buyer’s dependency on North American suppliers of molten sulphur. In the meantime, Mosaic is expected to take advantage of
existing sulphur melting facilities at Galveston, Texas, to enable it to bring in formed sulphur from overseas. After melting at Galveston, the company would use its molten carrier to transport product to Tampa.
The ability to use sulphur from a wider range of sources should give buyers more negotiating power and reduce risks around availability.
In 2014, the US imported 25,000 mt from Kazakhstan in July and 27,500 mt in September. Prior to this it had not imported Kazakh sulphur.
US: Q1 sulphur production down 2.3%
US sulphur production for March 2015 was 724,000 mt, down 4.5% year on year and up 8.4% from the previous month, according to the US Geological Survey.
This brought total production for the first quarter to 2.12 million mt, down 2.3% year on year.
March shipments were down 4.3% on the year at 728,000 mt, while Q1 shipments were down 3.2% at 2.14 million mt.
US stockpiles in March were 137,000 mt.
FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)
Russia: Contractual loading running smoothly
Sellers of Russian product report that they are currently distributing contractual volumes to buyers and everything is running smoothly.
A large proportion of Russian deliveries is aimed at Morocco.
Q2 contract talks for Russian supply are unlikely to commence until late June.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Jordan: JPMC closes 50,000 mt tender
JPMC closed a tender June 2 for 50,000 mt sulphur for July 15-20 arrival, but no conclusion was yet disclosed.
The buyer's last tender for 50,000 mt, which closed on May 7, was awarded at around $155/mt CFR.
Middle East: Spot prices firm on lack of availability
Recent spot business from the Middle East has been reported as high as $148/mt FOB, although there have also been spot sales this week in the low $140s/mt FOB.
Sellers report steady spot enquiries and enquiries for top-ups on term contracts, but say they have little to no availability for June.
One seller noted that the majority of bid levels had risen from the mid-$130s/mt FOB last week to the low-to- mid-$140s/mt FOB this week.
Market participants awaited confirmation of Saudi Aramco July price, which is expected to be finalised June 10. The seller is likely to increase the price from its June level of $142/mt FOB Jubail.
In addition, Middle Eastern sellers plan to conduct Q3 contract talks next week, as producers want to settle agreements before Ramadan begins June 18.
Kuwait: KPC 30,000 mt tender at $146/mt FOB
KPC’s tender for 20,000 mt sulphur that closed on May 26 was reportedly awarded in the low $140s/mt FOB.
The seller is understood to have subsequently sold another 30,000 mt cargo this week that closed June 2 at $146/mt FOB.
Morocco: Q1 sulphur imports increase 9%
Morocco’s imports of sulphur for Q1 increased 8.8% year on year to 1.08 million mt.
Russia and the UAE were the main suppliers in Q1, as the source of 341,810 mt and 314,997 mt respectively.
Other key sources were the US (114,611 mt), Poland (98,008 mt), Spain (68,334 mt) and Kuwait (62,996 mt).
Morocco: OCP sticking to contracts for now
The Moroccan spot sulphur market has remained quiet in recent weeks, with OCP suggesting that it is focusing on term contracts and waiting for lower prices.
Meanwhile, Q2 contracts for North African granular business are assessed at $145-152/mt CFR based on feedback from buyers and sellers. Although buyer sources had suggested prices as low as $131.50/mt CFR, this level is not considered representative of mainstream business.
UAE: Adnoc posts $145/mt FOB June OSP
Adnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $145/mt FOB Ruwais for June, up $5/mt from its May level.
This represents a delivered price to India in the high $150s/mt CFR.
The price is roughly in line with market expectations, and further indicates that prices have stabilised and show some potential for increasing.
It follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for June at $141/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $2/mt from its April level.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Price ideas lower despite increases elsewhere
IFFCO reportedly bought two cargoes from Japanese suppliers at $154/mt CFR and 158/mt CFR respectively, though it was not confirmed whether this was contractual business.
This is below where prices have been pegged recently and below FACT’s tender purchase two weeks ago in the mid-$160s/mt CFR, and Indian buyers have expressed lower price ideas this week.
If the purchases were on a spot basis, the price level is surprising given that global prices have firmed in recent weeks.
RCF has not yet decided on an award for its 10,000 mt tender that closed May 15. Offers were INR 9,093/mt EXW from Reliance, INR 10,515/mt EXW from Essar, INR 8,485/mt EXW from MRPL, and $170/mt CFR from Swiss Singapore.
India: March sulphur imports climb 28% year on year
India’s March imports of sulphur increased 28.2% year on year to 145,734 mt, leaving Q1 imports down 3.8% at 382,483 mt.
Most of the tonnes came from the Middle East, with 65,933 mt from Saudi Arabia, 31,500 mt from Qatar, 27,410 mt from Kuwait, and 6,210 mt from Bahrain.
In addition, Japan supplied 12,015 mt and
Turmenistan supplied 1,693 mt.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also the largest suppliers for the quarter overall, at 170,287 mt and 103,430 mt respectively.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Prices firming but concerns overs phosphates
Domestic sulphur prices in China increased further this week, rising around RMB 20/mt.
Prices at ports were in the RMB 1,200-1,240/mt FCA range, with the upper end of this representing offer levels at Fangcheng.
One key driver for increases was lower production levels from Sinopec’s Puguang refinery. The producer again increased its own prices, with its price at Wenzhou port now RMB 1,190/mt FCA and its ex-factory price at RMB 1,170/mt FCA. In addition to lowering its production, Pugaung has successfully lowered its stock levels over recent weeks, leaving domestic supply tighter.
Another driver of price increases was the higher FOB prices posted by Middle Eastern sellers and tight international availability of spot product, although this has not yet had a large effect on Chinese CFR prices.
Many Chinese traders had expected price declines, and so don’t currently have much stock. Although they may be willing to accept as high as $157-158/mt CFR, they would resist anything higher, as even this level leaves little margin on sales.
However, sources reported an increased willingness on the part of buyers to accept levels in the high
$150s/mt CFR that were still being resisted last week. One export seller even suggested that they had been told Chinese phosphate producers would be willing to pay $165/mt CFR.
On the other hand, although Chinese phosphate production is relatively stable, there are concerns over export prices. Indian demand for phosphate imports is being damaged by delays in the monsoon as well as weakness in the rupee, and this is adding pressure on Chinese phosphate export prices to decrease. Phosphate producers are therefore somewhat cautious in buying sulphur.
Little change was reported in crushed lump or molten sulphur.
Inventories climbed to around 980,000 mt, and are expected to reach over 1 million mt within the coming week.
Some traders expect prices to reach RMB 1,250/mt FCA soon, but others believe that this view is overly optimistic.
Japan: April sulphur exports climb 3.5%
Japan’s April exports of sulphur increased 3.5% year on year to 89,357 mt, though exports for the first four months of the year were still down 6.4% at 400,726 mt.
The vast majority of the tonnes, 61,756 mt, went to China.
Other destinations included India (11,997 mt), Indonesia (11,498 mt), and South Korea (2,717 mt).

MONTHLY FORECASTS
Sulphuric Acid
Notes: (1) This report forecasts the Chile Sulphuric Acid CFR spot price and the NW Europe Spot price on an average monthly basis.
ANALYSIS
Asian prices climb further as Indian demand persists with tight availability
Asian spot prices for export were again assessed higher this week, as business was reported as high as
$30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, with suggestions that some deals may have even been done slightly higher than that.
The price hikes have been driven by tight regional availability combined with firm Indian spot demand.
Indian buyers have continued to seek spot imports of sulphuric acid, with recent prices pegged as high as the $70s/mt CFR. India’s Q1 imports were up 22.6% at 282,717 mt, following a 77.6% year-on-year increase in March volumes.
But although Asian spot prices have increased recently, they are still not high enough to attract export sales interest from Two Lions, which is focused on the more attractive domestic market where prices have also been rising as a result of maintenance turnarounds.
The Chilean market remains quiet with a lack of spot activity. Most sources pegged prices at $80-85/mt CFR, saying that some interest was starting to surface, but others said that anything above $80/mt CFR would be difficult to achieve. Chile’s April imports dropped 26% on the year, leaving total imports to date down slightly.
European spot prices were stable, with little new business this week and disputes on true notional levels. The most recent traded levels are in line with prices of the past several months, although reports that last week’s sales to Argentina went in the mid-$80s/mt CFR out of Antwerp suggested that the tendency may be downwards rather than upwards.
Morocco is still absent from the spot market, though a buyer source suggested that offer levels from Europe were declining. Trade data showed that the country’s Q1 imports were up by nearly a third, though it is still unlikely that its total 2015 imports will reach the level of the previous year.
Meanwhile, Fertilizer Week's short term forecast for June displayed little change from the previous month's iteration, with global prices not expected to change much throughout the forecast period, though there is greater uncertainty over the later months in the forecast.
Highlights of the week:
∙Asian FOB spot prices rise further
∙Indian spot demand persists into $70s/mt CFR
∙Indian Q1 imports climb after strong March
∙Two Lions focused on domestic market
∙Chilean spot market quiet with prices pegged around $80/mt CFR
∙Chile's April imports plunge
∙Morocco sticks to term contracts but reports lower offers
∙Fertilizer Week publishes latest short term forecast
Base Metals
Base metals prices reached their lowest levels since mid-April, or in the case of copper since March, before recovering slightly later in the week but remaining below last week's levels. Reported macroeconomic indicators were relatively weak, and concerns are still evident over both Chinese weakness and a possible Greek exit from the eurozone. LME copper was down to $5,991.50/mt for cash.
DAP & Sulphur
There is more smoke than fire in US phosphate and even global phosphate trade this week. Mosaic has taken a more aggressive stance on US domestic DAP pricing this week. This supports expectations that the US phosphate giant intends to continue running as close to capacity as it can over the summer.
Further signs of slightly higher prices were evident in sulphur markets this week, as Adnoc increased its OSP by $5/mt to $145/mt FOB for June and recent Middle East sales were heard in the high $140s/mt FOB. In addition, domestic Chinese prices climbed on relatively tight availability. However, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphates demand and its likely effect on Chinese phosphates exports, and Indian sulphur buyers also suggested lower price ideas this week.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
NORTH AMERICA
US: April sulphuric acid imports climb 28%
US imports of sulphuric acid for April climbed 28.2% year on year to 291,283 mt, leaving imports for the first four months up 8.4% at 1.12 million mt.
Although the majority of the April imports came from Canada, which supplied 159,993 mt, and much of the remainder came from Mexico, which supplied 58,001 mt, the US continued to increase its imports from Europe.
For April, Finland supplied 18,902 mt, Belgium supplied 18,121 mt, Germany supplied 18,058 mt, and Poland supplied 17,451 mt.
Canada: April sulphuric acid exports up 2.5%
Canada’s April exports of sulphuric acid climbed 2.5% year on year, but imports for the first four months of the year were still down 0.9% at 643,504 mt.
Effectively all of the tonnes went to the US.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
Chile: April acid imports plunge 26%
Chile's April imports of sulphuric acid dropped 25.8% year on year to 176,276 mt, leaving imports for the first four months of the year down 2.2% at 778,487 mt.
Most of the April tonnes came from Peru, which supplied 104,130 mt, with the remainder coming from Brazil and Japan, which supplied 40,631 mt and 31,419 mt respectively.
These same three countries supplied almost all of Chile’s February and March imports too.
Chile: Spot market quiet and notional levels disputed
The spot sulphuric acid market in Chile remains quiet, with no new business reported this week.
Although most sources continue notionally to peg prices at $80-90/mt CFR, with the majority at the lower end of this range, others argue that this is unrealistic, with some in Chile suggesting that any sales above $80/mt CFR would be difficult to achieve. Indeed, some traders have suggested that recent business has been much closer to the $80/mt CFR.
There is little sign of an increase in Chilean spot demand, but with fewer tonnes leaving Mexico and Peruvian exports also likely to inch down, buyers may be more active in the spot market in H2.
Peru: March sulphuric acid exports down 8.5%
Peru’s March exports of sulphuric acid declined 8.5% year on year to 139,710 mt, although this was the largest monthly volume of exports since the previous March.
Total exports for Q1 at 330,087 mt were also down 8.5% on the year.
Almost all of the tonnes for March and the whole of Q1 went to Chile, other than 1,554 mt to Panama in March.
EUROPE
Europe: Spot export prices remain stable
Spot prices for sulphuric acid exports from Europe remained pegged at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with little firm indication of business outside this range.
Although some sources suggested that prices as high as $38/mt FOB would now be realistic, while others suggested that even prices in the $30s/mt FOB would be difficult to obtain, recent reported trades have remained at similar levels for several months.
However, some sources suggested that last week’s sale to Argentina, which was previously thought to be in the $90s/mt CFR, was in fact bought at $85/mt CFR for loading from Antwerp.
Turkey: Q1 sulphuric acid imports down 8%
Turkey’s sulphuric acid imports for Q1 2015 declined 8% year on year to 142,447 mt.
Almost all of the Q1 tonnes came from Aurubis's Pirdop smelter in Bulgaria, although 7,569 mt came from Italy.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: Q1 sulphuric acid imports climb 31%
Morocco’s Q1 imports of sulphuric acid were up 30.8% year on year at 244,767 mt, demonstrating a strong start to the year.
The imports were split between a range of European countries, with Spain, Bulgaria and Belgium the biggest suppliers, while Italy, Sweden, Norway and Germany made up the remainder.
Morocco’s imports for 2015 are still overall expected to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.
The country is forecast to continue importing sulphuric acid in 2015 as OCP conducts upgrade work across its installed capacity. Morocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility. CRU forecasts acid import demand at 590,000 mt in 2015.
Morocco: Spot quiet but offer levels heard declining
Moroccan spot sulphuric business has been quiet, as OCP has mainly been focused on term contracts and has offered little spot enquiry in recent weeks, market sources said.
However, a buyer source suggested that offers for spot sulphuric acid have declined $5-10/mt in recent weeks, and that current published Northwest European spot prices are above offer levels to North Africa.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Spot demand persists
Indian spot demand for sulphuric acid remained firm, with most pegging prices in the $60-70/mt CFR range and some reports of recent business as high as the mid-$70s/mt CFR.
Sources suggested that Indian buyers are having to cover product that was expected but has not been available due to Asian tightness. It is understood that delays in the startup of PPL’s sulphur burner have also
led to greater spot requirements, and some suggest this will persist to October, though the buyer has yet to confirm.
CRU currently forecasts stable sulphuric acid output from PPL this year and next at 660,000 mt/year, though this is expected to rise to 1.02 million mt/year in 2017 and 1.4 million mt/year thereafter.
India: Sulphuric acid imports jump 78%
India’s sulphuric acid imports for March climbed 77.6% to 100,300 mt, leaving Q1 imports up 22.6% at 282,717 mt.
South Korea was the source of 39,231 mt, while Japan supplied 26,970 mt.
Of the remaining tonnes, 19,493 mt came from the Philippines, 8,002 mt came from North Korea, and 6,600 mt came from Taiwan.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Two Lions not exporting as Chinese prices climb
Two Lions is not currently considering spot exports of sulphuric acid, as domestic Chinese prices have been increasing and international offers from Japanese and South Korean sellers are lower than the price level the producer would be seeking.
Sulphuric acid prices in China climbed a further RMB 10-20/mt in several regional markets over the past week. Inner Mongolia has seen increases of around RMB 20/mt as several smelters have shutdowns in the May-June period. This affects Hubei province too as they buy acid from Inner Mongolia.
In Jiangsu, where Two Lions is located, sulphur burners have also increased prices because of short upcoming maintenances.
Japan/South Korea: Spot prices climb on tightness, Indian demand
East Asian spot prices for sulphuric acid exports have been reported higher by several sources, with business reaching $30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea and one trader suggesting that deals had been done even higher.
Some sources continued to peg the upper end of the price range at $25/mt FOB.
Tight availability has meant that buyers have had limited options to meet spot requirements and have had to pay more in many cases.
The lack of spot availability and high CFR levels to India supported the increase, and India remains the main source of spot demand.
A lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi’s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko’s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc’s Onahama smelter.
The PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc’s Onsan smelter shut May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days, though the length has yet to be confirmed.
Japan: April sulphuric acid exports drop 10%
Japan’s April exports of sulphuric acid declined 9.9% year on year to 213,739 mt, leaving exports for the first four months of the year down 5.8% at 926,166 mt.
The Philippines remained the key destination for Japanese acid, taking 86,976 mt of the April tonnes.
India was the next largest importer, taking 56,174 mt.
Thailand took 26,159 mt, Australia took 21,999 mt, and Chile took 10,503 mt. The volume to Thailand is the largest monthly volume from Japan to that country since February 2014.

When both sides in a business arrangement agree in advance to use a set of prices it creates more certainty and saves everyone time – as long as the prices can be relied upon. Fertilizer Week publishes a regularly updated methodology document with detailed definitions of every price we publish. By understanding how we calculate our prices, you will be able to build your own scenarios based on these prices
