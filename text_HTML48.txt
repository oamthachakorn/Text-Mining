ANALYSIS
Sellers comfortable but Asia outlook bearish
A lack of spot business persisted in global sulphuric acid markets, but for many producers and traders no news was good news as broader markets fell under further pressure.
With prices plunging yet again on sulphur and fertilizers this week, sulphuric acid remained relatively unscathed for now at least following the price drops in the latter half of 2015.
Indeed, sources viewed reported business to Brazil in the $40s/mt CFR – unchanged from or even higher than sales to the country in late 2015 – as something to be positive about. This is being helped by the lack of spot sales, for now at least, from Mexico to the likes of Brazil and Morocco.
Mexico’s exports for the first 11 months 2015 were 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014 as the Boleo mine was running producing acid with minimal internal use. For 2016 it is believed that most if not all of Boleo’s volumes have been committed to Chile.
Although Morocco’s OCP remains out of the spot market, this is at least partially because of the large volume of pre-booked tonnes the buyer has arriving in Q1, which may have also left European producers more comfortable in the immediate term.
Spot prices for European exports of sulphuric acid were therefore assessed stable at $0-10/mt FOB Northwest Europe given a lack of new business and indications.
Market participants were more negative about Asian regions, with many pegging prices lower than the current assessment of $0-10/mt FOB Japan/South Korea and/or expecting price falls in the near future, as spot availability in the region is expected to increase.
Spot prices to India were assessed unchanged, but the country offered no spot demand as buyers were comfortable. The country has been a key outlet for Asian exports, and its November imports increased 72% year on year to 95,293 mt, with imports for the first 11 months up 66% at 1.24 million mt.
Pressure will increase on prices in Asia if the PASAR smelter in the Philippines successfully ramps up following technical issues in the wake of its restart. Exports from the Philippines for the first 10 months of the year fell 40% year on year to 131,357 mt, and the country did not export any acid in October.
Japan’s December 2015 exports of plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.
Highlights of the week:
∙Further sources peg Brazil in $40s/mt CFR
∙Mexico exports to November up 75%
∙OCP out of spot as large volume pre-booked
∙Asian and European FOB steady for now
∙Indian demand weak
∙India imports to November up 66%
∙Japan 2015 exports down 4%
Base Metals
Base metal prices finally showed signs of stabilisation and recovery, with increases across the board driven by a weaker dollar as expectations of a further base rate hike by the Federal Reserve diminished. Indeed, copper and aluminium reached one-month highs while lead and zinc achieved their highest levels in four months. LME copper was up to $4,578/mt.
DAP & Sulphur
Some questions remain regarding Mosaic's liquid sulphur needs and sulphuric acid production during Q1. The producer's Q1 sulphur agreement is assumed to have included an adjustment to its contracted volumes to account for its reduced need to make acid. However, since Mosaic has committed only to cutting "up to" 400,000 mt of finished phosphates the possibility remains of the producer either carrying over acid into Q2 or potentially selling spot acid in Q1.
There were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February. The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq's $30/mt reduction of its QSP to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its OSP to $105/mt FOB. Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downwards pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.
Caprolactam
Caprolactam values fell to $1,050-1,100/mt CFR China this week, the lowest the index has been according to CRU records dating back to July 2004.
MARKETS
SULPHURIC ACID
NORTH AMERICA
US: Spot market quiet on limited demand
The US spot market remained quiet, though sources suggested that contractual volumes continued moving.
Some argued that the domestic market was long, limiting import demand.
Meanwhile, spot prices were assessed stable in the $40s/mt CFR pending further indications.
Mexico: November exports reach 131,421 mt
Mexico exported 131,421 mt of sulphuric acid in November 2015, up 65% year on year. This brought exports for the first 11 months of the year to 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014.
The US remained the main destination for Mexican exports, taking 70,970 mt of the November volumes, most if not all of which was likely sourced from Grupo Mexico’s La Caridad smelter.
Mexico also sent 38,280 mt to Brazil and 21,780 mt to Morocco in November, having sent sulphuric acid to Morocco for the first time on record in September.
For January to November 2015, exports to Chile climbed to 225,054 mt from 39,286 mt in the equivalent period in 2014 and 45,066 mt in 2013, while exports to Brazil were up to 178,966 mt from effectively nothing in 2014 and 2013.
The increases are the result of production at the Boleo mine, which began producing copper January 17, 2015 and has been a key source of marginal acid supply.
CRU estimates that Boleo’s maximum consumption of sulphuric acid in 2015 was around 60-100,000 mt, while it is able to produce around 700,000 mt.
In recent months, length in the Chilean market forced Mexico to divert cargoes from Chile to Brazil and Morocco at exceptionally low or even negative FOB prices.
Conversely, Mexican imports for the year to November were down 2% at 168,856 mt, with 99,956 mt from South Korea, 46,086 mt from China, 18,755 mt from Japan, and 4,030 from the US. Imports from China are up from effectively nothing in previous years.
EUROPE
Europe: FOB steady as sellers comfortable
Spot prices for European exports of sulphuric acid were assessed stable at $0-10/mt FOB Northwest Europe given a lack of new business and indications.
Although some sources have suggested lower prices, particularly based on volumes previously agreed for sale to North Africa, most believe that negative FOB spot business is unlikely for now.
Sources suggest that contractual offtake remains relatively firm, while the large volumes scheduled for Q1 arrival to Morocco also leave sellers more comfortable.
With recent Brazilian business reportedly in the $40s/mt CFR, the current European FOB range seems reflective.
MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Morocco: OCP out of spot as large volumes pre-booked
OCP is understood to still be out of the sulphuric acid spot market, and is likely to remain so for the remainder of February.
Morocco has a large volume scheduled to arrive in Q1, and given the weakness in downstream fertilizer markets and falling sulphur prices, there will be little incentive for OCP to seek additional tonnes on a spot basis. The buyer reportedly has several vessels waiting at ports.
Sources are now waiting to see what OCP’s likely requirement will be for Q2.
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
India: Demand lacking as buyers comfortable
Spot prices for sulphuric acid imports into India were assessed unchanged at $20-30/mt CFR, though spot business is scarce.
One source said they have heard business in the $30s/mt CFR, but such levels would likely be difficult to achieve at this stage.
Buyers were pushing for numbers as low as the upper $10s/mt CFR, but were comfortable on stock levels with no strong demand.
Meanwhile, traders said that CIL has actively started discussing contract prices for 2016 for balance quantities, but there was no confirmation.
India: November imports jump 72%
India’s November 2015 imports of sulphuric acid increased 72% year on year to 95,293 mt, with imports for the first 11 months up 66% at 1.24 million mt.
The vast majority of the November tonnes came from South Korea, while 18,643 mt came from Spain. This marked the first time India has imported sulphuric acid from Spain.
Japan and South Korea were the main sources of Indian acid imports over the year to November, supplying 503,750 mt and 479,667 mt respectively.
Imports from China increased to 119,652 mt from nothing in previous years, while those from the Philippines climbed 15% to 66,791 mt. Imports from North Korea also increased from nothing to 45,590 mt.
Brazil: Prices in $40s/mt CFR limit negativity
Sources suggested that the recent tenders from Yara and Mosaic were awarded in the $40s/mt CFR, though details were not confirmed.
Prices were pegged as high as the mid-to-high $40s/mt CFR, but the upper $40s/mt CFR would suggest increasing prices, which seems unlikely given price movements in broader markets.
The Yara requirement is reportedly being met by tonnes from Peru.
Yara’s tender for 18,000 mt for delivery early March closed January 15, while Mosaic was heard to be seeking 12,000 mt a week later.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
China: Domestic prices stabilise as stocks cleared
Acid prices in China were relatively stable over the course of the week, as destocking was mostly completed.
Recent production cuts by sulphur burners and pyrite plants have also been supportive.
Many smelters prices are now less than RMB 100/mt EXW and may be negative after March. This is down from RMB 150-300/mt in H1 2015, and it is likely that smelters may be at negative prices within Q1.
Import prices were pegged from the high $10s/mt to the low $20s/mt CFR.
Japan/South Korea: Spot unchanged; falls expected
Spot prices for East Asian exports of sulphuric acid remained assessed at $0-10/mt FOB Japan/South Korea given a lack of new business and indications.
Sources have suggested levels at either end of this price range, though more believed that lower prices were likely, most prevalently minus $5/mt to $5/mt FOB. Indeed, some sources believe that Asian prices will decline further over coming weeks as availability eases. For now though, firm spot indications were scarce.
Japan: Exports inch down 4% for 2015
Japan’s December 2015 exports of sulphuric acid plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.
The Philippines was the largest outlet for 2015 exports, taking 1.26 million mt, though this was 5% less than in 2014.
Exports to India, on the other hand, climbed to 503,372 mt from 379,532 mt.
Volumes to Chile declined to 319,910 mt from 421,635 mt, while exports to China plunged to 26,541 mt from 114,985 mt.
Most of the remaining volumes went to Southeast
Asia, Taiwan and Australia.
The Philippines was as usual the outlet for largest share of Japanese exports in December, taking 109,994 mt.
Other export destinations included India (18,098 mt), Australia (10,499 mt), and Taiwan (6,500 mt), with around 5,000 mt to each of Singapore and Vietnam.
Philippines: No acid exports in October
Exports of sulphuric acid from the Philippines for the first 10 months of the year fell 40% year on year to 131,357 mt, and the country did not export any acid in October.
Indonesia was the main destination, receiving 64,900 mt from January through October.
The remainder has gone to Malaysia, Australia and
India also received product.
The country resumed exports in August and
September, having not exported any acid over the
May-July period.
In recent years, exports from the country have begun to play a larger role in the regional trade dynamic as the PASAR smelter has operated while adjacent consumer Philphos has remained closed since November 2013 following Typhoon Haiyan.
The smelter shut April 16, 2015 for maintenance and work to increase capacity. The sulphuric acid capacity was 500,000 mt/year and work at the site
was intended to double acid production, though a major increase in acid output is not likely to be felt until at least mid-2016.
Although the plant has sold some tonnes since its restart, it has also reportedly had some delays ramping up, and the current and future production of the smelter remains one of the key uncertainties in global acid markets.
The Philippines’ October 2015 imports increased to 95,878 mt, up from only 2,114 mt in October 2014. However, total imports for the first 10 months were still down 13% at 375,205 mt.
Almost all of the imports have come from Japan, although Taiwan was the source of 8,444 mt, the majority of which (6,037 mt) was imported in June 2015.
