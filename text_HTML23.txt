Market Summary
Suppliers still pressing for $340-345/t cfr in Brazil
In a relatively quiet week while they are occupied by their substantial shipments of standard MOP to China and In- dia, suppliers are holding out for $340-345/t cfr from the big buyers of granular MOP in Brazil for shipments in July. Canpotex has already reported this level for June but oth- ers were mostly around $325-335/t. Low crop prices and a weaker Real currency have made farmers and consequently importers more cautious than last year where purchases are concerned.
It is worth noting that granular prices around the world have now largely converged. Whereas last year the US market was paying more than anywhere else in the world at over $400 per metric tonne cfr US Gulf and NW Europe was one of the lowest due to the weakening euro, now the former has come down and the latter come up. Typical cfr prices in US dollars or its equivalent are now as follows:
$340-351/t cfr US Gulf
$338-348/t cfr NW Europe
$330-345/t cfr Brazil (and heading to $340-350) $345-355/t cfr SE Asia
While India has been booking significant contracts to be imported over the rest of 2015 and through into Q1 2016, concern is growing whether the delayed monsoon rains will cut application during the April-September Kharif season. The El Nino weather pattern is partly responsible for this and it could also have an impact in other Asian markets.
That aside, the supplies of standard MOP are still relatively comfortable overall, while granular MOP demand has yet to match that seen last year.

Asia
India
There is increasing concern that the El Nino effect will persist and that the Indian Metereological Dept’s forecast that the monsoon rains could only amount to 88% of the norm, may prove correct. The irony here is that if successive governments had done something to redress the balance of the N:P:K ratio applied, then the additional K (potash) would have made the coming crop more resistant to drought. As it is the amount of MOP applied is well below the recommend- ed levels, even though demand partly recovered last year.
A delegation from ICL/DSW should be travelling to India soon to finalise contracts with IPL, Zuari and CIL. Observers will be interested to see if the quantities will be similar to last year or cut back due to the strike.
Issue 15-23 | Thursday 11 June 2015
As reported last week, ICL/DSW has loaded a vessel with a second nominated in the interim. The contract price will be a formality at the $332/t cfr, including 180 days credit, level that has already been set with other suppliers.
BPC is understood to have reached agreements with Zuari and Chambal but the tonnages have yet to be confirmed. As noted last week, BPC is also shipping the 175,000t firm and 90,000t option awarded in RCF’s tender.
It is still estimated that when all the contracts and tenders are done, India will have booked around 4.5-4.75mn tonnes firm, while options could take it up to 5.0-5.2mn in all.
There is no news of an award yet in the tender by National Fertilizer Limited (NFL). As previously reported, it received three offers in its tender for 2 x 25,000t MOP cargoes - from IPL, MMTC and BPC. It is believed that all three quoted 50,000t each at $332/t cfr with 180 days.
India: MOP vessels arrived and scheduled so far for June
A total of eight vessels carrying 256,000t MOP to India are known to have been scheduled for June arrival, an increase of three vessels from last week. The new vessels are carry- ing Uralkali material for Zuari and PPL, and BPC material for IPL and RCF.
China
The domestic MOP market is still weak as this is now the off-season. Qinghai Salt Lake Co maintains its prices at Rmb 2,000/t (c.$328/t at current exchange rates) delivered for 60% MOP crystal. Russian standard pink MOP is still at Rmb 2,130/t ($349) ex-warehouse at major ports. The domestic potash industry is preparing to attend a potash conference

next month in Qinghai.
Granular MOP prices have come under pressure in the sec- ond quarter, due to the increase in the number of importers that can distribute it. Prices are understood to be only some $5/t above that for standard MOP.
As of 11 June, the MOP inventory at Chinese ports remained stable at 1.10m tons.
The domestic SOP market is still sluggish. Luobupo holds its price at Rmb 2,800/t ($459) delivered for standard SOP and Rmb 3,000/t ($492) for granular SOP. The Mannheim produc- ers still hold at Rmb 2,900-3,000/t ($475-492) ex-works.
Malaysia
Confusion has reigned in the Malaysian market this week as the Ringgit weakened further against the US dollar, touching
3.76on Monday 8 June but recovering slightly to 3.73 at the time of writing.
According to the latest reports some bidders are retract- ing their offers in the tenders for second half delivery, as a result. As rumoured in our report of 21 May, competitive offers were initially around Ringgits 1,225-1,230/t fot in bags ex-warehouse near the port. Assuming Ringgits 60/t for costs and an exchange rate of 3.6 to the US Dollar, this would equate to around $325/t cfr port in bulk. Others put the costs at Ringgits 80/t which would take another $5-6 off the price.
However, during the subsequent negotiations (“interviews”) the most competitive offers in three tenders for a combined total of 30,000t standard MOP, are said to have come down to Ringgits 1,170-1,180/t. These tenders are by IOI, KLK and BSSB (Borneo Samudera Sdn Bhd Pte Ltd). At 3.76 this would be only equivalent to $295-298/t cfr bulk on the basis of Ringgit 60/t costs, which would mean that importers would lose heavily. Importers are not surprisingly now pushing for Ringgits 1,250/t which would be closer to $320/t (again using the lower cost figure).
For comparison, a year ago this week, the Ringgit stood at
3.22to the dollar and 1,170/t would have equated to $347 and 1,250/t to $372 on the same basis!
Malaysian MOP imports up 40pc in 1Q
Malaysia's MOP imports in the first quarter 2015 totalled 421,000t - a 40pc increase from the year before.
Issue 15-23 | Thursday 11 June 2015
The increase is reflected in a tripling of imports from BPC - up to 87,000t in 2015 from 27,000t the year before. Deliver- ies from Uralkali doubled, to 93,000t.
Canpotex remains the largest supplier, though deliveries fell by 20,000t (-13pc) from 2014.
Deliveries by APC and K+S were stable with the year before. ICL Spain made delivery of 15,000t in January and 12,000t in February.

Further to our report last week that BPC is planning two shipments to this market in June/July and claiming the price is roughly $355/t cfr for granular MOP, it is understood that around 70,000t MOP will be shipped over the two months.
Israel
ICL/DSW is busy loading 50,000t vessels for China as report- ed last week. As ICL has a stockpile of standard MOP that can stand in the open air (almost no rain falls throughout the year at the Dead Sea), it could start shipments immedi- ately. Granular MOP degrades if left standing, however, so little or no stocks are held. As a result, production from the granulation equipment has to build up enough for a cargo to be loaded and the first shipment will not be made until the second half or even towards the end of June.
As noted under India above, a delegation from ICL/DSW should be travelling to India soon to finalise contracts with IPL, Zuari and CIL. Observers will be interested to see if the quantities will be similar to last year or cut back due to the strike. Already two shipments of standard MOP have been lined up in the meantime as reported last week.
Africa
South Africa
ICL is planning a shipment of around 20,000t fine/standard MOP to this market in July. Discussions with customers are expected to start soon.
Meanwhile most suppliers are offering around $360-370/t cfr for granular MOP to be shipped to this market.

Negotiations have yet to begin with respect to the Q3 con- tract price for NPK manufacturers. However, Uralkali will start talks with some of its customers at the Argus FMB East Europe conference in Prague next week. No decision has been made so far as to what will be proposed. If an increase is tabled, some believe it will be for at least €10/t.
The US market drifted lower this week as buyers seek a floor for summer fill values. June/July barges traded at $315-320/ st fob Nola, while other suppliers maintain offers at $325/ st fob. Overall buying interest is thin as market participants await official posted prices for summer shipments from domestic producers.

Brazil
Medium-to-large importers have concluded further June granular MOP business at $330-335/t cfr for deliveries at Paranagua and Rio Grande. Sales of small lots are reported at $340/t cfr Itaqui.
Besides the $340-345/t cfr being offered for July shipment to big buyers by Uralkali, Canpotex and BPC in recent weeks, now ICL and SQM are proposing the same. So far little inter- est is being shown as many importers have warehouses full. Farmers have yet to shift sufficient quantities. One source said that some tonnages where purchase has already been contracted by the farmer, have yet to move out of the ware- house even.
There is also a report that $350/t cfr is being indicated by

some suppliers for August shipment.
A cargo of 11,500t of German granular MOP on the Santa Barbara is due to berth 16 June at Itaqui for Yara. Mosaic is to take receipt of a cargo of 18,424t of Canadian granular MOP on 21 June at Rio Grande. A further two cargoes of Ca- nadian granular MOP, one with 16,400t on the Angelina The Great N and the other with 28,517t on the Red Azalea, are due to arrive at Santos 14 June and 16 June, respectively, to cover earlier sales to Yara and Mosaic. The Canadian tonnes have reportedly been priced as high as $340/t cfr.

Brazil MOP imports down 1mn t in Jan-May
Brazil's imports from January-May were 30pc (-1mn t) lower than the year before at 2.33mn t as demand was very lim- ited over this period.
Canadian deliveries fell by 260,000t (-29pc) to 646,000t.
Belarusian deliveries fell the largest amount, down 327,000t (-43pc) to 434,000t.
Russian deliveries fell by 261,000t to 398,000t.
German deliveries were stable with the same period of
2014 at 388,000t, however it should be noted that German shipments at the beginning of 2014 were negatively affected by the late-2013 accident and subsequent outage at K+S' Unterbreizbach mine.
Israeli deliveries were stable, despite the strike at ICL's Dead Sea Works from late February-June. It is possible some of this was shipped prior to the strike, as well as product from storage at Ashdod.
Chilean shipments halved as SQM suffered logistical issues and targeted other markets.
